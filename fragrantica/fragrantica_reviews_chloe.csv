Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"I loved this at first, fresh, dewy realistic…the dry down not soo much. It’s still realistic but I’m getting jasmine on a cold windy day and the scent has become masculine on me.",,QueenVictoria
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"jasmine used to be one of my favourite scents. this one smells pure and honest - i hate when they taint jasmines with sweet notes like vanilla or disco sugar or some shit. it's not a bouquet, but a corsage. it'd go well with your cool-toned complexion, sensible lunch order, and an office job in a male-dominated field that you need a masters degree for.",11/04/25 07:21,Vaginawhore
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"I'm loving this. A dewy and green sweet jasmine. Not unique, but wonderful. It truly smells like the plant. It's just indolic enough to smell realistic without being headache inducing. I like it a lot 8/10",10/22/25 18:12,Lnn1994
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,It’s blooming jasmine with the stem and leaf thrown in. Kinda dewy green jasmine.,10/13/25 18:30,saho93
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,linear jasmine that is great for layering. does just smell like jasmine + a fixative tho,09/24/25 06:54,konbon
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"Lovely complex Jasmine at first, but sadly dried down very (baby) powdery & babywipelike on me. I love jasmine scents & would give this another try if the opportunity presents itself!",08/25/25 00:29,caution wet floor
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"A plain innocent jasmine. A delicate white flower on it's bush of lush green leaves. It's soft, airy and a bit sappy. All the things you would expect from a soliflore. The scent is linear and simple, making it a great layering option.",07/13/25 19:12,elana_28
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,I love jasmine. There is NOTHING that I don't like about a jasmine scent. This is the perfect layering option to incorporate a simple jasmine into the scent. It's like laying down in a bed of blooms and covering yourself in it. Beautiful.,06/04/25 20:52,AlyssaSchacht

Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"For me this sent is pretty straightforward and a bit old-fashioned. Smells sweet with a little hint of black pepper on me. Sits close to the skin, quite long lasting though. Wouldn’t use it, but if you like good old jasmine it may be your go to",05/14/25 14:45,olya_k
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"Lovely airy jasmine. I could see it being layered over a nice tea scent to up the earthy florals I associate with jasmine, or cheriosa 59 to amp up this sweet sensual vibe. Nothing much else to say just a solid white floral.",04/16/25 11:22,tvzfrank
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"I own Jasmine sambac & marigold by jo melone and jasminum sambac chloé , first one smells jasmine on my skin and it's really lovely but second one smells more tuberose on my skin and it's not the one that i have expected.it's fresher than jo melone.Maybe it's better to try it before purchasing a 50 ml format.I sell mine (50ml) in EU which i used just 2 sprays.",03/20/25 13:20,b78
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"I have been really impressed with this collection from Chloe. So far I have Vanilla Planifolia (which I absolutely love), Jasmin Sambac, Ylang Cananga, Herba Mimosa, Magnolia Alba and Cedrus (the only one I’m unsure of). I find them very light, airy, delicate and feminine.

Jasmin Sambac has a beautiful, soft, freshness to it. It actually reminds me a bit of Angeli di Firenze by Santa Maria Novella, which is one of my favourite spring scents. This is softer and not as soapy, but overall this is a beautiful scent. I’m pleased to have it in my collection. It’s a perfect freshie for spring and summer.",03/11/25 21:13,CaroleAnne81

Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"This is such a beautiful Jasmine perfume. Very demure, light and airy. Doesn’t last the whole day, maybe 3-4 hours, and it’s very intimate but such a beautiful floral 😍 love it",10/16/24 17:00,eva.daisy.88
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"Yum, tried at SFO duty free and LOVE. So light and airy and femme, like walking by the jasmine bush on my street at its most delicious and fragrant",10/01/24 01:02,bjorksattorney
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"This doesn't smell like Sambac Jasmin at all. Instead it smells like tuberose, very similar to Do Son by Diptyque but much lighter.",09/10/24 00:16,jasonx
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"I rarely write reviews, but I felt compelled to add my thoughts for this beautiful youthful jasmine.
It isn't complicated, it is just pure , white, fresh jasmine. Chloe have captured the real essence of a jasmine bush here, beautifuly done. Fresh, green, sweet and airy. It has a very clean aura. I plant jasmine wherever I have lived and I aways place my garden chair underneath it. I will happily sit out there on a warm summer evening and just inhale all of her glorious sweetness as I gaze at the stars. I have searched everywhere for such a realistic jasmine perfume. But they always lean towards the heady, skanky, creamy blend of jasmine that you find in most floral fragrances. Well, I can now end my search! Chloe have absolutely nailed this one. I am sitting here in my English garden, in 32⁰C heat. A cold glass of white wine in hand and beautiful aura of jasmine all around me. I feel fresh, beautiful and feminine. I suppose you could combine this with any of your other fragrances to add some sparkle and sweetness, but she is quite naturally beautiful all by herself!
A Very pretty, elegant fragrance. Well done chloe.",07/31/24 10:31,Missym75
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"I have an Arabian jasmine bush in my bedroom that I adore, I could smell the blooms forever and ever. So, of course, I searched for a perfume that smelled the same. After months of searching and plenty of samples purchased, I blind bought this perfume. I don't regret it one bit. This is the closest any Jasmine Sambac perfume I've tried has come to the real thing. This is a gorgeous, fresh jasmine bloom in a bottle. Perfect for layering or wearing alone :)",06/27/24 11:12,Nyxspiravit
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"After sampling over 20+ fragrances in search of the perfect Jasmine scent for Spring, I have finally found it! Jasminum Sambac by Chloé is the most beautiful portrayal of Jasmine. It is airy, soft, bright, fresh, dewy and clean, evoking the sensation of strolling through a blooming jasmine garden on a cool, crisp morning. The scent lingers delicately on the skin throughout the day without overwhelming the senses. The sillage is moderate, projecting just enough to leave a subtle trail without being overpowering. As it settles, hints of delicate citrus notes emerge, adding a refreshing twist. The dry down reveals a very soft, subtle, woody undertone, grounding the fragrance and giving it a delicate depth. This fragrance truly embodies the essence of springtime and is a perfect choice for those who appreciate the pure beauty of jasmine without any hint of the indolic sourness or heaviness so often found in Jasmine scents. It's a delightful olfactory journey. Absolutely beautiful!",04/16/24 07:25,FattyFox
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"I've never been a jasmine fan, I found all of the mass market fragrances to be too sweet and cloying and they effectively all smell the same to me. I recently went for a Kobido face massage and my esthetician used jasmine oil on my face and I was immediately hooked. It's currently really hot where I live and the green aspect of this simple jasmine scent felt wonderfully refreshing. Once I was out of the spa, I started looking for a clean jasmine perfume and chose this one. It's fabulous! Clean, green, shiny, a little watery - smells like Tata Harper beauty products. It's simple but you can feel some dimension overtime. It stays on for a good few hours. It's my new go to fragrance for those hot summer days. Recommended.",07/19/23 08:56,DiscoPolga
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"This is beautiful! Soft, floral delicate goodness! A bit of jasmine and a lot of tuberose, the green kind. I was about to turn back to the shop and buy it, when it hit me: it smells just like Roger & Gallet Tubereuse Hedonie, which I have and love. I’m glad I don’t need to buy it :)",05/16/23 04:41,Cajou
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"This perfume is a pure jasmine delight! It's so lovely and realistic smelling, with a lovely white floral freshness and indolic character to it. I could imagine Princess Jasmine from Aladdin really loving this perfume. It's super feminine and exotic smelling, which I love.

I feel like a princess when I wear this and it makes me feel so beautiful and sophisticated, but youthful at the same time. I think men would love the smell of this on a woman for sure. It would make the perfect perfume to wear on a date, whether it be on the first or the third. I could imagine wearing it to a party or a ball as well. It's very multi-purpose!

It has moderate strength and wear and it lasts about 5 hours on me. I feel like I'm in a beautiful jasmine garden in India or Sri Lanka when I wear this and I could imagine patting my own pet tiger just like Princess Jasmine did in Aladdin, ready to find my own prince charming.",04/01/23 23:00,WhiteFlowerPrincess
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,This is on my want list. I love the opulent clean smell of jasmine but don’t think I like tuberose. Does everyone get this smell? I’m selling my bottle of linterdit that I’ve only just bought as I decided after the fact I cannot tolerate tuberose for a length of time. It’s I want the purity of this jasmine but do not want tuberose to overshadow it? Is it just because they're both strong white florals?,02/13/23 17:06,Rainstorm
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"My every day scent! Even though it’s just one note, I still think it has depth (much like fresh jasmine does!). Definitely doesn’t smell cheap and works great on its own or layered over other scents",12/26/22 11:51,Wade16
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"Given to me on a blotter as I left Selfridges.. I just looked it up n it's now out of stock on the website.. I guess they managed to sell it all off after pushing it yesterday then. Ah well. Husband loved it the most out of all the samples n blotters I brought back. This is always the way. It is/was, a lovely fresh non-indolic (or v v lightly, first hit maybe) jasmine, slightly sparkly quality. Beautiful, recommend.",12/16/22 08:02,Siv7Stars
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"The dried down is so beautiful, like a real jasmin sambac flower. that's all.",10/11/22 00:17,Mez0Nez
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"The initial spray instantly reminded me of Guerlain Lys Soleia, but less creamy/yellow floral, and more green/dewy. Then I looked at the ""Reminds me of..."" section and I saw Jo Malone Wild Bluebell and thought ""No way. That's far from Lys Soleia"", but then I kept smelling it and realized that, in deed, it is very close to Wild Bluebell.

I'd describe this scent as a combination of Wild Bluebell and Lys Soleia. I own both, so I don't see a need to purchase this. This is a great scent, nevertheless. Light and versatile. Reminds me of summer vacation in Southeast Asia. It's office appropriate as well.

I love the bottle design and texture of the cap.",07/21/22 20:32,fragrance_girl
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"This is Exquisite ! Smells like the new born white blossom on the morning, with moist dew and leaf.
The scent is very light and airy, in the same time maintains good projection and longevity which is impressive.
But the big problem for me is Jasmine is only a supporting role in here 0_0
Towards the dry-down, the white floral scent mostly provided by Tuberose.

Strongly agree with comments below:
1. Don't blind buy it if you hate Tuberose 2. It is a light version of Do Son",03/24/22 09:18,Slightly
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"A beautiful creation from Chloe. Although I am not an ardent devotee of jasmin this is an exquisitely light and fresh version of this note. It surprised me pleasantly and it felt like I was walking through a Parisian garden after a light midsummer rain. It embodies the romantic, laid back-hobo style of Chloe brand, I really enjoyed testing this fragrance.",10/03/21 00:55,Salome- U.K.
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,"I love it. It’s very strong and very long lasting. It lasts more than 14 hours on me. It’s beautiful and not shrill, but I smell an awful lot of Tuberose in here! I love Tuberose so I’m happy with this perfume but be forewarned if Tuberose is not your thing! Not blind buy safe.",09/19/21 03:24,Carpe Noctem
Jasminum Sambac Chloé,I only smell wet grass. I’m so upset and disappointed. I’m glad I didn’t cave and blind buy a full bottle and instead I just went for a 5ml decant. The amount of times I put the bottle in my cart and took it out…haha. Man. This sucks. I had such high hopes.,09/09/21 14:37,twiztidladii

Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,Isn't this a limited edition from 2011 (and then replaced by Roses De Chloe in 2013)? Are we sure these reviews are about the right fragrance?,01/29/22 18:34,Calvini
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"This is extremely elegant, refined, dignified to my nose because of how the florals are balanced with the amber and the woods. The sweetness is derived only from the natural sweet of the fresh florals, no added overdone saccharine sweetness, the rose melds beautifully with the magnolia and the lily so that the scent is open and heady without being screechy, high pitched or soapy detergent like. The amber is discreet and not overbearing, adding a touch of sensual grounding without weighing down the florals and smothering them in any way, it warms the scent and keeps it from being icy cold within the floral freshness. The cedar is also restrained and serves to ground everything above without suffocating anything in a hamster cage shaving way. It gives enough complexity without covering any floral freshness. So then that is why I consider the incredible balance achieved in this particular fragrance to make it very refined and graceful and dignified. Nothing is jarring, nothing is shocking or grating or irritating even when smelling a long time through complete dry down.",03/18/21 12:16,RosaMilena
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"I love the way this fragrance lasts and projects. Ladylike, a modern rose, polished and fresh floral. Layered today by adding ROSEFIRE by Hermetica and EVELYN ROSE by Crabtree & Evelyn. Rose lover dream.",04/22/19 11:05,stephanieklein
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"It's nice and lasts about 4 hours on my skin which is good for a perfume. But it's a dead ringer for Balenciaga Florabotanica. Not Rosabotanica. Florabotanica.
I'm wearing each on a different arm and they are identical. Chloe is a bit softer. That's the only difference on me. That being said, it's a pretty green scent with the rose coming through just enough to know it's there. A good choice for Summer and muggy weather. It also fades much faster than Florabotanica which lasts 5 plus hours on me.
The verdict? I won't buy again until I can no longer find The Florabotanica. It's been discontinued and this is a very good replacement when the other is no longer available.",05/06/17 05:14,Hedonista
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"What a luscious, fresh bouquet with a hint of green in the background coming from the lovely lily-of-the-valley. This is an amazing spring scent especially on a rainy day. When I wear it, I really feel as if I had been transported to the Parisian rose gardens. Makes me feel pretty no matter what and definitely a compliment gatherer! Too bad this was a limited edition launch--the very similar-looking Roses de Chloe is more rosy, less fresh and not as fantastic.",09/26/16 19:33,chanceuxlilas
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"I have never been able to properly describe the Chloe EDP which this perfume is based upon, so excuse my lack of artistry with words. I describe this as just like the original Chloe EDP but take away some of the fruity-candy sweetness and replace it with a rose scent. The rose here is not very green, like a fresh rose, but still very identifiable as rose.",09/12/16 10:11,novembertea
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"rose rose an old rose- not complex, it's very simple and old fashioned smell - the rose in it is heavy and something that my granny would like.",08/19/14 11:43,orlowska.joanna
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,This was a beautiful rich deep rose. Very elegant and special. Pity it was limited.,06/17/14 06:04,nightcat23
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"I sprayed a generous amount of this, couldn't smell it, and sprayed a lot more, and then still couldn't smell it. I've been accused of ruining my sense of smell by all the perfums I wear. But I've sprayed the following fragrances on today and smell them loud and clear: Escada Rockn' Rio, Jil Sander Sun, and Very Irresistible. If you have the same problem with the Chloe Rose, check out my profile since I have many in-your-face roses. My favs are Montale Aoud Queen Roses, DSH American Beauty, Diptyque Eau Rose, the Rosines, Lady Vengeance ... oh and my absolute fav Guerlain Rose Barbare.",04/01/14 13:48,Capricious Capricorn
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"YES YES YES!
Every chloe perfume starts a bit old lady like smell but after half an hour ""you are transfered"" in a garden,sprintime, full of flowers the very first moments that sun starts caressing them full of humidity and liveness so divine, so ....
I am not a fun of floral perfumes but my nose tells me different when i smell those great perfumes!
The best floral perfumes in the market!....",03/19/14 13:39,aristouka
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"This is the third Chloe I own and I have to say that there is something very ""Chloe"" about this rose edition. I find it to be more on the sharp side like Chloe Eau de Chloe with the green ribbon. I also don't get much rose from it, as I think the magnolia and amber blunt it. It is a very breezy and fresh scent. Certainly nothing overtly rosy or powdery about it. I believe the cedar in it makes it smell a bit sour on my skin. This will be the perfect rose scent for those who are looking for something easy and breezy and fresh, or those who are just now exploring rose fragrances who are leery of a full blown, blousey rich rose.
Sillage is moderate.
Longevity is long lasting.",02/22/14 18:41,Plrowden
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"$59 at Marshalls for the EDP, CHLOE ROSE EDITION smells like the pretty girl at sleepaway camp, the one with the best bedding and hair. She's the girl you grew up wanting to be and the woman who you can be now. What a wonderful reminder.",02/04/14 18:55,stephanieklein
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"This one was good from what I remember, but I really prefer the new 2013/2014 version of Roses De Chloe, IMO.",01/19/14 18:43,almarie
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"I like this in the beginning: the rose is very well balanced between rose, fresh and mildly sweet. Then the rose smell almost goes away on me and I'm left with mostly fresh, which smells much like the cold freshness in Marry Me by Lanvin. I'm not a big fan, but I still like it. My boyfriend think this perfume is really nice though, and he almost never likes perfumes. To me this is like a mix between Marry Me an Aqua Allegoria Flora Rosa, which also has that tea rose, but it also has a little bit of sourness, which this doesn't have.",12/20/13 12:03,lollsazz
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"I never write reviews but I wanted to point out that this is by no means the same as the EDP in another bottle. This is a different scent that keeps a similarity to it's predecesor.
To me this is the perfected version of the EDP, less peppery, less powdery, fresher yet still classy and not a water-downed version of the original.

I found the original a bit overpowering because of its ""powdery-ness"" at times. This is what I wanted the EDP to be all along. Too bad it's not permanent. A shame.

Love it.",12/12/13 19:14,daniargie
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"This perfume is breathtaking and classic. I personally love rose, but I know that some people tend to think it's too ""old ladyish"". There is just a hint of it in this perfume which allows for it to still be light and flirty.

I'm in love. I'm so glad I got this. It's the perfect little pre college graduation present to myself :)",11/21/13 17:25,clickingpenguin
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"Chloe Rose Edition is similar to the original Chloe EDP, yet slightly different. I feel like this version really does have a bit of a heavier emphasis on the rose note. However, it has been quite a while since I have tested the original.

A soft sweet bouquet of roses is what I smell when I wear this. It is not a dark deep red rose bouquet, more like a lighter mixture or pink and yellow roses. Chloe Rose Edition is young, light hearted, and just the right amount of sophistication not to be deemed childish. It is a sweet rose, yet it manages to be fresh and clean. The amber in this version seems to be a little powdery and compliments the rose perfectly, while allowing the note to last longer on the skin. Cedar is present here but it so faint that it is almost difficult to even pick up on it. Nothing too crazy going on here, but it is pleasent and extremely easy to enjoy.

I’m really enjoying this version of Chloe, though the Intense version will always be my true love. Chloe Rose Edition is great for when I want to wear something lighter and a little more girly. The lasting power it pretty good. It does not have a heavy sillage, but it is present and is more quiet and subdued fragrance to me. I have a feeling if you have the original EDP that a person might not necessarily need this version as well. Though it you have the intense version and want something a little lighter, but is still Chloe then I recommend this. Also if you have the EDT and are looking for something heavier this is a great choice.

I might update this is I ever get around to doing a proper comparison with the original EDP. ^_^",09/20/13 09:56,yuugainotenshi
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"This is a very beautiful rose scent. I find it different from the Chloe EDP, which I did not like, and here is why. This rose edition lacks the peony and freesia notes and the litchee of the original Chloe EDP which made it a bit too sweet for me. This one, with just the rose, magnolia, amber and cedar is a lighter, fresher scent that I like very much. I wish it weren't quite so rose-centric since it does make you smell a bit like a bouquet of roses for the first 2 or 3 hours (not necessarily a bad thing) but the other notes come out to play and blend nicely after about 4 hours and it remains a gorgeous fresh ambery rose and magnolia with a soupcon of cedar for the rest of the day. Longevity of this one on my skin is very good. This fragrance lasts a good 8 hours on my skin with some sillage and a nice skin scent thereafter.

I still like the Chloe Chloe EDP Intense best of all the Chloe flankers, but this is very lovely as well.",08/16/13 09:02,rickyrebarco

Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"At last I was able to get a bottle of Chloe Rose Edition. I am not disappointed at all.
Rose and Magnolia... Magnolia being one of my favorite flowers. I think that rose edition suits me much better than the original Chloe EDP. On my skin Chloe EDP develops a metallic note which highly annoys me. It might be litchi, because I noticed this happened with several fragrances containing litchi.
But Chloe Rose Edition is absolutely perfect. It's an everyday fresh, elegant and easy-to-wear fragrance.
I think it shares similarities with my beloved Florabotanica, though the latter is a much spicier and original thanks to carnation and mint.
Anyway sometimes despised flankers reveal much better than their originals... that's just my humble opinion of course!",11/16/12 11:12,laetitiavp

I have a mini Chloe EDP and I think it doesn't work with my chemistry, it becomes sharp and generic on my skin and sometimes it gives me a headache. Therefore, all I have to say is that if reformulation is needed, then it must be done properly-a change in the concentration of the initial ingredients is the first thing that has to be done.
This one has the same intensity and the same feeling as the Chloe EDP. Too bad !",12/28/11 02:49,CHOCAHOLIC
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"The Rose edition is the EDP, so the reviewers who say this is a different scent maybe are familiar with the EDT? To my nose, the EDP and EDT are distinctly different.

Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,This version is still quite sophisticated but also really creamy and a tad soapy. I can imagine in a hot country it would become cloying so I would keep this one for the cooler months. Its pretty but I'm im just not a fan of magnolia in anything - maybe that's what puts me off. A well made fragrance but not for me! :),11/08/11 08:39,Livvy111

Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"Chloe Rose Edition smells rather similar to the original Chloe. I was a bit disappointed at first to be completely honest. I guess I expected something more rosy and fresh rather than soapy and strong.

I wasn't a fan of the original Chloe, so I'm finding it difficult to enjoy this flanker. The roses are of course more pronounced in this fragrance, however I tend to smell a lot of peony and freesia too. It smells too much like stuffy floral-scented soaps for my liking.

As a child I used to use a rose-scented talcum powder after my baths, and in some ways Chloe Rose Edition reminds me of that smell. It's not a cringe-worthy scent, but to my nose it comes across as being dusty and ancient. It's what I'd imagine a period-style house smelling like.

I prefer roses when they're more jammy and concentrated; not so clean and pristine. However I have no doubt that this fragrance will have many fans, as many as the original has. Chloe Rose Edition is just not for me.

The longevity was impressive, and the sillage somewhere between cloying and being acceptable. It's a pretty straight-forward scent, so I'd advise only to approach if you liked the original 2008 release of Chloe EDP.",09/03/11 23:42,missk
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,There is something quite sweet about this version of Chloe. Although everything pretty much lines up with the Original Eau De Parfum- from the First initial burst of rose to the sweet and faint drydown but there is a sweetness about this scent that makes it quite innocent and feel like its quite young in a sense and i say that because when I smell this I think of innocent girls running through fields of flowers and getting their white cotton dresses dirty. I like the earthy element of this edition although it is essentially the Original scent with a new pretty bow. But I couldnt resist purchasing this edition of Chloe.

Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"This version of Chloe is pretty close to the original, it just seemed a tad fresher and more likely to catch the heart of those who didn't fall for Chloe and the intense EDP. Or is this the placebo effect of the pink bow? I usually stray from scents that showcase the rose, but this is actually a very tender wet type of rose surrounded by other buds here and there. The opening is fresh and juicy, I believe there must be some red fruit involved. The middle is deeper, flowery and rosey. I'm amazed by how amber stood out on my skin towards the drydown, but thats what happens when I wear the original. It really adds some serious depth to the scent and rounds out the watery feeling of the floral mid-stage. The aquatic notes are bordering an artificial feeling, but it's barely detectable. This is a potent perfume and the lasting power is very good.I'm starting to like it a lot, because it doesn't have this melancholic vibe of the original version, which I love. A very cheerful fragrance.",04/10/11 04:42,LuluCoconut
Chloé Rose Edition Chloé,"For me, the original EDP and EDT were rosy enough as is. The beauty of these fragrances was exactly in the un-mundane interpretation and framing of the rose element. Here, in the new 'rose' version, you can definitely feel the added rose, but it's a straighforward rose scent that I think just simplifies the entire fragrance and takes away everything we love about this line of Chloe. I just can't get why they decided to go and ruin a what was already a great thing. Dissappointing!",04/01/11 02:18,Aroussa

So I eagerly sprayed some on my wrist, thinking ""Yay! Another Chloe to love!!"".

Orchidée de Minuit Chloé,"Orchidee de Minuit by Chloe is what I call a masterfully executed, mass appealing and super likeable warm, ambery, vanilla based perfume with floral, boozy and patchouli nuances. It’s nothing special as far as the notes listed are, but the scent smells super appealing and addictive. It’s very designer like, nothing in it that makes me think it’s worth the price, performance including, but I find it so elegant and beautiful that I would consider buying it.

It has something very catchy and interesting in the way it has been composed, that I find very beautiful and classy.

Despite being nothing new, it has that addictive smell that I find myself drawn to. There are some perfumes that are nothing groundbreaking but smell so good to me that I can’t stop thinking about them. Orchidee de Minuit falls in this category!

100% a feminine scent. All ages appropriate, excluding teens because of its price, don’t think many could afford to buy it. Dumb reach type of perfume that feels appropriate for most occasions.",04/26/25 06:07,Maya lilac

Orchidée de Minuit Chloé,"Midnight velvet, heavy with secrets, has unfurled with a rich swirl of dark rum and balsamic sweetness. It clings to the air—to The Tendril of your being—like candle wax dripping down its candelabra, dense and unwavering. The vanilla, if you can even call it that, pulsing beneath it all (and there is no better word to describe this than ALL) is thick and heady, unyielding and sultry, in an almost animal-like carnality. This is what I imagine dark room full of whispered confessions would smell like—feel like. Like a weight that lingers long after it’s gone, like a depth perhaps a sliver intoxicating, but in the way spirits are to an alcohol intolerant. Too bold, too heavy, too much. For me, this midnight bloom is more a shadow I’d rather leave behind, fearful of its tendencies to suffocate and veil.",01/07/25 05:31,luvoxlixir

Orchidée de Minuit Chloé,"A ravishing ambery vanilla, Orchidée de Minuit cocoons you in gauzy layers of spice with a delicate floral undertone. It is translucent and warm, threaded through with tantalizing cloves (and a hint of nutmeg) against a backdrop of rum poured over a creamy vanilla. Vanilla pulls dark and languid on my skin, its piquant sweetness reminding me of French custard but with a sheer ambery glaze, like a mix of eclairs and creme brûlée, the gourmand tones offset by the smoky ambered patchouli.

The orchid brings a velveteen floral dimension, its balmy aroma a fantasy of plush, enveloping notes. It softens the styrax, benzoin and vanilla accord, lending the scent a suave, powdery texture. It also sets off the mysterious, carnal darkness of the base, making the flambéed quality of the ambery and woody notes come through in all their glory. The rum is present throughout, adding a voluptuous boozy nuance, which, to me, reminds of the boozy notes in my other date night staple—Voyage A Paris.

To me, Orchidée de Minuit is the ideal Friday night fume—voluptuous, sultry and ever so tempting. And while not exactly a powerhouse, it creates a diffuse cloud of scent, cloaking you in the most delicious aroma that lingers for the entirety of the night.",08/23/24 21:08,MyMuse

This was a blind buy but I don't regret it. I realize rose and leather aren't a big part of the composition but it's almost all I get!

It was quite bitter when I first sprayed it. I don't find it subtle! I find it to evoke a dominant and perhaps somewhat standoffish femininity. I want to wear it when it is bitterly cold - in the heat it would be too suffocating. After a few hours on my skin, it loses a great deal of its bitter edge and becomes a more inviting floral. There is just a hint of warm spiciness that comes out under the flowers, which is a lovely sensation. It hasn't lost its potency and it definitely won't let me forget that I'm wearing it.

Not many new launches with this note. I keep my eye out on EVERYTHING new with Gardenias.

Opens very fresh, as if there were some citrus or abstract 'apple blossoms' in it (however, there isn't), transforms into something in the likes of Chloe, Love Story for a while and then goes straight into creamy, massive, gardenia with heavy, smooth, velvety petals. Gorgeuous. This creamy, beautiful gardenia reminds me of the very drydowon of Marc Jacobs Woman or Collection Extraordinaire Gardenia Petale from Van Cleef & Arpels.

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,I absolutely love this one. I get compliments on it all the time. I find this very unisex especially with that mossy undertone. It’s different and that’s why i love it. Addicting fragrance,07/06/25 08:15,Rehderja
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I find this one to be so strange... but I like it...

I like the way it smells on the dabber, but not fond of it on my skin until it has dried down about 2-3 hours. It definitely has that curry/potpurri smell, which adds a warmth in the opening. I can pick up that sweet mirabel plum in the dry down. It's well balanced with just the right amount of sweetness from the mirabel plum in the dry down and is reminiscent of shaving cream, which I really like, but also quite odd. But I'm not crazy about the initial spray. Though odd, I'm holding onto it a bit longer because I find myself wanting to smell this profile every once in a while. It's woody, aromatic, earthy, sweet, and... fresh? I would have to agree that it is a modern take on a chypre. Need some more time with this one

Update: Got some more time with this and now I love it. Grew to love and will need to be purchasing a bigger bottle since it has been discontinued.",06/25/25 09:57,varahsue
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"A sort of nectar-Chypre. It's a very soothing and grounding profile with some depth and density that feels intoxicating.

Looking at the notes I can see how. The oil is very, very nice and strong enough to fumigate a stadium three counties over so literally the tiniest tiny drop on each wrist. It’s called Noor Al Shams by Afnan. Of course I wouldn’t bother writing a review on the wrong perfume except I see it mentioned this one is being discontinued so it might be a nice alternative.

It's unique compared to other female mainstream fragrances. It has a grounding effect without being overwhelming aromatic nor sharp.Whenever I put it, I feel a ZEN-like state as if I am connected to the earth for some reason. I wear it for that state of being rather than to smell good nor for any king of attention. Simply surrounded by nature. It has Great performance too",09/22/24 14:06,basma gamal
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"The antithesis of cliché. A very interesting and unique fragrance, but in a good way ♥.

The opening is quite harsh and overwhelmingly sweet for my taste (which must be the mirabelle top note I assume). But as the scent develops, within a couple of minutes it changes into something drastically different. A perfume that is mossy, woody and green. Wonderfully fresh and forest-y. This fragrance just seems so sophisticated, but at the same time bright and not overplayed. Almost hard to describe.. The eau de parfum of Nomade seemed kind of boring to me and did not blow me away, so this was a pleasant surprise.

As could be expected from an absolu de parfum the scent is very long lasting and the sillage is quite strong (making an entire car interior smell exactly like me ahah), but to me that's a plus. Without needing to reapply it when I come home I can still smell it on my wrist. Just the wonderful version that it dries down into - delightfully balsamic and herbal with a lovely base of deep musk and sandalwood. Such interesting notes instead of the usual florals.

Very versatile, suitable for almost any occasion, even just day-to-day. Perfect for both day and night wear, just maybe not for the summer dayz. I'd say it's decently unisex, but still leans feminine, just not in the ""traditional"" sense.

I understand why it might not be some people's cup of tea, as it is a very strong perfume with a unique composition, but it's right up my alley! Why did they discontinue it...? :( My only regret is buying a 30ml, I wish I had gotten a bigger bottle...! x",09/21/24 15:30,pola.bear<3
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I understand the scent, but I hate it or maybe it’s just not for me. Too overwhelming — the sillage is crazy — and the longevity is too much to deal with. Even though it has the sweet subtlety from mirabelle (which makes the combination even worse), it leans towards masculine to my nose. I can’t think of any occasion I can wear this to. And weird enough, the perfume on my skin is super similar to Sweet Tobacco Spirits 18.21 Man Made despite their totally different notes.

It’s understandable why it is discontinued.",07/30/24 09:19,iamkinton
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"So I do like this fragrance... But the opening is a bit sharp/screechy, I think it's the musk, and maybe the Mirabelle? It's very citrusy to me in the beginning which I don't see any citrus listed. I'm not a citrus fan.

Once it chills for about 30-45 minutes I like it more. It becomes more mossy/woody, but not deeply, still bright and fresh. It's a pretty darn dry to me, with a tad bit of sweet/tart coming from the fruity aspect.

I think this was an ok blind buy for me, not something I'll reach for suuuuper often, but I could see how this could be a great signature scent for someone. Great, inoffensive scent. However, think I prefer my oakmoss and sandalwood fragrances, in a deeper, warmer, more complex way. Wish this was slightly less harsh in the opening.",07/12/24 13:02,glass___petals
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I think we are unto an era where true creativity is to be found in designer fragrances, as opposite to niche which has lost it's way.
Anywho, Chloe's nomade absolu is a pleasant surprise of NOVELTY, yes! The opening is hard to describe and I suspect it will smell wildly different to different people, to my nose it has a sparkly weird cola vibe, but not to sweet and even a bit screechy, but in a interesting way.

Finally early spring came and the magic happened. All I can smell now is oak moss and sandalwood, slight plum sweetness from the opening. This fragrance smells so natural and expensive.
It's down to earth, elegant mossy woody composition. I am loving it finally!",05/10/24 16:11,vargadorkaluca
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,Absolu LOVE 💞,05/08/24 11:04,Elyka21
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Chloe Nomade Absolu de Parfum greets its wearer with an unusual olfactory experience that closely mirrors the scent of a container of dried curry powder, sweetened slightly as if by a whisper. This distinctive opening sets a bold tone, but it's not one that everyone may appreciate.

As the fragrance unfolds, it veers away from its initial piquancy into a more subdued realm of soft woods and plush florals. While this evolution presents a journey from the exotic to the familiar, the transition might feel abrupt or disjointed for those used to more harmonious or traditional scents.

Nomade Absolu certainly makes a statement and could be appealing for someone seeking something out of the ordinary. However, its unique profile—from spicy beginnings to a mellowed dry down—suggests that it's a fragrance to be tested thoroughly before committing to a full bottle. Suitable for cooler days or evening wear, this perfume is a venture into a world of bold contrasts and unexpected turns that might not suit every palate.

Before adding it to your collection, consider whether its journey aligns with your olfactory desires. Chloe Nomade Absolu is not just a fragrance; it's an experience, one that might be too adventurous for some.",05/07/24 12:56,Krabapple Pie

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I smell a strong aromatic scent at the very beginning (bay leaf?) and then we arrive in an undergrowth where there would have been a violent downpour a few minutes earlier. Smells of moss and damp earth rise up from the ground through evaporation and there's a mirabelle plum tree in front of us, with ripe, tart fruit hanging from it and some that would have fallen to the ground during the downpour and already started to ferment.

Finishes several hours later with a very soft oakmoss and a traces of mirabelle plums that have become syrupy, giving a very warm rendering to the whole.

Perfectly unisex.

Obviously, I ordered a bottle while it was still available as it has been officially discontinued recently 🙁

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"My favorite fragrance in my entire collection of over two hundred perfumes. Chloe Nomade Absolu does something no other fragrance has been able to capture IMO....a modern chypre. Between the Mirabelle plum and the moss accords, I am in perfume heaven. Mirabelle plum is such an underrated gem of a note and it lends a sweetness to this Absolu version that it doesn't in the other flankers and OG. The moss gives it an earthiness yet it is still very much a feminine fragrance, in my opinion, just not feminine in the traditional sense of florals and fruity banality. This is anything but that. It's complex and sophisticated, it projects and envelops anyone within a couple feet radius with a beautiful and unique aroma. It is divine. Truly, divine. I have purchased my second bottle of this gem and, while I own all the other flankers and the OG Chloe Nomade, this Absolu version stands out on its own, bold and proud, confident and daring, sexy and alluring. I cannot get enough of this gem.",03/25/24 01:12,Thegrimmreaderr

Seems to turn sour on the skin. long as it stays on the clothing. it's not horrible but it's still not great..",02/06/24 18:06,MCW7
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,The opening is tart / tangy with the fruit - not my favorite kind of accord. In the background is a nice subtle smell like being on a coniferous woodland hike. On the dry down the fruitiness is more subdued and the musk amplifies. I like the dry down it's smoother and more balanced than the opening and I see the perfume being versatile for most occasions. Overall it's relatively sophisticated and unique for a designer fruity perfume but I think it's somewhat lacking in depth. I've been on the fence about buying it for a while now but ultimately it's a like not a love. That said this is my favorite of the Nomade line.,02/01/24 16:08,chanelnumerocinq
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Christmas trees and sweet fresh plums. Great holiday fragrance but isn’t so specific that it can’t be worn at other times. But that davana really does smell like fresh evergreens!

I too ignored this line and most Chloe scents because I never hear anyone talking about them. I also am not typically into these nomads kind of scents/notes, so I never would have ventured into this line. But I’ve become an Uber fan of Quentin Bisch as his scents work with my chemistry in a way no others do, and was so surprised and impressed by the OG Nomade EDP, I had to add this and the EDT to my collection. I’d say I prefer this to the EDT currently, but the EDP is my fav.

The conifer tree note mellows out after 30min or so and the scent turns more into a gentle fruity top with a gentle fresh mossy base and slightly piney nuances. I think this is slightly more feminine leaning unisex after the Christmas tree opening, though anyone can wear whatever scent they’d like and I certainly wouldn’t think “girl perfume” if I smelled it on men.

This isn’t the strong overpowering scent some describe it as. It’s quite mellow, without feeling watered down or like it fades too fast. I initially lightly sprayed, only to come back 30 min later to finish my “normal” perfume application. It’s noticeable because it’s different, but not because it’s cloying or obnoxious. I also hoped for a touch of cinnamon or spice based on a review here but definitely no cinnamon, or any other spices as far as I can tell.

Fresh evergreen forest vibes with a delicate feminine fruity sweetness, though no review or description can do justice to this unique little treasure.

Side note-if this is what Chinese grandmas smell like, than they must be the best smelling grandmas in the world, lol. This has zero notes that make me think of any grandma scent I’ve encountered in the U.S.

Update: this is my wintertime workout scent. It’s nice and fresh and outdoorsy in the crispy cool desert winter air. A great scent for exercise and adventuring when you don’t want anything that can turn sour after hours of mixing with sweat! I hate many typical fruity body spray type scents and have been looking for something fresh and different to wear during cooler temps when Monoi/coconut white floral frags feel out of place. This scratches that itch for me.

The original EDP is still my favorite after many wears of it and the flankers.

Also, I read a fragrantica article reviewing the Nomade flankers that called Absolu the classiest due to a leather accord. I don’t see leather listed here nor have I ever gotten leather from this scent at all, thankfully, I don’t think I’d find leather to be complimentary in this blend as it would take it out of “freshie” territory and would definitely be challenging to wear when I’m running around in the sun for hours at a time.",12/29/23 08:58,wondervalley666
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,I just sprayed this and the first thing I thought of that I now can’t unsmell is those sweet Chinese preserved plum candies my grandma used to have (in a blue and white wrapper). It doesn’t smell bad per se but it’s not what I was expecting based on the notes and reviews (blind bought btw). It’s a very weird association to have with a fragrance. That’s all I smell from opening-mid-end. I would not recommend for that reason alone but will let it sit and revisit with an update if that changes. Performance seems pretty good so no complaints there.,12/20/23 20:29,Shanty36
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Somehow I ignored the Chloe Nomade range for years. Not on purpose, I just didn't hear much about it, and the notes didn't appeal to me (in theory).
About two weeks ago, the shops were very busy, I was dodging people left and right, and ended up in front of the Nomade tester bottles. The first one I sprayed was Absolu. And wow! What a nice surprise! I find it is quite unique for a designer fragrance. The fruity mirabelle plum note is light but prominent, not sticky, and the moss + sandalwood give a beautiful body to the fragrance. I'm not entirely sure how davana smells, but it seems to give a nice touch of greenness to the fragrance, which adds to it feeling unique. Definitely gives forest fairy vibes , as mentioned in other comments.

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I (blind) bought a 50ml bottle of this, because the plethora of reviews I’ve read and watched made it seem as if it was the “fall/winter” version of the original, which I loooove. However, I’m not loving it, but for $55, it was a steal. I think it’s the Davana I dislike, and I miss the really fruity opening of the OG. Is there a fragrance someone could think of to layer on top of this to give the fruity opening of the OG?

Edit: The opening smells very similar to Fireball Whiskey to me. Maybe I should let it sit for awhile?",10/23/23 07:05,GladToBeUnhappy4
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Mirabelle opening is not bright and cheerful like in EDP. This is deep and heavy but not dark. It smells like chinese dried plums - Chen Pi Mei. IOW, it smells like a chinese grandma. It smells a little bit like rice too. Haha. All kidding aside, this is for a way more mature audience than the EDP.

So who is this for? If Nomade EDP is for the 20-40 something who's into boho chic, Nomade Absolu is for the real deal.

This is for the woman who grew up in the 60's and was actually part of the hippie movement, She attended Woodstock '69 and protested against the Vietnam War. She did her pilgrimage to India, following in the footsteps of John & Yoko, and once lived in Cambodia. She grew out of it as she grew older and got a corporate job. She made her money, moved to the suburbs and raised a family.

That said, deep down, she is still that radical, free-spirited bohemian girl all those years ago. That never went away.

Its sophisticated, unique, clean/musky, sexy - something I think would work well as an all year round signature scent. I had no clue what oakmoss smelled like before purchasing, but if that's the dominant note my in the scent I can't wait to smell some of the other flankers in this line.",06/01/23 12:23,ravenhera7
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Flawless. it has everything I love about the original intensified. A home run for me, and it does indeed wear well in warm (but not necessarily hot) weather. I’m surprised by the number of people who dislike this, I surely get the intense earthiness/mossiness but that’s exactly what I love about it. The mirabelle brings round sweetness and depth to the earthiness to me, and it’s blended so well. This is a confidence boost in a bottle. Along with a couple from the Idôle range, I reach for this when I have an interview or a presentation so that I can feel unstoppable.",05/24/23 20:49,PlanetGrl
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I love the original Nomade, but the ""absolu"" version is an absolute abomination. I can't get past the Mirabelle Plum in this version. To me, it doesn't smell juicy at all. It smells like oozing overripe plums that have fallen off the tree in heaps and then baked in the sun for days. It's a sticky, sour, dried fruit smell.

For a chypre, this is a strong, long-lasting perfume. So if you are lucky enough to love this fragrance, it's a great value. However, for me, I tried it on a couple different days and had to scrub it off both times after a couple hours. I kept catching little whiffs of that weird raisin note and I find it repulsive.",05/23/23 22:09,Hartsy3
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I find this juicy and earthy. An easy, year round yet interesting fragrance. Femme leaning unisex. I get a phantom pine vibe like I do with Dior’s Rouge Trafalgar. I had underestimated this fragrance initially, I’m glad I revisited with a blind buy- my favorite way of discovering fragrances.",05/16/23 18:18,Violinplayah
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Summer is here. A deep Plum, sweet, smooth, creamy , musky, mossy which stops it being the run of the mill. If you want something different try this. Defo unisex . I get 5/6 hours . Nice arms length trail.",05/12/23 09:41,Miss Dolittle
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Man this is addictive and fun to wear. This fragrance takes me on an exotic journey beginning with sweet plum, morphing into an herbal fresh experience (with some patchouli) and settling down into some delicious sandalwood - I feel like I am enjoying a luxury day at a fancy spa. Its long lasting and strong and you might want to spray lightly to really get the best wearing experience. Great perfume.",04/24/23 07:36,honeybunny1977
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This was a sucessful blind buy! I struggle to find a summer scent that I like since I am drawn to strong, woody intense scents. After wearing this for a week I've got a solid opinion of how this fragrance smells on me, and firstly I have to say that I've always paired it with the body lotion which might affect the longevity and intensity of the perfume.. Well it is simply stunning, sexy, easy and unique and every time I bring my arm to my nose I smell something different, it's sweet but not marshmallowy sweet, it's more fruity natural sweet. It truly reminds me of a sexy gypsy riding a wild horse, kind of musky and extremely sensual without trying too hard and appropriate for any occasion. I'm addicted and can smell it all day",04/18/23 12:27,YenSung

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I've been wearing this for a while now and on two different occasions, a woman asked me if I was wearing Eros (for men). Both of them told me my cologne smelled good. I don't think this smells anything like Eros, but I'll take the compliment anyway. Both of them were surprised when I told them it was perfume by Chloe. Like the reviewer below, I find Nomade Absolu kind of exotic...a little mysterious. I think it's very warm and fruity, but not the kind of warm that wouldn't smell good in warm weather. The fruit here is more sour than sweet, which is different. The longer it wears, the smoother it gets. This makes me think of a sunny, warm, faraway place, but I like wearing this any time of day. I find this suitable for anyone, anytime, anywhere. As a man, I enjoy wearing this. It's dreamy and bewitching and I love it.",04/17/23 19:14,dogmeat

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This is one of the most beautiful fragrances out there. There’s something about it that makes it feel so nostalgic, sophisticated and mysterious. When I wear this, I feel like I am automatically taken to a forest after it’s just rained. It’s not too cold, but not too hot and you can smell the wood from the trees and leaves mixed with the pine and flowers and any other scent that’s usually in the forest. The dry down is where the magic happens. On my skin, it dries down to this beautiful creamy scent that I can’t even describe. It lasts forever on my skin… and on my clothes- I have a cardigan that I sprayed back in December, and it hasn’t been washed. It still smells of the beautiful fragrance. Please don’t ever discontinue this perfume. This is my ultimate signature scent. Thank you Chloe.",03/11/23 20:58,MarieModica88
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I think that the whole Nomade line of Chloe is some of the best ever created in perfume industry. Not only scent-wise, but also when it comes to the bottle design and overall aesthetics. I have used both the original and Naturelle for a while (and even got back up bottles), and now also got the Absolue. Love them all equally.

While the original is crisp, clean and energizing, the Absolue is warmer, rounder, softer, sweeter and a tiny bit oriental. I find it strange that no one has mentioned cinnamon yet, because I definitely detect that in Absolue.

I have not tested it for an entire day yet, so would have to come back, but so far it is really appealing to my senses.",03/10/23 07:42,Katrin77
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"A lovely addition to the Nomade family, I really like this. Sour, tart plum and smoky, earthy davana and oak moss. Lasts for hours and hours. I applied it at 8.30am and by 16.30 I could still smell it, catching wafts throughout the day. I have a small sample vial and sprayed each side of the neck and each wrist. Conservative sprays too due to the size of the atomizer. This is a versatile perfume and could be appropriate for almost any occasion or season, with the possible exception of Summer. So far the only member of the Nomade family I haven't liked is Naturelle, which has nothing in common with the others in my view and shouldn't be a Nomade flanker.",03/03/23 11:17,LMD
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"IN A NUTSHELL: Mossy, fresh plum, musk, expensive hotel in the tropics, spice rack, department store, classic, sophisticated, mature hot rich bitch :)

Slightly sweet plum with a hefty dose of musky ""classic feminine leaning, ladylike perfume"" from the initial blast!

Let it settle in for a minute, and you will be met with a cozy, warm bed of oakmoss and a very subtle woodniess. Aromatic, ever so slightly green musky goodness will soon follow!

The sweetness of the plum (mirabelle, says the oh so mighty scent pyramid!) isn't sweet or overdone to where you don't get any of that comforting earthiness that is the oakmoss - they're blended so well!

1-5 min into drydown: Slightly sweet plumy wine notes aren't hitting you in the face anymore (they were never aggressive and cloying like a dessert wine from the get go, but i feel its worth mentioning). There is a twinkling of soft green spiciness! Something like a soft, gentle mango and a hint of fresh greenery are tucked away in the backround. You do really have to get lost in the scent to pick up these nuances - this is just what my nose told me :)

* Side note * : I'm getting reminded of With Love by Hillary Duff, but without the slightly rancid mangosteen/tropical fruit smell mine has from being an older formulation - so that's a huge win!

40 min - 1hr + into drydown: Warm, cocooning, sophisticated sweet moss dusted in sandalwood!

4 sprays on clean, moisturized skin

Longevity: Moderate/average - I can get 3-4 hours of solid wear - have not tested for an entire day
Projection: Can smell at an arms length the first hour
Sillage: Leaves a nice scent trail due to its musky ""perfumey"" nature

To summarize: If you like plum, oakmoss, and classic""perfumey"" scents, this is your gal!",02/28/23 23:02,ShelbyKB
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Very relaxing top note from slightly sweet ripe mirabelle. It makes you feel so vintage and feminine, like you are on a picnic at your backyard in the 90s.
When developed, it doesnt give you any ""bad mossy"" smell like many people are afraid of. It blends very well from the fruity note to a woody earthy notes.
Perfect for a fall/winter or even a spring date night.
Fit more with mature ladies.",02/23/23 19:19,anntdangg
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This is really nice and a bit different from the usual fragrances that abound these days. It’s woody, mossy and herby, with no floral notes at all. I really like it, apart from the fact it’s not long lasting.",02/06/23 03:43,Gyps
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Salt, salt, rose, and salt again! I don't understand how there is no salt in the notes of this perfume, I smelled a surprisingly clear salt on my skin!

It's a rose and moss perfume to me, but it's like you came out of the sea and sprayed a Chloé signature-based perfume on you. I think they have a similar dna (don't get me wrong they are very different actually, but you can sense ""this is something from Chloé"").

I think this is a definitely summer scent. Not because it is fresh or light, but because of the sea-salt feeling. It made me miss summer night outs! Still, I would not consider buying this fragrance. It's a nice scent, but the kind you can smell when you walk into a perfumery or a store. I feel as if I smell this scent in a store I went to before.

Hereby, it's nice, summer evenings and sea-salt aura, longevity and sillage are really good, really feminine like other Chloé fragrances, other than that it's not very special or groundbreaking.",01/23/23 13:59,begim
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Yes, absolute yes! Very beautiful scent! I am not fun of classical Nomade, but this flanker Absolue is just GREAT! There is some sweetness here, something that was not enough for me in classical Nomade.",01/23/23 11:19,grapefruit352
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,I really love this fragrance. Definitely assigned to Winter wear with the moss - I love the earthiness that the moss invokes.

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"It was a blind buy, but I am so glad I took the leap of faith with this one. It's confident, firey, with a dash of sweet and musky all around.

At first you get crisp sweet and soury ripe mirabellas, which remind me of all the summers I used to spend at my grandparents' house at the countryside. I used to pick up mirabellas from the ground for my grandma and it smells just like that: hot dry soil and very ripe, warm mirabellas.

Then the dry down is absolutely divine on me. It smells like a night spent in the dessert, when the sun comes down and there is hot sand, a fire cracking, warm delicious fruits and spices dancing in the air.

I was looking for a more firey and feminine version for Noir by Tom Ford, which I adore, and I finally found it. This feels and smells like signature for me. For sure.",12/03/22 01:03,rencatos
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I bought a travel size of Nomade Absolu after knowing that this perfume is mossy, woody and earthy. I bought it this summer, so frankly, at the first try, I didn’t like it much. I thought this perfume is a bit old for me (I’m 26), but also thought I may like it in the future. Sometimes I open the cap of the spray bottle and a strong musky smell make me more sure about that opinion. But then, I tried it again in cool weather, and I have to say, my mind changed, I LOVE IT!

I love the top notes with a fresh and juicy tone rising in the earthy, woody base, the dark sweet oakmoss make me smile everytime my nose suddenly smell it in the air. This perfume is bold but not overwhelming, it’s showing a dark elegant vibe with full of deep and rich notes. The colder the weather is, the more I find myself enjoying this scent!

Still love it when using alone, but I like mixing it with other perfumes, too. I tried blend it with the Clementine California once and they mixed quite interesting with some youthful notes, and I think it’d be nice to blend it with something with minty taste, gonna try it later!",11/24/22 01:44,Chimyens
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I don’t know what it is with this perfume. I don’t like it! It didn’t “do anything wrong” and it doesn’t smell bad. It makes me feel sick and that’s more of my own problem. The Mirabelle plum on top is bright and almost citrusy - and mix that in with the earthy, mossy base, they just don’t work. I would almost prefer that base with something a little sweeter up top, like black currant or vanilla.",11/24/22 01:41,amg7613
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Layer this with Imaginary Authors Whiff of a Waffle cone and prepare for the tsunami of compliments.

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Can you think of a smell that takes you back to a certain point in time?
I'm sitting on a plaid picnic blanket on the wild green-covered meadow, heavy stuffy warmth of the day just meets the fresh air, while the sun sets.
The opening is a pretty, feminine and relaxed.
Not very fussy as the fragrance progresses either, the notes remain constant.

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This one is very good. It works on my skin, that is to say that it lingers and has projection. A friend of mine noticed the scent, and said that it has a smoothness that cuts the notes that show more, which are the oakmoss(more dominating) and the davana. It's mossy and woody, yes, so, it has that unisex vibe. It's mature but classy. The following day i could still caught a whiff off of my pulse.",10/25/22 10:26,Lolafraglover
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,Wow I'm shocked! I sprayed this on a blotter not thinking to much of it and tossing it in my bag. The next day i smelled the blotter again and this dry down totally smells like my ex boyfriend wearing Essenza di Zegna by Ermenegildo Zegna. He was a smoker and would smoke cigarettes and burn incense in his room as well so maybe that's contributing as well. Since the Zegna is a discontinued fragrance I cannot really compare them right now. Does anyone else have the same association?,10/19/22 03:48,Baby_becca
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This is one i really like, for the short period of time i can smell it. I think i am anosmic to it and never even get to the dry drown bc i cant smell it that long. But i do love the non-sweet earthiness, very salt of the earth, very dry, very natural/organic.
Update: i did a full day test of this today. I love the scent but i really think it wears away quite fast, i dont think it is my nose. I think on clothes it lasts a bit longer, but for an absolue i would expect far stronger projection and longevity. Ashame bc the scent itself is phenomenal.",10/09/22 10:47,AuthenticAF

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"One of the most beautiful perfumes I have ever smelled, reviews saying that it smells like an enchanted forest are spot on, it's like if dark green color was a scent... Very unique. Be aware that it's not a safe blind buy as it leans unisex.

People complaining about sillage and longevity, don't be quick to declutter it. I had the same problem when I first got it, had to wait few months for it to macerate and now it performs very well, waiting was annoying but worthy.",08/29/22 11:46,Lamiawitipo

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Similar to the French liqueur Crème de Mirabelle. This is all nectary mirabelle with the other notes disappearing into the blend. Sweet but not too.

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Is it just me, or does this smell nothing like the original perfume? I feel like it goes in a very different direction, much softer, which, I suppose, shouldn’t be a problem, as it still is a beautiful smell, but also, with almost zero sillage and poor longevity. I could drench myself in this and it would still remain a skin scent. However, in youtube reviews, people say that both Nomade and Nomade Absolu have huge projection and good longevity, especially Absolu. I myself find that Nomade is medium as regards to longevity and projection, which I could not say about its flanker, which I find to be an “absolu” of practically nothing. The name usually indicates intensity, or a more potent olfactory experience. That’s not the case here. Wth? Has the world gone crazy or have I?",08/20/22 01:38,rogue_robin

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Nomade Absolu is delightful. Mirabelle adds some juiciness and a zesty touch, I can't understand how some find it masculine, maybe the drydown is more on the unisex side as it is woody, mossy, earthy and musky, some skins probably amplifies this more. As a moss perfume this is not even that deep, it's more soft and airy, the composition throughout stays sweetened by mirabelle. I don't feel much sandalwood at all, it only adds some woodiness. Very lovely, versatile, elegant and not boring. I also loved the bottle as it is so comfortable to hold and a quite nice aesthetic. +",07/26/22 13:30,violeteme

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This scent profile (mossy, earthy) is not something I normally gravitate towards but I smelled this perfume the other week and it was an instant love❣So warm, cosy and comforting, I can't get enough of it even though it is probably more fitting for fall/winter. I got a 50 ml bottle for half the price so i'm super happy!

I also got the new Nomade Naturelle and that is my favourite of the two. Just gorgeous!!",06/16/22 05:29,Ella7712
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Surprisingly, I find this to be a softer, simpler, more feminine version of the original Nomade, a floral chypre. There's no patchouli here, the mossiness is pared back a bit, the floral elements have been reduced, and it sits closer to the skin. Definitely you get a woody mossy scent, that smells rather airy, then it is sweetened up quite a bit and made very pretty with the fruit; a fruity chypre. I remember someone mentioning Christmas when speaking about this fragrance and I can't get that out of my head, the way the mirabelle interacts with the moss gives a subtle Christmas holiday feel to the fragrance. This can be worn year-round, however.

If the original turned you off because it was too unusual or too strong, definitely try this one. It's still a pretty unique fragrance, just not as earthy.",05/29/22 04:09,strongerwithglue
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Fruity, woody, rich and seductive. Love this one of Chloé. The mirabelle is beautifully done here.

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Based on reviews I read here I thought I’d like this version more than the original, but I actually like the original better, even if it is a little more floral.

All in all, bitter freshly cut grass is the first thing I can smell. I understand that davana is kinda related to wormwood and this fragrance literally smells like wormwood, but soothed and softened by plum and sandalwood.

Very natural, soft, warm scent. It smells like a picnic on a warm autumn day in the woods, sun is shining brightly, fallen leaves are lying on the heated ground, the grass around has dried up and you are eating fresh, juicy, slightly tart plums.",04/25/22 05:12,mrshnchnkm

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,This perfume smells like an early morning in a forest glade - the smell of trees and moss humid in the morning dew. I reach for this one when I’m in the mood for something fresh yet with depth. I love the fact that it has that fresh feeling without being citrusy (thus avoiding to give that “toilet cleanser” vibe). On my skin its not very sweet but it still has a roundness to it. It definitely has a unisex vibe - however it still manages to make me feel feminine - but in a Mulan or Pochahontas kinda way.,04/01/22 14:47,Emli94
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Unique. A fragrance that is recognisable and unforgettable. Not like the typical generic - smelling perfumes.

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"<3
OMG it`s totally love at first sniff. Unlike the pioneer, which I sampled years ago and skipped for ages until one random day I got under it´s spell instantly at second chance, and became my main signature scent. Absolu is certainly less fresh, more juicy and overall darker. I happily found my forest nymph fragrance. Since applying on both wrists, the earthy notes constantly rotate with the juicy mirabelle, first impressions are mossy and herbal, then sort of sweet. Totally seductive, powerful and driven by sensual feminine energy. I like the bohemian vibes of Chloe in all their crafts, big pleasure to wear their fragrances. A bit concerning of the complains about longevity and sillage (3 hours into it and still very present), if so, it's not a big deal for me to reapply during the day.",03/22/22 13:27,mothtoaflame___
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I love this. To me, the notes are exactly as described. This modern Chypre is genius, and made by Quentin Bisch, also a genius, IMO.

The plum is refreshing and to die for. Not citrus, but bright and sparkling. It’s linear for me, so I get the plum all the way through the wear. The oakmoss is lovely. I can see where people might think “masculine,” especially if they’re Chloe fans. I don’t find it masculine at all, but I also see fragrance as genderless.

It’s modern, sophisticated, youthful but not juvenile, refined, all the good adjectives. Absolutely stunning and performs extremely well. People have said this doesn’t disperse (project) like the original Nomade EDP, but I disagree. My husband entered a room and said, “Ooh! I like that one!” And I was a good 12 feet away, and this was in the dry down. (Granted, I used 6 sprays since I was at home.)

In fact, it lasted all day and into the next: about 24 hours before I showered.
Not recommended as a blind buy, simply due to people’s mixed reviews. But this is excellent.

Adding this: My mom at 75 wears this, and she smells delightful. Same as it smells on me. I love it when she wears it! It flies off of her and not in an offensive way. More like, “Damn that smells great!” And she’s the talk o’ the town at her facility. So, I’d say all ages!",03/16/22 10:46,CeeTee
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Don't be misled by the notes in this one, as I was. And definitely don't blind buy if you favour feminine, floral or powdery in your scent. Nothing like Chloe Nomade in any way - less refined, harsh and masculine. Reminiscent of Bleu de Chanel or Jaguar. Fortunately I only bought the 30ml - happy to sell if anyone would like it.",03/06/22 02:45,bevren
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This is even better than I expected-- I always liked the chypre qualities of the normal Nomade, but found the citrus notes made it too redundant to Mitsouko. Nomade Absolu is a more straightforward green fragrance, and definitely worth a try if you find white florals overwhelming. There's prominent oakmoss that's slightly vintage, but oddly it reminds me of hairspray more than a barbershop. A leafy green accord (davana) dominates, with a vague tart sweetness I tend to associate with plum in perfumes. Somewhat designer, but nonetheless unique as it lacks any floral accords. The scent is earthy, light, soft, fresh and feminine all at once. Not going to last terribly long, but it's super wearable, inoffensive, and perfect for summer.

edit to add: now that allergy season is over, I can tell this has impressive lasting power. I spray on my chest or layer it with osmanthus perfume oil, and the scent lingers till the end of a work day.",02/25/22 12:05,okamikiera
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I love this little perfume. I'm a novice at this whole perfume thing, and this is my first time (knowingly/purposely) trying a chypre. I get a lot of the pine hours later. It's more citrusy and woodsy in the beginning. One of the less sweet perfumes I have tried. To me it's unisex leaning a bit more feminine. I always loved the smell of men's cologne compared to feminine perfume so I'd reach for this as a compromise because it's still more feminine to me. The projection is great and not overpowering. I like those around me to get whiffs, but I don't like smelling like I bathed in perfume. Whoever said it's like being in a forest surrounded by freshly rained on pine trees is spot on. It's so fresh and invigorating. I feel like whoever wears this is like in boss mode when they step outside their door ready to tackle the world.",02/24/22 16:07,Stinalee201120
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I adore this just as much as the original! When I want Nomade minus the sweeter florals, I opt for Absolu!",02/17/22 16:54,CherryWilder
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"By the look of these notes on paper, it seemed like this would be more unisex. I'm actually surprised at how womanly and feminine it is!

The mirabelle plum is almost like a kumquat sort of aroma. It's tart and actually smells yellow, like you'd assume. Sometimes fruits become ambiguous, and don't smell clearly like one thing or another (I often call stuff 'cocktail fruit'), but this is is a clear plum. I appreciate that quite a lot.

The oakmoss is really green (I'm not sure what davana should smell like), but without being fusty or aged. I really, really enjoy some of these newschool oakmoss fragrances and I personally think it's an interesting development in perfumery. This bears a resemblance to La Panthere, which I love.

I actually would prefer this to have a more substantial dose of sandalwood in it's drydown. This is an odd perfume, because neither the top or base feels heavy, it's a very heart note heavy fragrance and really shines from half an hour to an hour and a half...then it fades into a very soft, green woodiness.

Overall, quite nice, and surprisingly polite! 💚💛",02/14/22 23:00,ShadowsofLight
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I REALLY like this. Almost a love, except it’s not super unique (imo). However, it is beautiful and fresh. I would be happy to smell this on anyone anytime. Great for everyday casual wear or a signature scent. Blind buy winner for me! Hooray!",02/11/22 15:14,DJoy27
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Wonderful, impactful, unique, memorable, classy and deep fragrance. I loose myself in this scent, and imagine being in an old, green forest with ancient looking, majestic trees all around me, smelling the damp forest floor and enjoying the sun coming down to the ground in beautiful, sporadic rays. Chloé Nomade Absolu, is the Nomade I will love wearing. This is sweeter and more well rounded then Nomade edp, and also more way more ""quiet"", more grounded - more Zen. And, I have to add, Nomade Absolu, to me, is more feminine then the OG. I get no aftershave feel in this one at all, as I did with the original.

Update: Alas, like with so many oher perfumes, Nomade Absolu doesn't last long on my scent absorbing, greedy skin, but the love hasn't faded. It is so unique and beautiful to me, and I am more then glad to have added this to my collection.",02/10/22 00:11,Mariamaija Amélie
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Chloe Nomade Absolu smells lovely in the air, but on my skin the opening smells like old perfume and celery. Then the old perfume smell goes away, and it smells like celery and has an odd barn-smell (not in a bad way, it just reminds me of something I've smelled on a barn before). The dry down is much better. Overall a unique fragrance that I'm happy to have. However, if I had to pick, I would go with the original Chloe Nomade...the original is brighter and stronger, but it does tend to give me a headache.",01/27/22 21:32,swimmingrose55
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Nomade Absolu de Parfum is Nomade if the ""laying on a mossy forest floor"" moniker was taking place at Midnight in Fall. It begins with citrus fruits again, but there's a darker, mustier scent in the background (I believe it's the davana, but I'm not familiar enough with it to be sure) that amps up as time goes on. This rendition I think made Nomade masculine enough to be a unisex perfume and it lasts for a bit longer than the original. I like this more, but the slight positive change between the normal Nomade and Absolu isn't enough for me to spend an extra $10 on an already expensive perfume.",01/18/22 21:17,Remmel
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I've yet to find disappointment with the house of Chloe as they've yet to make a bad perfume in my eyes. But Nomade Absolu is among one of my least favorites and this is strictly based on a personal preference level than anything objective. Absolu is a sweeter, plummier version of the original chypre fragrance. Reminds me a little bit of Feminite du Bois by Lutens with the voluptuous plum and woodsy notes. So if you like the original Nomade but wanted the fruity aspect amped up, Absolu is absolu-tely for you. I prefer the original where the bitter dryness does remind me of being in an arid desert landscape, and the green chypre notes are more prominent.",01/06/22 13:22,gourmandnotes
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This is so classy and beautiful. Very earthy, i might say, actually it kinda smells like sand. In such a good way. Extremelly appropriate for office, discreet and non offensive yet present. It's not for girls or women who want to be sexy. It's for naturally classy ladies who know how to make the most simple white shirt like the most beautiful piece of garment. I love it. I mostly reach for other fragrances in my collection (i think i'm not that classy hehe) but I used half of my bottle and will absolutely and definitely repurchase once I - definitely - finish my 75 ml bottle.

This is a love for me",12/28/21 10:49,Cherry Bloom
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I've only smelled Nomade EDP in the store once so this review is going to focus only on Nomade Absolu. This fragrance is interesting and feels out of the ordinary. When I first sprayed it I got a very strong alcoholic pine smell, but that died down after a minute. Then the mirabelle accord starts coming through and it's very plum (go figure mirabelle is a type of plum). However, I wouldn't say that it was fruity or sweet. It's more tart and keeps this perfume from becoming a boring woodsy scent. Because at its heart this perfume is a woodsy scent. When I first smelled it, I 100% thought there was going to be pine in the base notes and was surprised when it was only sandalwood and musk. I'm not too familiar with davana but maybe that's what's giving it that realistic tree scent. The mirabelle disappears after about 45 mins and the scent doesn't shift past sandalwood and oakmoss from that point forward.

I like the scent, it's very elegant and it's interesting. However, I don't think I'll buy a full bottle after I finish my decant. One thing that surprised me was its lasting power. I thought a perfume with absolu in the title would stick around for minimum 6 hours but I'm currently at the 6 hour mark and it's quickly disappearing.",12/13/21 22:14,Isawhat
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I bought a decant 10 ml and thought what not to like from Chloe. I cannot even finish it. Trying hard and hoping it transforms to some spring flowery fragrance with my skin chemistry. It surprisingly smells masculine for me. The masculine scent is present from the spritz to the end.

This must be the mirabelle or the davana. Never heard and had until now. For sure I love the oakmoss in BV Bottega Veneta. The 'nomade' associates me with word 'pomade' which really depicts how it smells to me. My imagination is dimming and .. my hope is descending..",12/04/21 05:12,faodailen
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"it’s not that it is a bad perfume… but! it does give me the impression i’m on a farm… the smell of a grain silo, hay, cows and …prunes ready to be collected for schnaps comes to mind!…and then comes the sandelwood that tries to cut the sharp edges… still smells like barn… Surely very appropriate if you live on the countryside! …or -well the name certainly makes sense- if you go backpacking…",12/04/21 04:09,Anomis_di_Fresia
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Definitely a heavier slightly sweeter version of Nomade, really nice for the fall, but I personally prefer the original and won’t repurchase this when I go through my bottle. The original lasts longer and projects more in my opinion, and it’s more versatile.",11/23/21 15:47,HoneyRum
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,Juicy rich plum in the opening. In combination with the woods and the oakmoss it feels like being in a lush forest. The perfect fall scent in my opinion but overall I prefer the EdP which is a bit brighter and more versatile. Despite this being an Absolue it projects less than the EdP. Love them both. How surprising that Chloe came up with something so clearly standing out among the usual mainstream designer fragrances. Great!,11/23/21 07:47,karinatfragrantica
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"At first was looking for Chloe Absolute 75ml, but out of stock. The SA is so kind to take out the mini travel spray and let me spray on my arm. The smell is OMG!! This is the smell I miss so much, Miss Dior Cherie 2011 formulation! The heavily orange, floral and synthetic oakmoss base. Shut up and take my money already!

For all lovers for Miss Dior Cherie 2011 formulation, go out and get this! No regrets.",11/23/21 05:26,mylancome
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,I really like Chloe Nomad EDP. I didn't like this. It seemed like a heavy chypre. And that's coming from someone who wears original Chanel Coco. I might try one spray and run through? It's like a powdery sharp green to me.,11/13/21 12:28,Miss.Tara
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"-Opens smelling way more 'heavy' and powdery than Chloe-Nomade.

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"If I'm being honest I was really hopeful about this one. I am always looking for an evergreen/pine/forest scent that’s unisex or feminine.

The first 5 minutes are fantastic! Nomad Absolu starts off very forest-like and sparkling. There's definitely an evergreen forest canopy note along with a green and sparkling burst of not-sweet fruit. *IF* it remained all throughout like the first 5 minutes I would love it. However, it doesn't stay that way at all. Within 15 minutes it becomes a barely there (I mean zero longevity and no trail whatsoever) skin scent that is mostly a subtle woody-sweetish-musk. I've tried wearing it three times now and it just loses all it's foresty edge and disappears very quickly. SAD.

I wish this didn’t fall apart and disappear. Perfumers really need to create better products that remain for a minimum of 5 hours.

Still looking for my perfect pine/evergreen/forest type of scent. I'm mostly anosmic to all things Ormonde Jayne (otherwise OJ Woman would be a contender). I love Serge Lutens Fille en Aiguilles but it's become silly expensive. I used to have SL FeA before it became an exclusive (ugly black bottle). So, still on the hunt for a feminine pine forest....",09/22/21 12:30,perfumesniffer
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This is a very significant find indeed.

I was intrigued by the mention of it being niche quality but with a designer price. I dislike designer scents - call me a snob if you like, but I was hesitant to try this.

I love the heavy weight of the bottle and the blush-tan colour of the liquid. At first spray I hated it, so feminine, so fruity, so generically designer! But, everyone around me said how good I smelt, so I needed to get rid of my designer prejudices (which must have been influencing me).

The opening is very fruity, but do try to ignore this, as it doesn’t last long. After the first 20 minutes the divine woods come through - it’s pencil shavings heaven and worth waiting for.
The more I wear it, the more I love it and this has enormous potential to become my signature, as it’s an easy, wearable everyday scent. My boyfriend even wore it for a night out with the lads and it worked on him and was not feminine.

This is the most typically feminine fragrance in my collection but it’s just borderline unisex enough for me to love it. There is a very, very slight resemblance to BR540 but this is so much better (not as common) and easier to wear.

My scent summery: wearable pencil-shavings with an exotically juicy tang, on a base of sultry and comforting musky suede and with just enough intrigue to set it apart from the designer crowd.

You just watch this become my signature.",09/16/21 09:19,PerfumedParrot
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"It smells like falling asleep with your nose next to the bark of a tree covered in lichen, in a yellow flower patch nestled in the woods.This scent could have easily been worn by my grandmother or my child years in the future. It's quite classy and a bit cold, it doesn't have any sort of bubbly or endearing quality that draws others closer but rather makes people remark that you are well put together. The citrus burst in the first few minutes is fresh and lovely but you have to get past 30seconds of a sharp alcohol, and burning detergent.

The primary scent is moss/forest floor/mulch, cool green musk with something that has a bitter bite in the background. Because it's so outdoorsy, it comes off as quite masculine, especially since the lemon-citrus burst disappears completely after the opening.
It's completely inoffensive and office-friendly, but it might be a bit much if you are too generous in hot weather.
It lasts at least 8hours with strong projection till the 6-7hr mark and becomes a skin scent about 12hrs in and doesn't change or develop much till the 8hr mark where it becomes more musky than mossy.",08/30/21 11:29,Sauten
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Just got this in the mail! Today is my second day testing.

At first, there’s a lot of something that smacks of rubbing alcohol .. more than your normal fragrance opening. That very characteristic “rubbing alcohol” smell kinda sticks around, too .. but it seems to morph into a cold, piney note that I’m guessing is the davana. Yesterday when testing, I got a lot more of the mirabelle than I do today, and I’m really missing it. That subtle, warm sweetness is so beautiful and does a lot to balance out the more masculine facets of this scent. I also get a fluffy, comforting musk. Now, as far as the oakmoss goes, it’s oddly nice. I say “oddly” because I’m learning that oakmoss can be very hematic on me (and can smell a little like a band-aid? Maybe that’s the davana…) I do still get that, but I’m trying really hard to recalibrate my olfactory associations so that I can better appreciate this fragrance and oakmoss in general .. I’m just in love with the idea of a sweeter mossy fragrance, which Nomade Absolu is not. In fact, the drydown is salty on my skin. If the mirabelle was more prominent, this would’ve been top-shelf for me.

Top three notes are moss, musk, and davana.

I remember trying this a year or two ago. I read that this was the Allure Best of Beauty pick in the “gourmand scent” category, and since I’m a gourmand LOVER, I couldn’t wait to try it. When I finally tested it, I was totally turned off and super confused .. This is not a gourmand at all. But, upon revisiting, I can appreciate it as something different in my collection. It does have that enchanting, “forest fairy” vibe that others have mentioned. I still want it to be sweeter, but I think I can mix it with something fruitier to get it there.

Fantastic longevity and good projection. Perfect for cold, grey, winter days.",08/24/21 13:39,supergirl9412
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I'm 25 years old guy. After smelling a lots of floral, fruity and sweet female fragrances, I feel like this is something unique than the rest. I never smell something like this before on anyone around me. Absolutely stunning. I feel like even men can wear it. Ladies, try it out.

My rating: 8/10.",08/20/21 10:39,NVK
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I’ve been into perfumes from the start of covid and eventually started wearing niche. Chloe Nomade absolu is 100 a niche scent, because it is an edgy, statement piece. It’s so not what I’d imagine a Chloe perfume to be. I’d say this is a very true plum fragrance that could be unisex leaning feminine. It’s not sweet tho as many others have commented. Almost a neutral plum neither sour nor sweet but just enough fruit to wet your palette. Long lasting too. I’m very impressed, I’d say this is repurchase worthy. I wouldn’t normally rebuy but it’s very versatile and rich smelling, signature worthy fragrance. Gorgeous scent. Love.",08/07/21 21:29,dearaari
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This is it! I've worn it ten minutes, now after having the bottle in its box, wondering when's the right time to try it for the very first time. This is divine! Reminds me of how perfume used to smell like. My mother must have worn Chloé in the eighties? As it dries down now it reminds me so much of when she was dressed up going to a party. But mind, this is expensive, posh, timeless, sweet, very feminine. It's a bomb of powder hidden beneath a sweet narcotic veil of flowers. Yes I get heavy dewy flowers, I get the smell of skin. An old ladys skin, oh now this sounds in reverse, perverse no? A very sweet grandmother. It's the scent of heritage. That's it. I love it! As if the nomade is the perfume being handed down generations. Now it's with me.

Signature scent worthy.
This gem gives strenght, caracter, where there is none there is none, what I mean is you can trust it to bring forth your inner self but with humbleness. Ageless.

I suggest eating something sweet before spraying, if you want to get the sweetness in it. I've been smelling the cap and the sweetness emerges and disappears depending on your palate, perhaps it has to do with the davana playing hide and seek. I'll probably update this or give a new review after loving this for a while.

If you're a Chloé lover, this is a must. It's quite rounded, well blended, a little goes a long way here. Can probably be built up for enormous sillage. I have just a tiny drop on, already craving more. But it's enough, it's night and the rain is pouring down at the moss and woods outside, how fitting.

I would wear this when I needed the best from myself, when I want to be me. Authentic. If you're an actor this could be great, any creative personality would probably gain from this.
It's grounding, potent, it dreams big. Intelligent, no doubt.
Sexy? Ah, in a way. If you are sexy, it will be. But not my first choice to seduce. It demands respect though. Hmm.
It's sensuelle.

45 minutes in I also get plum. Perhaps the mirabelle. Yes, it must be? It's mysterious. I want to spray again.

Ahh it's a dream. It reminds me of Monaco. It has that warm air with a gentlemans sillage of je ne sais quois.

I'm so grateful.",08/01/21 13:57,Eclectorina
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This fragrance really shocked me today. Great longevity as it has been 7 hours plus and I haven’t managed to scrub it off. It’s all I can smell. If you are someone like me that enjoys ultra feminine and somewhat sweet fragrances, you will probably not enjoy wearing this one. To me it has gone past unisex into very masculine territory. As outdated as the concept of feminine/masculine in perfumes may be, I feel that description still fits. Apologies if this offends anyone. In the words of Simon Cowell, it’s a NO from me. Each to their own.",07/29/21 11:40,Marisa36

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"After quite a long search, I've finally found my everyday, don't-think-about-it-just-spray work perfume in Chloe Nomade, thanks to a suggestion I received on a Fragantica forum. I tried both the regular and this absolu, and I enjoyed the deeper, woodier scents in the Absolu. If you lean sparkly and feminine, the regular might be for you; if you tend toward unisex, this one would be my recommendation. To me, Nomade is the perfect combo of modern, sandalwood-y scent mixed with classic ""perfume fo' real"" notes. Performance is good for the office - noticeable, but not offensively enormous. Would work in any season. Definitely try before you buy, but this fit exactly what I was looking for.",07/14/21 12:12,RMIC

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I just received the mini bottle of this that I sent away for and it doesn't disappoint! Rich and woodsy with a slight fruity tang, it is the perfect Autumn scent. Rich and sensual as a bonfire on an October night. Longevity and silage are totally awesome! A little on the expensive side, but this one is totally worth it! A+!!!",05/21/21 20:58,PinkRainbow
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"To me, this smells like fir or juniper trees - sweetened just a little bit by the Mirabelle. For some reason the davana comes out so strongly on my skin that I smell a little bit like a Christmas wreath, or a sweet gin (not that either is a bad thing). Totally different from anything else I own, and one that surprises me every time I wear it.
It's pretty unique, and I like that it leans a little bit outside designer territory, but it's still sweet and friendly, and so it seem like it wouldn't offend most people. Interesting enough to not be everyone's cup of tea, so I suggest testing this (it's easy to find in your neighborhood department store) before you buy it.",04/18/21 14:24,SophiaG
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Very inoffensive scent. Not challenging or striking, something serene, a little sensuous about it? It's cosy but also clean to me which I love. Leans a little bit masculine and soapy but I don't mind because I've got plenty of strong, sweet ultra-girly scents and this brings something different to my collection. I reach for this when I want to feel chic, confident, but calm and cosy. Alliteration not intended.",04/17/21 10:05,esmeralda999
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Eh...what? I keep sniffing my wrist and yes, yes, it is 1998-2000 all over again and every man smells of Hugo by Hugo Boss.
Other than the 2 minute Mirabelle in the opening note, this turns woody and metallic on my skin, and resolutely male. Not unpleasant, but not at all what I expected, and not what I like neither.
Pretty but superficial and without surprises, like my first crush back then, and like said crush dissipates pretty quickly too.
It's true that it's different from the indiscernible hordes of fruitchulies but it's not enough to make a remarkable or even note-worthy perfume.
A safe choice if you easily wear woody unisex scents, for everyone else I'd recommend a skin test before buying! Could easily be worn by a man.",04/11/21 10:47,Manya3
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"It's the best version of a designer fragrance for me. Very easy to understand and wear, nothing conceptual here. Yet, deep, rich, and luxurious smelling. Great performance, I catch the whiffs of it on myself many hours after application. I'm surprised people say it's sweet. I usually have a very low tolerance towards sweet fragrances but this one does not bother me at all. Compared to the original EDP this one is much richer and more chic. Also, it reminds me of Coco Mademoiselle, probably because they both belong to the chypre fruity family of fragrances.",04/03/21 06:24,Yana_Yana
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I love this one, I'm fighting with myself to get this mid-spring because it's pretty undeniably a fall scent (in my mind.) It's very cozy and spicy, like a spicy dessert fall candle. I feel like I smelled a slight spiciness the whole time, which is strange because it doesn't seem like there's anything listed in the notes to give than impression. The dry down really made me nostalgic and sold me on this scent. It felt sitting outside on a cooler summer night, you have a wood pile ready beside you and your favorite people are sat around a small fire. Your yard is private and nestled away in the trees. It honestly smelled really reminiscent of my grandfathers cologne, but in the best way possible. For me, this is a cozy bomb.",03/20/21 15:58,CorgRage
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I tested this one after the original perfume Nomade. As I expected, this one start with a bit of sweeter opening, but almost immediately turn into a woody scent entirely. The freshness from the original nomade is lacking and it comes heavier, more grounded woodiness. It has a bit of spiciness, it's not as fresh and airy, it's more earthy. For my taste is too woody and this is the predominant smell actually. Reminds of the perfumes of Dsquared2 which have the same realistic woodiness. Not my cup of tea, for sure. It smell less like a male fragrance, unlike the original, yet it's still unisex in my opinion. The mirabella I assume gives this slightly sweet note to it. It's not unpleasant by any means, but if you spray too many times it can easily give you headache. It's quite heavy. The juice inside is also darker, light brownish. The first one has transparent juice, if that matters. It's interesting how the initial opening was more woody, but the dry down gets a bit sweeter on my skin. It's not mind blowing, so it depends what exactly you looking for. I am tempted to say I don't dislike it, but I feel like the original has more freshness to it. Both are quite generic, nothing too unique about it. The bottle is really sophisticated and elegant, simplistic and minimalistic.",03/11/21 05:12,aeanian
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Gorgeous scent! It’s strong, aromatic, spicy, beautiful! It has a ton of character to it. It kind of reminds me of something, but I’m not sure what. Makes me feel nostalgic in a way, although it’s adventurous as well. Beautiful fragrance!",02/17/21 14:07,Aikipy
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"The smell of adventure! Or maybe I've fallen for the marketing ploys ;)

I've worn the edp in the last trips I was on pre-corona, so all of the nomads reminds me of that. Freedom!

If you are not as easily suggested as I am, then the scent itself is sweet, piney and a little fruity. I think it almost has a powdery, cosmetic vibe compared to the edp which is more fresh and sparkly. I prefer this one a little bit over the edp since I find it more feminine (because of the sweetness), but you could also argue that it is more masculine since it is definitely more woody.",01/31/21 06:03,astrakan
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Wow what a hidden gem! My husband bought me a gift set of this perfume. I read some reviews and watched some videos. The reviews were so mixed, I thought I'd hate it. On initial spray I was in love. Then on the early dry down it went a little musky, like bo. Jeez did I make a mistake? Then on the final dry down I was in love again. It's the most beautiful powdery, sandalwood, almost cashmere type scent. Absolutely lovely. I say I really like this perfume, just because the weird initial bo dry down. Just wait until it completely dries. Sheer bliss.

I also think this would be delicious layer with the perfume Sweet by Lolia Lempicka. Will try that out.",01/05/21 07:57,Scentflower
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This is so beautiful! At first I could not decide between this one and the EDP, but the big dose of oakmoss and deep forest vibes made me choose this one. Very mossy, earthy and outdoorsy, it feels kind of dry in my nose. The plum isn´t sweet or juicy, it just gives the scent that little fresh start that it needs.

I don´t know what davana smelles like, but I guess it´s the slightly bitter/herbal note that gives it a somewhat dark undertone in the drydown. Nomade Absolu is serious and a little bit gloomy. I love this perfume, but it might not be everyones cup of tea.

As for longevity - it lasts and lasts on me. Sillage is moderate.",01/05/21 04:33,Vestfjord
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Currently testing a sample I bought from a reputable seller. After having it on for only a short time, I am about to have to go scrub this off. I smell like a mossy, swampy forest. It’s very strong with one spray and I cannot stand it. It’s not feminine at all, which I typically don’t mind. I wear a lot of men’s or unisex fragrances. It just smells gross and dirty like someone who spent long periods of time in the woods without showering. It’s a no from me.",12/26/20 14:24,lavender_and_teal013
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This was a gift and I must say I really like it from the first spray. This is not usually what I would have bought for myself but I am pleasantly surprised how lovely it is. It has a soft and elegant aroma, not offensive in any way. I sprayed it at a party and everyone loved it. It could be for office or day time out and about. I'm not sure it's for date night or evenings. It does not have anything offensive about it, I would say it's a really safe blind buy. It's simple, elegant and delightful.",12/25/20 00:44,Flame Maiden
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"All I smell initially is pine, my initial thought was that this has a pine note, it's not as harsh as cedar, but in a similar vein, herbal, woody, even slightly like a very mild dusty cinnamon. In the drydown, the pine is joined by a light musk. It smells like I've been rolling around on a dry forest floor and have pine needles stuck to my skin because I've put some lightly scented moisturiser on. Not one I'd buy, but I can see why someone would love this as it does stand out in today's designer scent market. I'd like to smell this on a man!",12/11/20 10:36,qofb

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"It seems like every time I smell a new perfume these days it points me in the direction of something else already established out there. And if I actually LIKE said new perfume, my hope is that I already own the thing that it reminds me of, if only to save my poor pocketbook. Luckily, this is the case with Chloe Nomade Absolu. I have a sample from a Sephora Favorites pack, and so as I'm making my way through the offerings, I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I liked it immediately. It's rich and mossy and silky...and really Chanel-esque. At first I thought, wait... Coco Mademoiselle? But no, it's not that ""in your face"" patchouli (and CM doesn't personally work for me). No, it's definitely more of a Coco Noir. Yes, that's it! This is a bit of a more daytime version of Coco Noir. Actually it's also VERY similar to another perfume that I own, L'Erbolario Camellia. If you do not own either one of these but are in the market for a grown-up, slightly sophisticated, signature-scent worthy fragrance, this may be your winner. I'm still waiting to see if I can find another fragrance in the Sephora Favorites that might topple this one...but we'll see!",11/19/20 14:25,mychinarose
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"this is a signature scent worthy, really
it smells adoringly dreamy yet fresh, dreamy for its woody earthy notes and fresh for its florals in my opinion and i would want to wear this almost everywhere, it is such a day time wear that i don't think wearing it at night would do it justice... also i think i have not smelt this on anyone and that in itself makes it more desiring for me at least because a great signature worthy fragrance woudn't be really lingering on every skin you encounter.... (just a very odd way of seeing sign. scents ik) anyway it is beautiful and look at the bottle sucha beauty in its class. also the original nomade isn't as woody as this yet original seemed like a very sweet yet citrusy and here the notes in my opinion are more overpowering on the fruity and woody notes which is a definitely a lovely blend.",11/17/20 07:51,ayken
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"absolute, skin test, summer, also tested the edp and edt same line.

this to me is a different scent to the other two from the line. the woods?? are similar to what i get in lalique amythyst, though the mossyness of this gives a more rough feel, perhaps woody, rather than wet and dewey take (not a rough and sharp scent on a whole though)
no idea what a mirabelle is... this is sort of a fruit tea+mossy+.. now after an hour or so im getting a waft of fresh through the layers, its more rounded than the edp, but still a moss+wood+fruit scent, though thicker than the other two, more rounded as ive said already, it could contain a take on dark berry also, the fruit aspect isnt straight citrus...
decent sillage for me",11/15/20 15:52,dglightblue

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I am a huge fan of the original Nomade, and a big fan of chypres in general. I've often wished that I could smell the oakmoss just a touch more in the original Nomade. In this Absolu, it seems they've given me what I want...annnnnd I don't like it.

Nomade Absolu is missing the sparkle I get from the original. One of my favorite things about chypres is the contrast between the bright, citrusy tops and the earthy bases, and I'm not getting that here. Instead, I'm getting only the earthy base. Perhaps this particular fragrance was pared down a bit too much for me to enjoy?

Absolu is significantly less fruity, and the oakmoss and sandalwood are strong. The end result is a fragrance with a decidedly masculine energy on my skin; it's a smell that reminds me of an old fashioned men's shaving cream. I'm not sure if I can even smell the plum, though to be fair, I don't know exactly what a mirabelle plum is supposed to smell like. They could smell like men's shaving cream for all I know!

One thing I will say is that the longevity is solid. In fact, I would say it's downright tenacious. I've washed the hand I sprayed it on a couple of times and I can still smell it. So if you do like this scent, you can look forward to a nice long wear time.

I'm sure Nomade Absolu is a lot of people's cup of tea. It's just not mine.",10/24/20 15:27,catswearingperfume
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I'm not very invested in the brand Chloé and haven't tried all of their scent, but from those that I know, this is the best thing since good old Narcisse.

Like expected it's a richer, more intense version of Nomade. I already like Nomade, but compared to this beauty it smells a little boring, too fresh and fruity. Nomade Absolu amps up the chypre character in the opening and adds a warmer base. If the scent had a color, it would be dark green and warm plummy red swirled into each other. The mirabelle is really juicy and ripe, but tart and natural smelling. Not especially sweet. The oakmoss gives the scent a sharp, dark edge, similar to the effect of patchouli in many fragrances, but greener. In the drydown the scent warms up beautifully, but doesn't lose its fruity and green sparkle. I definitely smell some spiced sandalwood here. Unfortunately I don't know what davana smells like, but the fragrantica notes page says it's ""herbal green with a balsamic undertone"", which I absolutely get from this scent.

All in all this is a wonderful option for autumn and winter. I usually love oriental vanillas and gourmands for the colder seasons, but I appreciate that this is different from most modern designer fragrances and more mysterious in a way.
Also, take note if you care about sillage, this wafts around you nicely and generally performs very well.",10/23/20 07:32,SailorV
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Mmm. K. I thought I loved this after an afternoon testing n spraying perfumes all over the place at Macy's LOL but no. It was NOT this one. To me,this smells oudy, saffron, like MJ Decadence n that is even better than this n I don't like Decadence. I understand why people would like this but it's a hard no for me. Going up on Mercari.",10/20/20 04:53,Vanillastorm40
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This smells like a fancy boutique body cream. It's not exactly what I prefer in perfumes, but it's definitely pleasant and feminine.

It has a very strong creamy milky vanilla feel to it, so I'm surprised there is no vanilla in the notes. It's on the sweeter side, but the Mirabelle adds this slightly sour freshness that saves it from being completely average. It's almost juicy, and I get a bit of a pear scent, even.

Overall it's nice, but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it, as it's not exactly my style. I would maybe buy it as a gift to the more mellow and calm women in my life.",10/08/20 03:39,AlexandraTroush
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I finally got to test this yesterday and the mirabelle plum is too much for me. I personally prefer my fragrances not to be sweet or if they are then at least mellows down but the sweet plum in Nomade is tenacious. I wanted to have more of the oakmoss and sandalwood but sadly they sit quietly on my skin so this fragrance is not for me.

Just to add, I was intrigued with the Nomade line for a while now but after reading the reviews I was not really inclined to test it because I personally have a picture of what a nomad smells like and the scent pyramid of Nomade does not link with my imagination, of a wandering (dessert) nomad who smells of deep florals, green earthiness mingled with smoke and musk. Perhaps this
is Chloe's interpretation of a nomad which is more of a city nomad then a dessert one.",09/20/20 01:06,M.Golightly
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I’m currently wearing this on my left wrist and the regular EdP on my right. They are both divine but actually pretty different in mood. The Mirabelle/Oakmoss is the Common denominator, the red line your nose will follow throughout.
The thing with Davana, the little herbal gem added in the Absolut, is that it is quite the chameleon. It can do many things for different people but on me, it tends to go pine-y and woody and herbaceous. It turns this (in my opinion) simpler version of Nomade into an absolute stunner. It’s not as happy as the pillar fragrance, not as bubbly, but more serious and deep. Sally has been bringing hours and hours of rain to my door and as I’m sitting here wrapped up in my gray chenille blanket and a peppermint tea next to me, I feel like Nomade Absolut de Parfum will be my new best friend.
EDIT:
As far as longevity goes, this one sadly disappoints. I gave both fragrances 3 spritzes on my wrists and we are now at 4 hours later and Absolu has entirely disappeared. Nomade EdP is still going strong. This is super disappointing IMO.",09/17/20 05:21,aray

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I just bought it yesterday after testing in the perfumery. This is my new signature scent. It's amazing, it's perfect. A perfume with character. It smells so classy, expensive and unique, it's exactly what I was looking for.
The longevity is fantastic, I sprayed it around 1 p.m. and I could still smell it quite strong at 11 p.m.

This is not a girly, sweet, cheerful scent. It's, in my opinion, a scent for a grown, sophisticated and self-confident woman who wants to smell classy and amazing in any occasion. I don't see it as a typical sexy fragrance, it's more for the office/daily wear.

P.s. I can't stand perfumes with jasmine and those overly strong in-your-face fragrances. I was so happy to find this one, it's strong, but not a headache inducer. I highly recommend it.",09/16/20 22:29,Milena Milivojevic

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I really dislike most Chloé fragrances. I find them generic, overly sweet, and they irritate my skin. Upon reading all these articles and reviews about this most recent take on the chypre genre, I was intrigued and decided to revisit the brand.

Long story short, I liked Nomade well enough to buy it, but it doesn't read as a chypre to me. The absolu is the only concentration that has any lasting power, at least on my skin, and I did indeed find it a lot more interesting and daring than most of their other scents.

The pungency of the mirabelle plum contrasts beautifully with the bitter-mossy notes (I'm not going to risk any assessments of the davana note, as I'm not familiar with it and had trouble distinguishing it from the oakmoss) and there was just a touch of warmth from the sandalwood and musk to round out the sharp edges. There was also a nice progression from a kind of herbaceously green sweetness to an aromatic tartness; this was an unexpected surprise, as I expected Nomade to be totally linear.

I see why this could technically be a chypre, but it lacks the depth, fullness, and character that I've come to associate with that fragrance family. Perhaps my definition or understanding of the genre is too narrow, or maybe that's my love of grand, regal fragrances talking. I'm not saying that chypres can't be fun or modern (just look at something like 31 Rue Cambon or Folie Bleue), but this one is just a bit too sweet and thin for me. I see a lot of people complaining about how the oakmoss ruins this and makes it too masculine, even though that was kind of the point. To me, it's the oakmoss that actually rescues Nomade from the junk pile of so many other tired frutchoulis. If anything, they could have added more, as well as some more musks and aromatics.

As it is, though, I'm going to keep wearing this when I want something just a little different, something a bit fun and flirty but with some grounded earthiness to it as well. The name is evocative and fitting. I find this feminine-leaning-unisex, more on the casual side, better for daytime wear, relatively versatile in terms of season, and with decent longevity and projection (though perhaps not as strong as a so-called ""absolu"" should be).

Definitely worth a try!",08/26/20 22:29,jæ
Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I have never cared for Chloe simply because of their floral, classic scents. Also, I don't really like floral smells, but this one is a winner for me. I love everything about this fragrance. I love how the plum blends with the oak moss, which doesn't make it too masculine. I get floral hints in the middle, but it's not overpowering because the plum keeps coming through. The dry down is my favorite, probably because I'm a lover of woody/earthy scents. The more it stays on, the more I love it. Many people think it's too mature smelling, but I'd have to disagree on that one. Of course I don't see this on a teenager or a college student, but I can certainly smell this on someone in their late 20's and up. I think it depends on a person's style too. I smell this on someone with a more simplistic/modern style who is very care free and adventurous. There is a modern chypre to it that gives it a unique, enticing smell. The fact that I can't compare it to any other fragrance tells me how different this is. Also, the longevity is great. It stayed on me for 6+ hours and I still smell it on my clothes days later. It's an all around win for me!",08/17/20 08:03,aflakes

Nomade Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I know it's barely the beginning of March but I think it's already safe to say that Nomade Absolu is my favourite release of this year. It represents the same kind of spirit as the other fragrances of the Nomade line, but is far more mature, mysterious and sophisticated than them. It has been stripped of the sweet-sour, fruity note characteristic to the earlier releases in favour of a wonderful, green-earthy element. Nomade Absolu is undoubtedly rich on davana which I appreciate very much as a note and am happy to have found it here in abundance. Along with the oakmoss it provides an enchanting, mysterious, almost dark aura, which feels like walking in the woods full of mythical creatures at midnight during the midsummer night. The sandalwood gently softens the composition and the delicate fruity note provides just the right amount of subtle, subdued sweetness. I think this version makes an excellent unisex, it might not be a crowd pleaser but for the right person it surely could be a signature scent material. I'm absolutely in love with it.",03/01/20 08:17,Lust87

Unfortunately , the perfume I found was a soft, nondescript, fruit scent that baffled me. It was so boring and it was pretty weak . I even looked closely at the bottle to see if I had made an error in finding Nomade Absolu . I had not erred according to the label on the bottle at Sephora .

To me this perfume smells, soft, fruity , weak, and nondescript and not worthy of the retail cost that is high. I am not sure what the house was hoping to accomplish creatively with this product .

Fleur de Narcisse Chloé,"I had the original Chloe Narcisse back in high school, I wore it to my prom. So many good memories from that smell. I found a mini of Fleur de Narcisse and I'm pleased to say it's quite similar. The difference seems to be that CN is a bit thicker, heavier on the spice and fruit notes. FdN on the other hand, goes straight to the floral stage, which the original takes several hours to reach. It's still a thick sweet floral and I wish more perfumes did a narcissus (daffodil) accord, as it is so gorgeous.

Very pretty bottle as well... the sillage is excellent, you only need a tiny amount at a time. Would recommend to lovers of daffodil, mimosa and generally people who love sweet florals that are unique. I really have not smelled anything else like these two perfumes.",03/28/18 07:00,stacia79

Fleur de Narcisse Chloé,"FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

Narcisse is my signature and I've worn and adored it for 5 years, and so frequently as of late that I've unfortunately developed anosmia to it, which may affect my analysis of the fragrance.

Fleur de Narcisse is almost identical to my vintage Chloe Narcisse EDT circa the late 1990s (Parfums International), which I initially thought had turned due to the strange accord I'll describe soon. It possesses Narcisse DNA, but is far less heavy on the pitted fruits and is dominated by a bittersweet waxy accord that I can only describe as reminiscent of honeyed hay or tobacco with a slight lipstick/makeup vibe (could be marigold). My nose isn't trained enough to decipher what it is exactly and the anosmia I'm dealing with is certainly affecting the potency and my ability to discern individual notes.

I'll update this review after taking a break from Narcisse for a week or two, allowing myself to fully experience and appreciate the fragrance again. What I'll say for now is that if you're concerned with Narcisse being ""ruined"" by reformulation, don't be. It's possible my bottle was stored incorrectly, but I don't believe the vintage ages well and I find the modern formula to be much more complex, floral and potent.",02/20/18 21:25,Azula
Fleur de Narcisse Chloé,"Not a review, just an observation:

As I was searching Fragrantica for a good Narcissus perfume, I noticed that Chloe Fleur De Narcisse (1994) and L'Artisan Fleur De Narcisse (2006) are both made by Anne Flipo and have the exact same identical notes (PLUS Chloe FdN also has peach, pineapple, gardenia, carnation, and vanilla, so basically more fruit & spice.)

So if you are on a wild-unicorn hunt for either of these two discontinued lovelies, you might want to broaden your hunt to include the other one as well. They're not going to be exactly the same of course but from the looks of it, I think it's safe to assume there will be a strong similarity.

Fleur de Narcisse Chloé,"The description above is accurate- this is an almost gourmand frag. The notes, however, seem odd. I don't detect any if them!

In a side-by-side comparison between CN and CFdN, CFdN has a brief, 30 second alcohol and bitter opening, and then jumps right to peach, pineapple, apricot, with just a touch of spicy carnation and paperwhite.

CN, on the other hand, remains spicy and bitter for quite a while before drying down to the fruitier aspects. I personally prefer CN for the complexity and nuance of the scent.

But CFdN is pretty, fruity, juicy, sweet, and easy to wear. I find it very girlish, with an almost lipstick-like undertone.

Sillage for both are huge, but CN lasts much longer. I recommend CFdN for those who find the original difficult to wear, and who enjoy fruity, juicy scents. Unlike the original, CFdN seems like it would be a safe blind buy.",06/05/15 12:40,lotus and jasmine

Fleur de Narcisse Chloé,"Thanks to a fantastic swapper, I got a sample of this one-unfortunately it has no hope on my skin!

I have had a craving lately for the narcisse note in fragrances-a flower that compares to no other, and embodies a lovely bright spring season.

Unfortunately, this is syrupy sweet. Where's the narcissus? Drowned in sugar-or even saccharine! I don't really smell anything besides sweetness with a clear artificial idea of narcisse masquerading in grand sillage. Leather? Oakmoss? Iris? Wouldn't they lend more smoothness, bitterness, even soapiness, to give it some, any nuance? I am glad I don't test unfamiliar fragrances when I have to go to work-this would have been a disaster to wear out.

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"The best Nomade so far. Very feminine and quite fresh. Perfect for the signature scent. I mainly smell ginger, orange blossom and vanilla. I wish this was a little more spicy, or have some depth. Still it's a beautiful scent, perfect for a gift. Safe for a blind buy as well.",11/01/25 08:18,Igalmusic85
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I was so excited to try this after seeing the notes of myrrh, opoponax and kyphi, just to get a sample and find out it smells exactly of pastiera napoletana (a cake that uses orange blossom water, the same kind of blossom that produces neroli essential oil).
I like it, I just wasn't expecting something so gourmand-y. I'll certainly wear it around Easter!🤍🐇",11/01/25 02:42,sailorwave

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I imagine this is how an Egyptian queen would have smelled like after a bath. It’s a well-balanced scent: clean, yet spicy and sweet.

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"This is a beautiful lady-like powdery yet creamy white floral. I get some bubblegummy facets, presumably from the orange blossom but it's not too much. Nothing groundbreaking but clean-smelling and likeable, a great designer flanker. It might be a bit of a departure from the original Nomade though as it lacks the green element from the oakmoss.",10/03/25 04:26,PerfumePixie87
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"Beautiful and unique. On my last Sephora visit I tested a lot of perfumes and only this one caught my attention along with a few from Chanel. It's deep, sophisticated, sweet. Nothing in common with og Nomade. Love it and I bought my own bottle.",09/22/25 05:55,Jezebelle
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I got this for under $50 at one of the usual online resellers. Almost soapy, then you catch the warm spices and an almost nutty accord from the resins. The orange blossom stands out the most, and many hours later it’s close to the skin and smells akin to the late dry down of Love Don’t Be Shy. The push-pull of warm yet soapy is utterly intriguing yet comforting. It fits beautifully with these late summer days, where it’s cool in the morning and hot in the late afternoon. All in all, I’m obsessed!",09/15/25 05:58,Malmal8604
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"This perfume is so calming, it made its way up to my signature. It's addicting, alluring, and creamy. The cinnamon and orange blossom are perfectly balanced and sweet but in an elegant and sophisticated way.",09/12/25 20:58,stargoose

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"This scent is like a grown up version of Paco Rabanne’s Olympéa. Even if the notes on both of them aren’t exactly similar, that’s what it reminds me of. Cinnamon, orange blossom and vanilla are the most prominent notes to me in this fragrance.
I wish this lasted longer on skin, it does stick to fabrics quite well.
All things considered, this is a lovely fragrance and I will be purchasing a full bottle of it, it’s price point is fair for what it is.",08/19/25 22:39,MrsCrow
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"It’s intoxicating. Very feminine - but not in a sultry way. It’s elegant and balanced. Sweet but not sickly, mature but not oldish or dated. Captivating but not decadent or loud.",07/10/25 14:01,Sarnaidaci

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I got a tester out of curiosity and I still can't quite tell if I like this one or not. It immediately reminded me of the lemon tree my late grandmother had when I was a kid, which is why I went in and bought the whole bottle. However, there are some cons that even my nostalgia doesn't let me ignore. First of all, the opening citrus note seems a bit sharp and artificial but it dries down quickly and turns into - almost nothing? There is a barely-there sweet lemon cake scent that doesn't project much. Apparently the perfume is made with mostly natural ingredients which is great if you're into that but it could be messing with the performance. If you're looking for something bright yet discreet for those dry, hot summer days, give it a shot but don't expect a lot....",06/22/25 05:46,martian_
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"Though I loved this when I sampled it, the miniature bottle came and after 1 use I gave it away. I find it heavy, leaning toward a couple of classic Parisian perfumes that are not my thing. That said, when just the basenotes are left after 5 hours or so, It's revealing the intrinsic greatness of this scent. The soft powderyness that lingers is just sooo nice.",06/19/25 11:24,zapling
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I wish they had named this Myrrhe d'Égypte, it would have been just as fitting. Myrrh is the soul of this fragrance, spiced with cinnamon and ginger, then sweetened by amber and vanilla. I am very surprised it doesn't have dates as a note. It holds an ancient, mythic quality that makes me think of golden dunes, sunlight reflected on the Nile, Cleopatra's last moments as she held the adder to her chest. Α scent that carries the history of thousand-year empires and the queens who watched them rise and fall.",06/16/25 11:03,neth
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"it would make a really nice winter perfume. both spicy and sweet. i love the exotic character of this one and having a hard time choosing between the naturelle and this.

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"Quite similar to Libre Le Parfume, however more multidimentional.

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I was surpised by this, I thought it would smell middle easterny + orange blossomy (which i tolerate very badly) but it doesn't! Its very gentle, rich and not overpowering, and I really don't know how to explain it, the notes are confusing and mysterious to me but I can tell one thing.
THIS IS ADDICTING! the type where you keep smelling yourself addicting and wondering what is this? And why does it smell so good?
I can imagine wearing it on for night time occasionally, when its not too hot out.
I just love it and It smells so original and rich",05/13/25 00:20,Hanavanille
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"The ultra-sweet, syrupy sister of the original Nomade. While the OG bursts open with freshness and sparkle, Nuit d’Égypte leans into warmth and depth but maybe a little too hard. With notes like myrrh, cinnamon, kyphi, vanilla, and opoponax, it’s meant to feel ancient, rich, and mysterious.

But on my skin? It’s overwhelmingly sweet, almost cloying at times. That bold contrast to the original’s balanced beauty makes this one feel a little too heavy, too indulgent. I admire the concept, but in execution, it doesn’t impress me as much. The original still reigns supreme.

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I love a good vintage cosmetic aroma - there is definitely a fleeting element of that here!

For the first time in a while, I can say this one actually has three distinct stages for my nose, a bit of a lost art. Initially I was troubled - it didn’t grab me - but worked with it and was pleased with the smooth, luscious dry down. It’s full bodied, not linear.",05/04/25 03:15,Fragrancekmc

Where are the top notes, or even better base notes?? I can't smell any of them....Strangely this perfume reminds me of another super flowery one, could it be Burberry London for her (minus jasmine but instead another overpowering flower) ?",04/02/25 05:39,zoeie

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I have a hard time to like or even tolerate dominant orange blossom - not an easy starting point in an oversaturated market of white floral forward fragrances over all other floral olfactory types. I was randomly strolling around in a local drugstore as usual to get my fresh kick of sensory input, and it striked me that I immediately liked this one and wasn’t repelled by the particular flower I recognize very well - I seriously think this is orange blossom done right and captures that balsamic, slightly solar nature of it. The mildly resinous character of Nuit d’Egypte has a lot of potential to deepen, if it’s let to macerate and mature properly. I had the first Jasmin Naturelle release for a while because Chloé managed to encapsulate that Mediterranean vibe authentically and was able to lure me in, even though I don’t like heady white florals at all.",03/23/25 06:05,mothtoaflame___
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I was the original Nomade wearer after it came out, so I'm really familiar with its DNA. I always thought of it as a very modern, contemporary, unisex, open-minded, business environment-friendly scent, so I was a bit confused after sampling Nuit d'Egypte. What does it have to do with the Nomade range? This should have been its own release. The theme really asks for it.

Anyway - mind blowing fragrance. What I said about the original, this is everything opposite: ancient, deep, mysterious, drawing references to situational and historical frameworks. I was instantly teleported to an Egyptian temple that I love and the smell of myrrh and other ceremonial substances. I love ancient Egypt, and I believe this will go so well with wearing my ankh necklace. Very good longevity and projection, strong presence.

This is a standalone creation that draws on Egypt’s history. The myrrh is so opulent at the beginning, and it really brings the temple vibes - I wish it'd stay for longer though. There is kyphi as a middle note, which is an ancient Egyptian incense scent accord, that's why it's like nothing else, you'll hardly find this note in other fragrances. All notes just work so beautifully together, and more of them are unique, not just kyphi.

Rich, opulent, grounded, balsamic, meditative scent - absolutely sacred. I'm very impressed by this one, and I must have it in my collection.",03/15/25 02:49,MetaMystic
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"its a cozy feminine vanilla cinnamon perfume. But unfortunately it doesn't last long, i can put 5-6 sprays and after couple of hours there is nothing left, this is not a perfume that will stick on your clothes the next day.",03/13/25 08:35,KaisaV
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"This fragrance has become one of my favorites, the opening notes almost combine with the mid notes initially and i can instantly smell the orange blossom which is smooth not sharp. The Kyphi is what does it for me being that it is warming and spicy yet not too heavy, pairing this with the vanilla is perfection. It will be perfect for those summer evenings snuggled in a blanket watching the night sky with a glass of Malbec.
It smells different to any other current fragrance on the high street which I like as many are just flankers of their former self.",03/06/25 08:58,Carla_Louise
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,I enjoy this scent very much. I sprayed it on my jacket and could still smell it the next day when putting it on. I also smelled it on my skin for more than 14+ hours although I admit I sprayed probably 6-8 sprays before leaving the house. I tried the original Nomade and liked that one well enough but I LOVE this version. I think my nose is broken because I don't smell the individual components like many others can. I do get a spiciness that cuts through the florals but nowhere near the way it does in the original Nomade. Definitely one I will be reaching for over and over this spring.,03/02/25 06:48,Chatterbox22

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"this was a really nice surprise, especially for a designer fragrance.

it smells very, very opulent and creamy. it's softly spicy, floral and oriental - i think the myrrh really stands out and makes it beautiful and rich smelling. it remains pretty linear throughout, and the performance is sub-par, but it smells really nice and different from most of the designer offerings, particularly those at its price point.

7/10
it's missing the 'wow' factor for me, but it's a breath of fresh air on the designer market. performance not the best but it's hardly super expensive - i think it's fair for it's price.",02/15/25 13:06,tuilark
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"On my skin this perfume is at first whiff almost citrusy, then spicy and finally settles as a warm, spicy vanilla. I can understand those who says it reminds them of Libre. I actually thought of Libre Intense when I first smelled it on a paper strip. Not alike, but similar vibe. It has relatively good longevity. It is very nice during cold and winter. Have not tested in warm weather. Opinion so far: well made and beautiful.

That’s how this perfume smells like. Embrace of the cashmere, under the desert night.",01/30/25 13:24,Lelena
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I tend to avoid scents with vanilla note, not because I hate vanilla, but because it usually overshadows anything else there might be. This is exactly such a case. To me it's an identical twin of Almafolia (Giardini di Toscana), and both of them vaguely remmind of Aura Mugler. And the common feature is heavy, hot, spicy-sweet, suffocating vanilla. I could like it so much more without it.",01/30/25 04:57,greshnovato

edit: just remembered what this reminds me of - Gaultier's Classique EDT. Classique is stronger and heavier on the vanilla/amber whereas Nomade d'Egypte has more emphasis on the flowers, but these two are very similar.",12/20/24 00:37,bringprivateaccordback

But it has such nice notes. It's fresh, the perfect amount of sweet and a little spicy. Would recommend. But don't blind buy. I feel like Nomades are love or hate perfumes. You can either find them perfect or too much.",11/27/24 01:40,In_love_like_a_rose
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"A pretty fragrance which opens up with a mish mash of notes, before settling down.

I get ginger, cinnamon and myrrh quite strongly on the opening, so I don't find it very enjoyable until about 10 mins into the dry down, when the floral notes join the party and then the fragrance really comes into its own and I find it quite unique and sensual.

I keep putting my nose to the back of my hand to smell it and I really do like it. It's spicy, warm, slightly vanillic and sweet. Although I'm not sure where the sweetness is coming from.

I think that I would buy it, for days that I'm in an intimate setting as the only issue with it is the projection, which is quite close, but I don't mind reapplyling if I have to",11/26/24 10:00,amanda-m-lewis
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I have a sample for which I cannot give a great review. I like to appreciate the fragrances well after several uses, but it was a crush at first smell, I am not a fan of Chloé mainly because of the way they treat the note of rose, is not my profile of fragrances but the Nomade line has magic, the hands and excellent nose of Quentin Bisch created the first three of the line and although this one has no point in common with those outside the name, you feel a fragrance of enormous quality although do not propose anything new, the orange blossom in its most enjoyable facet (to my personal taste) with a vanilla far from everything that is currently sold, here there are no excesses of sweet, nor anything lactonic and much less gourmand, this is a oriental vanilla and it cannot be otherwise because of the components that accompany it and give it an exceptional depth and maturity (myrrh, opoconaco and cinnamon) which are not protagonists nor are they felt individually but together with the vanilla with the orange flowers create a very pleasant fragrance and although it has points in common with many other things, it is not similar to anything that is in trend right now, the ginger gives an effusive touch to the dry down and a small touch of cypriol the woody touch but away from the facet of the Oud.
Nomade Nuit by Egypt is a fragrance that, although I admit, falls short of what we expected from its name (maybe a little more smoky or balsamic is missing) but it is not on a safe release, I like it because it is well made and who knows how to appreciate a fragrance well achieved, you cannot let it pass.",11/24/24 00:47,Abry_81
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I'm not a fan of Chloe fragrances and this is the first one I bought and blind bought! Thank God it worked out because I'm not a fan of the brand in general. I had a feeling this was the Nomade flanker for me so when I got a 40% off coupon I went for it. This reminds me of Armani Code for Women which I own but that's fine. I love the orange blossom, jasmine, meets spices and resins theme here so this will get a lot of wear in my collection. A year round day or night fragrance. Pretty without being complicated or trying to hard. It smells like quality ingredients were used and it is heavy orange blossom floral. A very sweet floral but floral none the less. I wish they kicked up the incense but it is still nice but safe. This is a likeable easy to wear around others incense type of floral. Very sweet, a bit heady, friendly, but a touch sexy. Great first date fragrance. Girl/woman next door pretty. Just my style.",11/23/24 11:52,LSAUG
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"Nomade une Nuit d'Egypte is its own unique experience, do not expect it to be too similar to the original Nomade. It's a spicy orange with a warm, not overly synthetic amber base. Cinnamon in the opening along with the juicy orange, and amber and myrrh in the drydown - just not getting too much of the white floral. I have a thing for anything orange/neroli/petitgrain, plus I love the smell of myrrh, so this was a love at first sniff. Exactly what I would imagine, if someone said they had captured the essence of Egypt in a perfume, it plays into the fantasy so well.",11/16/24 01:17,Heliodora
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"While Nomade by Chloe is a boring disaster, Nomade Nuit d'Egypte is actually interesting.
In the beginning of it's journey, it smells like candied fruits from panettone and a bit like the panettone itself. It smells like vanilla baking powdered sugar (given by the vanilla note), candied fruits (given by the myrrh and cinnamon note) candied oranges (given by the orange blossom note) and a little bit like Egyptian incense.
I would actually consider buying this fragrance if it didn't lose it's panettone smell after the dry down. After it dries down, Nomade Nuit d'Egypte smells only like a soft vanilla powder.",11/12/24 05:59,JuliaToothFairy

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"A really interesting spicy amber white floral. A blend of opposites. Almost mystical feeling, like bright stars in a black desert sky.

Despite its unusualness this is a friendly fragrance, the spice very tame, and the florals subdued by ambery warmth. An alluring fragrance that keeps you engaged and enchanted. It’s not at all like the original Nomade fragrance (which is lovely in its own right); this version is deeper, darker, a distant cousin if it bears any relation at all.

I’ve never encountered a fragrance that so deeply embodied twilight. Nuit d'Egypte is that deep shade of blue the sky turns with night flowers opening beneath it, hints of incense wafting in from far away. A dark airiness but warm, enchanting. Deepens as it wears.",11/06/24 12:18,darkforestmags
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"Soft vanilla-floral with a touch of spice. There’s orange blossom, of course, but also a hint of jasmine. The spice is very subtle, just the tiniest touch of ginger and resin incense. It has a beautiful ambery warmth also. There is no similarity to the original Nomade.

While I like this, it does feel a bit too safe. Its name suggests something deeper, darker, and a lot more intense, when in reality it’s a subtle and gentle (albeit very well blended) floral. This would make an ideal everyday fragrance; it projects reasonably but isn’t overpowering and lasts well also, ultimately fading away into a sweet vanilla skin scent.

Pretty, but somehow I expected more.",11/05/24 02:19,Scheherazade_x
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"A warm oriental scent where the orange blossom and jasmine are the main stars. It is rather strong for being a Chloe and lasts at least six hours. After a few hours all you can smell is the vanilla. Not really my kind of scent though.

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I got a tester of this not expecting to like it due to the reviews, but I was still curious because of the description. I don’t own and haven’t smelt any other Chloe perfumes so can’t compare. I mainly use Dolce & Gabanna.

The opening notes I find beautifully intoxicating. It completely draws me in. I really wish it would stay much longer because it smells absolutely divine. I love it so much!

The dry down I find confusing. I get a lovely powdery sensual warm vanilla type vibe on my right wrist and a horrible musty oud on my left which makes absolutely no sense. In fact my left wrist does smell like good girl, which I hate. Having sprayed it on different days, I still get the same outcome. That might put me off long term wear, unless I can find something to layer it with.

I’m undecided on this perfume. It is quite strong, which I think it could become quite nauseating or headache inducing if sprayed too heavily. I wouldn’t say it’s shy at all. It also lasts a good 6 hours on me. I have still purchased a full sized bottle, as it’s nothing like anything else I own. I mostly love this perfume, but hate that musty oud type end note which must be the cypriol oil. This is definitely not a safe blind buy. I’d recommend getting a tester first.",10/25/24 10:42,CaroleAnne81
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I'm a huge fan of Chloé, their perfumes are always so well-blended despite it being a designer brand.

Chloé nomade nuit d'egypte is shy, a bit too shy, which is a shame because she's beautiful! soft powdery and very subtle vanilla, orangeblossom, soft spices but definitely no spice bomb, I pick up on some fruitiness which isn't in the notes, it might be the orangeblossom-ginger combo which makes it smell a bit more citrussy than your usual white floral orangeblossom. There are also a lot of notes I've never heard of before so there might be ones I don't recognise.

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"Nuit d’Egypte couldn’t be any more different to the original Nomade.

This opens with a sweet floral/vanilla/spice combination, with the latter becoming more prominent as it develops. I’m usually 50/50 on amber perfumes, but this one is combined very well with some of my favourite notes (namely orange blossom).

The opening bears some similarity to Armani Code, but that similarity proves to be superficial. On the drydown, it reminds more me of Good Girl, although I do like this better.

While it has some depth, it lacks the gravity to fully live up to its name “Nuit d’Egypte” which invokes way more mystery and intrigue than the scent itself.

Overall, it’s a very pretty and safe “oriental” perfume choice. It is a lovely scent, but not entirely unique or breathtaking. It has wide appeal and so I’d recommend as a blind buy or gift.",09/30/24 12:33,cokette
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I’m surprised people don’t find this to be different. I’ve owned a lot of perfumes, and nothing I’ve ever had smells anything like this. It’s stunning, and it’s one of those perfumes that are so well blended that I don’t really know what I’m smelling.

This doesn’t smell anything like the original Nomad, which I also enjoy, but I like this better.

This somehow smells like Egyptian nights near the Nile. It sort of smells like jasmine, but not how we typically smell it in perfumes. There’s something interesting in here. I get a raw mastic/myrrh incense smell before it’s been burned, like you’re smelling it in the jar. I’m obsessed

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"Soft,slightly spicey orange blossom. Lightly oriental, not what you would expect from the name ""nuit"" in it, as it is more for a day perfume but very charming.",09/10/24 04:20,Silvuna
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"This is a beautiful perfume and I immediately got a full bottle after testing it for a few days.
It starts with a fresh flush of ginger, hint of cinnamon and then seamlessly melts into a vibrant orange blossom. Closely followed by broom, that has a Jasmin like character. After a few hours of floral delight, Kyphy and Oppoponax appear as a solid pair of lightly smokey duo to complete a beautiful fragrance.
I am wearing this scent in searing heat and considering it's an Hommage to Egyptian night, I feel like I'm doing this creation justice. Imho it is a very versatile perfume. Unisex to my nose. Easy to layer. When I needed some oomph at night, I layer it with Divine Vanille by Essential Parfums. This ads more depth with intense Myrre and a smokey vanilla.
My coworkers loved it on me (nurse here) and I love the incensey, creamy vanilla at the base with the resinous Kyphy, that gives a special sprinkle on top.
To my nose this Flanker has little to nothing to do with the originals. Which I like! In the previous Flankers there was oakmoss, that I detest in most fragrances, because it feels very dated to me. This one here is nothing short of beautiful. Crowd pleasing, yet still memorable at the same time due to Kyphi and Broom.
I know some who love the entire line will be disappointed, but everyone who hated the line might love this. Like I do!
This is going to be my fall/ winter fragrance for sure.",09/05/24 07:55,Pandalf
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"Reminds me of Fleur by Nina Ricci, but Fleur is getting more sour while fading. Nuit d' Egypte smells like a museum with kinda nautical notes, definitely in the Nile. However, it gets ordinary after a few minutes and doesn't last long enough. In comparison with the rest Nomade perfumes, this one differs. I like it, but I prefer what the rest express (animalic and leathery notes).",09/02/24 14:54,nior478
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"They managed to make the pyramid look more interesting than the perfume is in reality. This 90% orange blossom, the note that I personally dislike because I find it overly sweet, cloying and I associate it with old ladies. But if you are a lover of Orange Blossom - certainly go for it! Just do not have high hopes for spicy and animalic notes.

For me it smells like GOOD FORTUNE by V&R in the opening.

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I thought I might like this one based on the notes, but Nomade Nuit d'Egypte is waaaay too sweet for me.
The first seconds of the opening were fresh, but after that it became dense and sweet and very linear throughout the wear. I can hardly get any of the notes separately, they're all blended together and indistinguishable to my nose, which makes me confused. Something about the scent seems very artificial, like I cannot believe anything real actually smells like this.
Longevity and sillage on me are great, two sprays on my wrist have lasted seven hours, and it still creates a strong and heavy cloud around me. Its presence has been like noise to me from opening to drydown, and is getting on my nerves. I haven't had this kind of negative reaction to a frag in a while. On the test on paper it seemed fresh, but on the skin it's overwhelmingly sweet, a little bit sickening. The only reason I didn't try to scrub it off yet, is that I wanted to share my impression with you guys first.
I don't think this is a bad perfume, but I do think it depends a lot on skin and preferences. Definitely not blind buy.

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"Wow!! Just wow! I tried this and it blew my mind! I wasnt even eager to try it as I dont really found any nomade to like a lot before. But today i picked it up and smell the cap, and it was almost intoxicating, i rarely get that from smelling caps. I had to spray on my arm and it was sooo good. All the way back home, a 45 minute drive, I couldn stop smell my arm, and it created this nice comforting scent bubble around me in the car. Not to strong but not weak either. The orange blossom is there for sure, thats the main star, with some sweetness i guess from vanilla. It does not smell very vanillary though, but it does have a sweet side to it. The spicy notes are not spicy in any way, but probably create some depth and warmth, but I cant pinpoint any of the spicy notes at all. I regret not buying it, but will for sure grab it next time!

Its attributes are perfect for a healthcare setting and this will be a long-time fav of mine, for sure. Love the way it develops on the skin, with the resinous aspect and vanilla coming out after a few hours, vs on clothing how the amber is more prominent and retains floral -- such a great combo.

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé
(Store Test, King Power Airport, first visit).

I walk across the fragrance store and it names suggest something probably Florental.
So I put 2 sprays, 1 on paper and 1 on back of hand.

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte by Chloé is truly White Florental fragrance (specific - Orange Blossom).
At very first contract I do recall something in realm of L'interdit by Givenchy too.
But hang with me, this is not.

Nuit d’Egypte Flanker, open with White Floral beautifully. Soft Citrus and Fresh tone.
Do really lure me to think it as a fresher fragrance. It takes around 30 mins for this fragrance to release its amber experience.

This amber is denser as time pass, and I would say this is ""late 201x florental style"" amber.
Something like ""Ange ou Demon Le Parfum"". It is Sweet, Dense, Powdery amber to my nose.
It is also, add something to recreate animalic tone amber. The one that use in ""CoCo"" by Chanel.

When scent is reach final dry down.
it is powdery vanilla experience, with soft floral support.

I think this is lovely throw back time on Florental fragrance.
It is not keeping at fresh side of think like Atlas Garden by YSL.
It is not overly green at base tho, It is pretty much ""Orange Blossom with Oriental Amber""

Cons, it might be too sharp as Orange Blossom can make you feel coiling.
With dense amber, it is combo for long-time white flower x amber user only.
It has tendency to knock you out.

Hey, if It hits discounter at 65-70 USD something.
I would probably keep this in collection.",06/08/24 03:59,tanaC
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"It’s nice…very nice! Nice with a capital N. Cozy, smooth vanilla with orange blossom, on the powdery side. Softly spicy and resinous. Warm, but not so much that it can’t be worn on summer evenings. Sweet but clean smelling. Creamy, milky drydown. Versatile, and will work all year round and in various situations. It’s easy to wear. Better than YSL’s overhyped Babycat for me. Good for days and nights when you want to be low-key or subtle but still feminine and sensual. Will work in an office setting or an intimate date night. I imagine this is the type of scent men would love on their women, as it smells amazing up close, alluring and sensual but also cozy…’wife-material’ sort of scent I guess. Not an exciting one or a love at first sniff, but it grows on you, and that soft, creamy, lactonic vanilla drydown is addictive, eventhough it’s close to the skin (am I the only one getting that lactonic note??). Soft to moderate sillage and very good longevity on skin. Has the same vibe as one of my favorite cheapies (Guess Seductive, also compared to Armani Code), but more refined and complex with better notes. Don’t understand reviews comparing it to Libre or it’s flankers, I dislike them, they are harsh and veer into masculine territory on me, not a fan of lavender + orange blossom together in a fragrance. This one is smooth and cozy all the way, even the spices are smoothened.",06/05/24 20:56,marialena888m

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"Nuit d'Egypte debuts in a big way. A unique mix of vanilla resins, slightly ambery. It is exactly how you imagine the air would smell in an Egyptian night. A perfect combination, like a puzzle, between Eastern and Western trends in perfumery. But there's a just that... All this wonder doesn't last long. Its uniqueness easily dissipates like a mist in the sun's rays, the perfume evolves into a warm, slightly spiced amber and remains in this way, linearly, until the end.
It should be mentioned that it could be an independent perfume and not a flanker because it has nothing in common with the fruity cypres Nomade.
It has an excellent performance, nothing to say. It seems that the Chloe brand respects its customers and respects itself. It doesn't release perfumes countless, and when it launches something, quality represent a priority.
My only regret is that that absolutely sensational debut is not much more...

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"What a beautiful blended myrrh mixed with vanilla, cinnamon, opoponax, orange blossom and broom flower. Chloe Nomade Nuit d’Egypte smells like a warm, soft, cozy, enveloping scent that’s made for fall or early spring days when the weather is still cold but not too cold. Because unfortunately, as beautiful and smooth as it is, it’s not a very intense or good projecting scent.

And for that reason I would not get a bottle of Nuit d’Egypte until it becomes more reasonably priced because it is kind of lacking in performance. And it’s expensive.

Otherwise, I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone, who’s looking for a creamy, ambery, sweet, resinous, balsamic vanilla heavy perfume with white florals and citrus nuances for cooler seasons. It’s beautifully done..",05/01/24 02:21,Maya lilac

It's a spring/summer fragrance IMO...",04/21/24 00:54,The Athenian Gentleman
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I love it so much. It's not straight up orangeblossom. Yes, it's a crowdpleaser, but what's wrong with that? Performance could be better but still good. 4-5 hours on skin, on clothes, the whole day and then some. The sweetness is juuust perfect! And that drydown vanilla 🤤...

What does it smell like? Well, nothing like nomade, just a hint of the DNA far far in the background. Opening a blast of orangeblossom and candied fruit. Mmmmm. Zero cinnamon t.m.n. The ginger I got in the drydown, spicy peppery, so gooood, but you have to spray liberally!

Edit: I got the opoponax, aka incense, but it only showed itself on clothes and again I sprayed quite liberally.) Was driving and thinking why am I smelling incense on my jacket? Jup.

The drydown is VANILLA, Orange Blossom, iris, a hint of spicyness from the ginger, a hint of incense and some delicious sweetness of the fruits. I have no idea what Kyphi smells like. 🤷. What matters that it's utterly addictive.

This fragrance is very much misunderstood by first impression sniffers, which i get. Get yourself a sample or two, douce yourself incl clothes and get testing. This can stand next to niche orangeblossom fragrances quality and scentwise, imo. Performance on clothes is excellent and doesn't morph into something else, but the ginger and incense does show itself better. The amount used here is chef's kiss. Just adds a bit of interest but is not intrusive at all. The balance here is PERFECT. 10/10 I'm in love 🤩

Also, headscratch. imo....smells nothing like nomade naturelle tmn which i've tested twice on skin. It's way better and more modern then terracotta but still has that same vintage floral vibe in the drydown, like terracotta, which i don't love so that was a pass for me. But i do get why it's loved!

Nuit d'Egypte is all about fruity vanillic orangeblossom. Naturelle is about tropical-coconutty banana jasmine.
First impression reviews are just that, a first impression and should be taken with a big bag of salt, even more then the already very subjective opinion of someone who owns the fragrance.

There's a creamy tropical edge to Nuit d'Egypte, which fits the yellow flowers theme but I do not get most of the resins and spices listed as notes.

If Dior Addict (citrus-white floral-vanilla) and grand soir (amber-vanilla) had a cheapie baby, this would be it. 🐥 It's intoxicating, very strong in sillage at first hour, then calms down to a skin scent. Quite sweet, quite ambery, deliciously citric and white floral.

Reminds me of early 2010s perfumes.

There is a memory I have tied to this scent, and a good one at that. I wonder what is it? Reminds me of one of my sister's cool friends, the times of watching Buffy the Vampire slayer 🦇 and of Cosmopolitan magazines.
It makes me wanna dress up and get my ducks in order, but in an late 2000s way. I also get bubblegum. 🧋

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"Nuit d'Egypte smells mainly of myrrh and honey (broom) with a hint of orange blossom. It's delicately balsamic, I really like it; it looks like an oriental ointment.

It reminded me of Opium and - be attentive - NOT at all because they really resemble each other (Opium is imposing and strong, this one rather light and sweet) but because of this resinous facet brought by the myrrh and the opoponax, almost ""medicinal"". It's more of a feeling than a real resemblance.

I find a little mysterious and oriental side to it which attracts me irresistibly and I think that - without being exceptional - it is a more original composition than what we find nowadays.

It's a shame that the staying power and sillage are so light, I would have liked it to be a little more daring.",03/04/24 07:39,Saveria

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I own FBs of every Nomade besides this and jasmine naturelle. I hadn’t gotten around to JN yet when they released this. I thought this sounded way more interesting so I bought an official carded mini spray.

First, I’d recommend letting your bottle or sample sit and rest for a few days before sampling. This scent is a bit unstable and comes off different if it’s been shaken. When it arrived I did a wrist spray test and thought it opened up awesomely spicy but quickly faded into the strongest GRAPE jasmine I’ve ever come across (and I’m a white floral fan with a large collection, so I’ve tried a lot of jasmine). The grape was like purple Gatorade on my skin, synthetic, sweet, strong, strange. It felt like Nomade Naturelle with strong persistent fake grape juice. I actually double checked my vial to make sure I didn’t get a jasmine naturelle spray in a nuit d’egypt card. I then checked the notes again and was dumbfounded.

I put my sample aside to rest and retested a week later. Now, it smells mostly like the notes (the notes I’m familiar with). I’d describe this most simply as a spicy sweet orange flower scent. It’s pretty simple and straightforward if you’re familiar with orange flower scents. Definitely reminds me the most of Roberto Cavalli EDP with a touch of Gaultiers Classique Essence / intense (both discontinued) but sweeter and a bit spicier. I am familiar with some of the “reminds me of” scents here and most smell nothing like this to me besides Roberto Cavalli. Maybe Dior Addict as well but I need to retest that one. I’d say there’s a subtle reminiscence to Alien Fusion and Azzaro Wanted Girl, mostly with the gingery spices.

The spices don’t exactly feel as exotic or potent as I hoped. I mostly get a ginger, touch of cinnamon, and some subtle spicy aromatics in the background. If the only listed notes for this scent were “orange flower, vanilla, ginger, and cinnamon” I’d say “yup that’s what I smell!” I don’t get the other spices enough to distinguish them. As the scent dries down, I do feel like I’m getting an occasional subtle whiff of jasmine again, but it isn’t strong pure grape juice concentrate like before, it’s more gentle realistic white floral. I’m guessing one of the spices or notes I’m less familiar with are tricking me into thinking it’s jasmine.

I suppose that’s where the criticisms come from claiming this scent isn’t very unique. I think just about every fragrance line has an orange flower scent somewhat similar to this. But so what? I think Nomade Naturelle smells like monoi, which is not a new or unique scent at all, but the quality, composition, and performance set it apart so much that I chose it over other similar scents that didn’t smell as beautiful. Initially I wasn’t thrilled with Nuit D’Egypt when I thought it was too grapey. However now the orange flowers are coming out and I’m finding it so beautiful. Many orange flower scents do not last on my skin at all and/or I go nose blind to them rapidly. This unfortunate phenomenon led me to “declutter” several expensive perfumes that I couldn’t smell 15 minutes after spraying. However they changed the formula in this Naturelle line, somehow these orange flowers are lasting on my skin and I can keep smelling them. I only have a couple other orange flower fragrances that last and project with my chemistry, but those aren’t orange flower-centric and/or I end up pulling more of the other notes besides the flower when I wear them.

I’d recommend this for women looking for the ultimate spicy sweet orange flower fragrance. Bonus points for the natural ingredients. Overall very nice, I will likely add this to my collection down the road once I’ve finished up some of my other orange flower scents. I like this blend more! Ultimately, I have the same reaction I did when I got Nomade Naturelle. Neither have the most unique composition but both are excellent quality, very mass-pleasing blends and smell like it. I believe both stand out against similar fragrances as better compositions.

I’d say performance is similar to Nomade Naturelle in terms of silage and longevity.

I wouldn’t expect too much of an “exotic Egyptian” or “night” type of vibe. This scent can work at night but has a solar aspect that makes me want to wear it in the sunshine. There aren’t any real exotic spice notes that I can’t find elsewhere, and I don’t get incense, unfortunately, but it’s still a gorgeous scent.",03/02/24 07:24,wondervalley666
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"Trying Chloé perfume for the first time, and I'm impressed. The spicy warmth of the aroma is uplifting, feminine, and subjectively quite universal. The scent of warm cinnamon and citrus notes lingered on my hand for hours after I put a tiny amount on my wrist while testing the aroma at the drugstore. I now seriously consider making it my new signature scent.",03/01/24 05:49,cicilija345
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I was so looking forward to trying this. It sounded intriguing and mysterious and I hoped it would be a wondrous mix of light and smoke. On first spray I was hopeful, it reminded me somewhat of myrrh and tonka which I love, but this impression did not last long. The notes don't mention jasmine, but to my nose I can smell jasmine in amongst the powdery sweet orange blossom. At this stage, it reminds me of YSL Libre EDT. The first time I tried it, it faded down to an ever so slightly spicy, sweet drydown very quickly then was gone without trace from my skin. Even sprayed on fabric the longevity was pretty poor. On second try I decided to be a little more generous in my sprays- two on neck instead of one and both wrists and elbows. This was a mistake. Unfortunately there is something in the composition that comes out swinging when over sprayed. I don't know if it's the cinnamon, ginger or cypriol, or a combination of the three, but it caused headache and nausea. Luckily it still didn't last long and faded away within an hour or two. I was expecting something different and unusual from this fragrance but every time I smell it I have the vague feeling I have smelt this somewhere before. I'm disappointed it didn't meet my high expectations. It could be fairly pleasant lightly sprayed but it is not a love for me, and not worth the money for a full bottle when it is so fleeting. For now at least I am pleased I only have a decant. We shall see if it grows on me.",02/29/24 07:37,LMD
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"YSL Cinema is that you? I am currently Cinema wearing to work so very familiar with and was taken aback when I sprayed this.

Maybe if I was to choose between the two I would pick the Chloe as the base is marginally more complex but owning both would be ridiculously redundant.

A non gourmand orange vanilla. No myrrh and the cinnamon is buried deep.

So in summary I like it a lot as it is in my orange amber wheelhouse and so would wear it day to day happily but I am disappointed that it doesn’t live up to the scent pyramid which promised more.",02/28/24 02:43,Luckyed
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,This was a blind buy for me. Smells identical to Armani Code.,02/27/24 20:00,KBreckenridge
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"Sweet and spicy. A good blend of white and yellow florals. I get a light and syrupy sweetness and a warm balsamic tone. I can really feel the spices on my nose and tongue. Not too heavy, I think it would be appropriate for day or night. Fall through spring. Probably to sweet for very hot weather. I think it fits the Nomade line perfectly. Its very different than the others but still has that kinda upscale traveling hippie vibe of Nomade.
It's like smelling night blooming flowers on the breeze on a balmy night in some exotic location.
I'm happy to have it in my collection.",02/23/24 08:30,Trinab
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"I must say that the original Nomade was a love at first sniff for me. What captivated me was the interplay of a lightly sweet fruitiness with woody notes. Therefore, I was eager to try Nuit d’Egypte, also because of the addition of orange blossom. However, I feel that this flanker is a pale version of the original: from the beginning to the end, I get mostly a transparent, dry and slightly sour muskiness. The orange blossom is hidden behind that veil of musk, peeking through from time to time. In my opinion, this fragrance has not much similarities with the original Nomade.",02/23/24 00:31,KöbiD
Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"To be fair, I don't know the original Nomade, but I don't get any spices really, it's just artificial jasmine and white flowers. Very generic floral perfume to my nose, (I'm not much of a fan of florals as you can probably tell!)",02/21/24 02:18,Zethre

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"Got a 30ml today - I love Nomade Naturelle and was super excited to try this one! I’m fascinated by Egypt since I was very small, so I loved the story behind the fragrance and the notes looked like something I would be into. To me this fragrance smells like a huge bouquet of freesias. It’s floral and a tinny tiny bit spicy, it’s pretty and very wearable in my opinion, safe for office space and daily wear. I was expecting a more heavy perfume based on the notes listed, but this is very subtle. It matches the Nomade line, it’s a sweet addition, but unfortunately not what I thought it would be. I wanted something more mysterious, oriental, heavy and long lasting.

Edit: I’ve layered this with Armani Prive Indigo Tanzanite and it’s now everything I wanted from it. Suggest trying layering it with stronger, oriental and masculine leaning scents.",02/15/24 09:21,bittersweetpoison

Nomade Nuit d’Egypte Chloé,"It’s just pretty. I was super hyped for this one because I adore Chloe Nomade and every flanker so far. This on doesn’t have any Nomade or Nomade Naturel DNA.

So Im a lil a bit disappointed as I was looking forward to this one and tbh it kind of smell generic to me..

Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"A very interesting take on vanilla. I recently got a 150 ml bottle after trying it at a Sephora store in Singapore. It’s very green and floral. It’s not loud, but has a decent longevity.

Really enjoyed layering this with J-Scent’s Black Leather.",10/25/25 04:00,torres_jake
Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"It is one of the few perfumes that truly moves me...Vanilla Planifolia is everything I wanted it to be: soft, but unforgettable and addictive. As others mentioned, I get a green banana peel in the opening mixed with soft spices (probably cinnamon). The banana smells quickly dissipate and you're left with a delicate vanilla flower and incense. I find it mesmerizing and although some would say it sits too close to the skin, I think that's the intention here. It's delicate like a petal and feels like a loving hug.",10/21/25 18:43,RoseDLB

Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,First sniff is green with a touch of spice — but spice in the sense that it piques your interest not in an overwhelming clove/cinnamon/gross way. It's a stunning and straightforward scent throughout. I got a compliment from a stranger on this. My favorite vanilla.,09/16/25 11:39,LMW321
Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"I wanted to really like this I’m glad I got to test it.. we’ll see if it grows on me but for right now it is a very green vanilla. You definitely pick up on the spices that I feel like ruined this fragrance for me. I love spices, but how it’s done with the type of vanilla that it has in here I think they should’ve just used pink pepper or even Coriander or saffron there’s definitely some notes missing. It’s simple but complex at the same time..
Had to come back and edit this it’s a great easy reach and now that it’s had time to sit for a little it’s deeper then it was you definitely get vanilla along with the spices I think it’s the vanilla orchid it has a little bit of a powderyness but it’s very well balanced I see it being well liked it’s nothing amazing but I can’t dislike it either. It does have that Chloe DNA to it.",09/10/25 17:15,Jessica.etosi@ymail.com
Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"It was hard to track down a sample of this one and I was so excited to finally get my nose on it. Kind of disappointing. It smells nice, but isn't unique or memorable. Very soft and mild. I sprayed heavily on skin and clothes and waited about an hour to run it by my husband. He said it was okay but very faint. Definitely not worth the money. We're both big fans of Chloe Lumineuse, which is much more beautiful and special in my opinion.",09/08/25 20:07,lcarrasco1
Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"wonderful. this might become one of my all time favorite vanilla scents. It opens a tad green, but after 30 min or so it dies down, thankfully. Then you get a sweet vanilla, but not as basic as just vanilla extract. It has a bit of a spicy undertone, but it just ties the scent down instead of ruining it as black pepper can do in some other fragrances. Gucci Flora Gorg Orch is a bit fresher than this.",08/27/25 05:18,stylish_sage

Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"Chloe Vanilla Planifolia starts off very green but also slightly sweet. It’s like a mixture of morning dew on freshly cut grass and unripe green bananas. It’s a bit strange but not quite unpleasant to me. After a little while, a soft powdery vanilla or tonka bean joins the mix. Then the banana becomes more of a banana pudding in the dry down. Sweeter and creamier than before. There’s still a greenness reminiscent of freshly cut grass and flower stems the whole time but it softens a little bit in that final stage of the dry down. It projects softly within arms reach. Unfortunately, this perfume is not for me. I don’t hate it but I also don’t like it. This isn’t something I ever see myself wearing.

Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"I smelt this in store recently and bought it to add to my collection of imaginary vanilla flower scents as I am tired of all of the woody vanillas which lean too gourmand or too spicy. I love eating vanilla and smelling vanilla and am always searching for something different that is not the dried fruit of the vanilla orchid, ie the dried pod.

To me, this is indeed what I want to believe a vanilla orchid flower could smell like. It is a gorgeous enveloping tropical scent (as after all vanilla orchids are tropical flowers!). Beautifully blended; a soft delicate vanilla which pulls ylang ylang to me; i say that having recently mixed ylang ylang essential oil with an unscented body cream which as the natural oil can only reveal, is warm and not loud like it is portrayed in so many perfumes.

I sprayed vanilla planifolia all over me before bed last night and woke warm and cosy; the fragrance gently remained on my skin. I don’t smell banana at all; this is sweet, but gently floral as it dries down. I like it ❤️",06/19/25 00:29,elizabeth.grayton
Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"It is a delightful vanilla scent. I feel like it has green notes reminding of fresh banana.

Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"This is the first Chloe in my collection, as in general this brand does pretty good, but not my cup of perfume :) However I had interest to this perfume once it was launched, because I love vanilla in it's all aspects. And I did not think too long, just 5 years and voila- this perfume is mine! :) I sprayed it just 10 min ago and can not say anything about it's technical characteristics, however this 'soliflor' (single flower) composition is unusual in a very good way. Same effect as Vanilla Planifolia from Guerlain- effect of deep thinking about what you feel when you sniff it. It's not the effect that you would expect from 'just vanilla'. I literally had an image of a refined beige-yellowish, delicate velvety surface that which at some point it suddenly gleams with a light green, smooth-satin surface. I literally have this visual image. Never happened to me. Now after 15 min I don't have this green satin glim, but it was interesting. I really like this perfume. It's really worth to try. Not a typical vanilla perfume.
If you want to know if it has some similarities with Guerlain Vanilla Planifolia. It's just similar name.",05/06/25 22:01,Istra

I wasn’t sure what to expect from some of the reviews, and was a bit unsure on the initial opening, but I love it! It’s a smell I recognise, walking along paths on a tropical island. The air is humid and you can smell the slightly sweet mix of plants and flowers. That’s the scent I pick up from this. It’s a fresh, green scent with some crisp, clean vanilla in the background. I find it quite comforting. It’s a soft scent to me, although my boyfriend could smell this before I even entered the room and he loves it. Very feminine and sophisticated. This is a scent that makes me feel put together. Perfect for all year round.",03/07/25 05:59,CaroleAnne81
Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"Shoot. I bought a sample of this thinking it really would rival Diptyque’s Eau Duelle based on hype reviews. Oh how I was let down.
Whereas Diptyque smells like natural vanilla reminiscent of vanilla extract on me, Chloe’s Vanilla is a synthetic sweet. It must be the Iso-e I am so sensitive to, because this is just one of too many plasticky fruity gourmands that’s instant hate. I can’t even really pick out the vanilla here, I just get the plastic sweet that hurts my sinuses after a few sniffs. Not sure why but it almost reminds me of cotton… like synthetic cotton? Orchid is usually also not a hit for me, so there’s that.

Overall so glad I got a full Eau Duelle.",02/18/25 20:09,LoafyLady
Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"This smells like Lush American Cream (the perfume). It's a softer version. Chalky is the key word to describe it. Chalky and herbal. Not my style.

Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"Vanilla Planifolia is everything I wanted it to be and more. It opens with the juiciest, nectar-filled orchids—so vibrant and golden, they almost feel alive. They’re dripping in this creamy, thick vanilla milk, but it’s not your usual sugary vanilla. This one’s smooth and mellow, like the perfect amount of rich and gentle. It feels warm and cozy, but somehow airy, a richness that wraps without suffocating. After a bit, there’s this hint of spicy wood shavings just enough to add a bit of texture. But the woods don’t hang around for long, fading gently into the background and leaving the orchids and vanilla to take center stage. There’s this almost edible quality to it, too, gourmand but also juicy and floral in a way that keeps it bright and alive. Honestly, it’s addictive—god knows how many times I've sniffed my wrist—like a vanilla orchid dessert I’d happily drown in.",01/23/25 03:12,luvoxlixir

Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"Vanilla Planifolia is the second perfume I have tried from the Atelier des Fleur collection and I like it better than Ylang Cananga. I find it again, a fairly light, airy orchid vanilla scent but at least this one has a bit of complexity and contrast. It’s not just bottled vanilla sold for more than 250 euros per bottle. Has some spicy, floral, woody facets that makes it more interesting and faceted.

But again, too light for the price! The bottles of this line look very classy and heavy with a minimalist style but the intensity of the scents really leaves me wanting more.

If money would be no issue, don’t get me wrong, I would like to have a bottle of these on my dresser. But I’m not there yet. I can’t justify spending so much for something so weak!",10/01/24 00:47,Maya lilac

Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"it's devastating when you have an idea of what a perfume will be like in your head but it doesn't work out once you actually try it :( this is why I will never blind buy! vanilla planifolia is pleasant enough but I was so hoping that the combination of notes would be airy and light on the skin. I think the ambiguous spices are ruining it for me. I also agree with other people who are detecting something green on the skin, even though no green notes are listed. It's a perfectly good likeable fragrance, just not what I was hoping for and sadly not full-bottle worthy for me.",03/24/24 10:46,fraghead97
Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"It's cookie dough, like I smell vanilla extract
and I can feel the dough on the back of my mouth(a bit dry), a spoonful of sugar, very crunchy... and a pinch of salt?
Floral note adds to it so this could be chai or chamomile flavored
Interesting gourmand but I was looking for something freshier, colder",01/16/24 16:02,Young106
Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"Gorgeous. Worth every penny and the long wait for it to come back in stock.

Opens fresh and airy floral heavy gourmand with green notes, the plants, the stems, the petals. It feels edible when you spray, but the plant-ness of it makes it feel more in the family of a fresh lavender sugar cookie or French violet toffee candy. It almost feels like there’s a touch of mint in it. I think this is the banana scent others mentioned. Smells like a fresh green banana, unpeeled, not the candy fake banana flavor.

As it dries down, the greenness fades and it develops a sugar crystal cookie top with a sun baked tropical floral base. The florals felt more sharp and aquatic in the opening, like a few other “orchid” notes I’ve sampled, but as this dries down they transform to a soft beachy ylang type smell, maybe a little tuberosey, with a good amount of vanilla.

It’s lovely on its own or, as it was designed, can be layered nicely with other scents. Not ideal for someone looking for a straight simple vanilla gourmand or for people who don’t like floral scents. Smells expensive and well designed. It seems simple upon first test but the scent evolves very nicely. Perfect for easy days when you just want to feel pretty but don’t want a scent that demands the attention of the entire room. Or for dates in the park wearing a sun dress. I’m currently wearing in the winter and it smells very nice and not out of character for the season as well.

Doesn’t quite smell like anything else I’ve tried before. That doesn’t say much, but I can tell this is different. Very unique. I much prefer it to a lot of popular “vanilla” scents, but I also seem to fall in love with a lot of Quentin Bisch’s work way harder than I do for any others, it’s even happened with scents I didn’t realize he designed until later on.

I feel like this scent will probably be stored next to my beloved La Belle Fleur Terrible (same designer) as they feel similar though smell different. Both are vanilla heavy tropical florals. Chloe is light and chic and more gourmand. Fleur Terrible is heavier tropical and floral with a spicy woody vibe, not exactly edible. (Fleur Terrible is getting relaunched this year and will be renamed “La Belle Paradise Garden” btw for those curious). I wouldn’t say they are interchangeable at all or that owning both is redundant, they smell very different from each other to my nose.

I’ll definitely be buying a backup of this.",01/04/24 14:01,wondervalley666
Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"Not a good experience, doesn't really smells of vanilla. I was expecting an airy, comforting scent but it's nothing like that.
From the cap, I get a floral vanilic, airy, almost chamomile warm smell.
On skin and clothes it only smells like crystalized sugar from the get go till the end.
I cannot find a single good aspect of this perfume and unfortunately I could never wear it, not even one spray, that's how flat and just pure sugar it gets.",11/17/23 11:25,Elenad

Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"What a delightful and wonderful surprise this fragrance took me by!! I was not expecting to smell something so “light” and airy as this…this was truly a great experience, one I wish many fragrances would make happen. But I digress.

Vanilla Planifolia smells airy and slightly green. Not the same green as Angélique Noire by Guerlain nor Ani by Nishane. It is its own. But it is “light”, airy and fresh and yet deliciously floral with a slight touch of warmth (the vanilla?). Does this make any sense? Probably not. I had to blind buy it as it came up on my notifications from Nordstrom and I rushed to get one of the few bottles they had left! This fragrance sells out very quickly and with good reason! This is a vanilla that is neither sweet nor gourmand and yet, it manages to take me to paradise when I spray it on my skin.

Longevity: surprisingly long!! 8+ hours on my skin!
Sillage/Projection: very mild, almost shy but I love it!!!
Season: anytime/anywhere! This is an easy one to wear!
Price: look, it’s a masterpiece! I don’t care how much it costs, and my ONLY regret is that I couldn’t get the 5oz bottle as it is difficult to find.
It’s backup worthy (in my humble opinion) and so well blended that I will sing its praises all the way to the Angels and back⭐️⭐️⭐️✨⭐️⭐️⭐️

Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"Oh hell no. From the cap it smells sensual. Just as described, but both on paper and on my skin its unbearable.

Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,I love Chloe but this is VERY powdery. Undoably powdery. More powder than vanilla. Hard pass for me.,02/02/23 07:51,KBreckenridge
Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"This is Quentin Bisch's take on the (imaginary) scent of vanilla orchids and I get it. Real vanilla orchids have no smell but this is a bright, welcoming floral vanilla. Slightly velvety, reminiscent of the softness of orchid petals between one's fingers. Light, airy, but not fleeting-- this one stays present. It's super elegant yet feels so versatile you could wear it in any kind of situation.

This is a wonderful floral scent, once again. To me it's not a full-on gourmand vanilla even though it's slightly sweet. But it's sweet enough to make you want to smell it again and again. It's very warm weather appropriate. I can't wait to try it on a slightly windy weather, when sunny spring days will be back.

Simple, very elegant and optimistic. My favourite take on a floral vanilla.",01/22/23 07:46,ChocoLei

Smells unique and alluring
Has a touch of sour to it, not sure where its coming from though.

Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"Very pretty fresh, but still sweet, vanilla. I get 4 hours with 6 sprays. It's nice, you could wear it in the summer and be safe. It also has a ""green"" aspect to it.

Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"I have to say I'm underwhelmed by this. Very flat. Yes, there is vanilla, orchid, woody notes but this perfume is lacking depth and energy. It smells like a basic vanilla orchid body spray and not a fine expensive fragrance. And this line is expensive. I expect value for my money. A friend kindly sent me these samples I have been reviewing so I'm not out any $$$ but I just don't think this scent is worth the asking price. If you want a vanilla orchid perfume that has real depth and interest, try Vanilla Orchid by Precious Liquids. I have several samples of that and am considering a full size. I'm not a huge vanilla lover but that perfume will get you what you want in a floral/orchid vanilla fragrance. This one here falls flat.",07/07/22 10:41,LSAUG

Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"I second thingnanimose about the young wood and vanilla impressions. A facet of vanilla that we don't much get to experience, more floral and less edible.

Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"This is amazing! It is non-sweet vanilla, at least sweetness is not in the focus, but its delicate spiciness, its woodiness, its mysterious fresh floral hue and even freshness. It is also buttery. If you seek only gourmand side, this one might be a bit too spicy for you, but not for me. Spices make it cozy, a pinch of pepper in the top give this delicate vanilla a bit of texture. This is vanilla masterpiece. Do you remember Vanille Noire Yves Rocher? There is a familiar butter-fresh-woody nuance.",09/22/21 19:20,jeca
Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"As a vanilla lover, this frag has a uniqueness that kept me smelling my wrist all afternoon. It almost has a slight saltiness at the opening. Then it blossoms into a gorgeous floral vanilla. Its sweet but not too sweet, floral but not headache-y, and serious enough for a 40 years old who wants to be seen as feminine but firm and young enough for a 80 year old to lure a flirty suitor. After two or three hours it melts into the skin offering a tease of vanilla here and there as you go about your day. By the fifth hour it becomes a skin scent that's a bit spicy but sweet enough that it leaves your partner wanting bite into you. This is the most unique vanilla I own and I am so glad I blind bought! I dare say that this could be a signature scent due to its lack of popularity. - just my two (s)cents. hehe",08/31/21 16:20,YaaYaas2scents

Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"I’m so surprised with this perfume. Many people I know told me to skip it and go for Kayali or Vanilla Woods. I have yet to get my hands on Kayali but I can say this smells nothing like vanilla woods - thankfully. This to me smells like warm cookies from a French bakery but that’s not all it smells like, it also has smooth woody & floral notes. These do not smell like run of the mill floral notes. I assume this is the orchid that’s mentioned in the description. Although I said this smells like a cookie it doesn’t smell very sweet. I showered after trying this on and still smell it albeit a skin scent. I am definitely buying a full bottle of this and I’m not mad at the price point for a 5 oz bottle - you can tell the ingredients are high quality.",05/24/21 19:46,JaeIsFancy
Vanilla Planifolia Chloé,"I blind bought this fragrance, because I couldn't find any reviews and not many notes are listed, that alone made this fragrance a mysterious one.

I think this fragrance is a flowery, spicy, clean yet a little bit animalic in the dry down.
In the opening I percive something green.....maybe green cardamom and some pepper .....and maybe I'm crazy but when I spray it I think it has the tiniest bit of pear mixed with dill and a citrus or something sour (this I get for only 5-7 min). The opening I don't like that much but after 10-15 min, I love it.
Then it has something flowery (I'm not saying it is magnolia, but something reminiScent to that.. like it says on the packaging .. ""almost carnal flower"") and maybe nutmeg and a little bit of cinnamon and then it turns into a mysterious, addictive and sensual fragrance(but also somehow with a sobriety to it)

There is something special in the dry down. It is mysterious, elegant with a hint of an animalic note and a little bit of sweetness .
It worked realy well with my skin and I could smell this fragrance for about 9 hours on my skin and in my hair even longer. For me it is a skin scent.

If it has vanilla pod, it is a subtle one and it is present in the dry down because it has a hint of sweetness it.(But it could also be tonka)

I percive something similar to the spices in ""Intoxicated"" by Kilian but Vanilla Planifolia is a skin subtle scent and could be worn throughout the entire year.(It is just similar to the spices)

The description on the packaging of the fragrance is spot on.

I'm happy that I bought it.",11/26/20 15:40,DiscoveringScents

Love Story Eau de Toilette Chloé,"The EDT is lovely. Fresh and considerably lighter than EDP and Eau Sensuelle - this is a perfect office/daytime/warm weather fragrance. There is nothing offensive here. This is a straightforward soapy floral that has that pretty Chloe trademark to it. I bought mine directly from Chloe so I know my bottle is authentic. If your EDT is a scrubber yet you love EDP I would consider questioning authenticity because the EDT is a safe blind buy and is very similar to the EDP just slightly more effervescent.

Love Story Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I was today years old when I found out there was an EDT & an EDP. I had to go get my bottle to see what I had. I have the EDP, but I'm down a rabbit hole trying to find out the difference. Then I saw above where most don't see a difference. Hmmm...anyway, I've always said my EDP smells like gain detergent to me. In a good way. I do not get BBW Sweet Pea tho.
I have NEVER, NEVERRRR smelled such a complete difference in an EDT & EDP. EDT smells like rancid glue. NASTY! This should not have even been given the name ""Love Story"" b/c if someone tried this first, they would never in a million years try the EDP. This EDT was a scrubber & it was so bad I couldn't get it off of me & was scrubbing lotion into my skin. HORRID!",06/10/24 15:59,Nataliemarie
Love Story Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This is one of my best dumb-reach summer perfumes. I was disappointed when I got it initially, it seemed quite sharp at the opening and reminded me a bit of BBW's Sweet Pea fragrance. But as the weather warmed, I started to really enjoy it. I applied last week and even though it's very much winter, I kept getting lovely whiffs of it through the day. Very clean, soft after initial spray, and approachable. I feel put together when I wear it.
Edit: I love nasturtium and grow it en masse in my garden - I don't really detect it here - instead I get a staid and slightly sharp floral note that I associate with freesia - may be the plum blossom?",01/11/24 16:46,Indignatious83

Very office friendly, safe to blind buy or as a gift.

I believe it's simply taking the musk, rose, and plum blossom this long to fully bloom on my skin - pun intended.

Love Story Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I don't smell much of the listed notes in this. It's a very floral, clean scent, but it smells more like a abstract waxy white petal mix than realistic orange or plum blossoms. A little creamy, but unfortunately also a little scratchy. All on a base of laundry musk that intensifies in the drydown.

For my personal taste this fragrance is too clean, cold and nondescript. Not unpleasant, but not what I imagine when I think of a true ""love story"" - it's missing a spark of passion and excitement. It's more like an innocent crush that never leads anywhere.
This would be appropriate for days when you just want to smell clean and fresh, and it's relatively long-lasting for this kind of scent. But to be honest I think there are many better, equally easy-to-wear options in this category.
No idea how this compares to the EDP as I haven't tried it.",06/05/20 09:51,SailorV
Love Story Eau de Toilette Chloé,"The opening is a bit alcoholic, them it turns into a warm and slightly sweet soap with a touch of powder.

Love Story Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This fragrance has become a new found love for me. Being a fragrance lover and suffering from allergies and hay fever this summer has not been a good combo for perfume! Many fragrances regardless of how light have become nauseating, and have led to multiple sneezing which isn't pretty. I was sent a sample of the EDP and liked it, but felt something was missing. I generally have noticed that I tend to prefer EDT's mostly over EDP anyway. On a brave whim I bought Love Story EDT and boy am I happy!

Love Story EDT is as soft as a silk or cashmere scarf. Ever so lightly, it does not have heavy silage, but it's soft silage lasts a very long time which is just perfect for me. Bottled in a sleek bottle with a lovely pink bow tied to the side, this fragrance evokes the feeling of fresh clean white sheets to me.

Love Story Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I thought this was going to be exactly the same as Love Story EDP, but I was WRONG. It's softer, sweeter, and prettier, in my opinion.

The EDP is beautiful, but it has a hint of the floral sharpness in the original Chloe (rose) that gives me a slight headache.

This one doesn't.

The opening is soft and sweet, like a toned-down (and slightly muskier) Prada Candy Florale. But as it dries down, the orange blossom that makes Love Story EDP so unique shines through. It's still sweet, but the citrusy white floral begins to warm up.

The dry down stays quite true to this sweet orange blossom, but melts into your skin with the most beautiful musk.

I would attribute the sweetness that sets this apart from the EDP to the Plum Blossom, and a sweet rose note.

Someone said this smells like Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet, which I also love. I disagree that they smell the same, at all, but there is a similar tone. Both are sophisticated, but in a gentle, floral, breezy way.

Then I put it on, and waited. After a minute I realized that this is one of the weaker ones, so I'll have to sniff my wrist to check the progress of the scent.

At first I smelled overwhelming sweetness. I was waiting for some flowers to appear out of that, and eventually they did, but the sweetness lingered.

Unfortunately for Chloe Love Story EDT, I don't like overly sweet perfumes. I am able to overcome my dislike if the rest of the scent is really interesting. This one, however, isn't.

Love Story Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Glad to see I'm not the only one who thinks this smells like Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet. Upon first spray I just thought it was nice but a few minutes later I kept sniffing my wrist. It smells so good I had to close my eyes to smell it just to take it all in. Then I thought this smells very similar to Blooming Bouquet. It's a soft feminine floral scent. Office safe. Something to wear on a day to day basis without offending anyone around you. I don't own it yet but it is on my wish list. I'm not in a hurry to buy because the few times I have tested it, it didn't last very long. Unfortunately, lasting power is as minimal as Blooming Bouquet. If I see it online for a decent price I'll be sure to grab it. For now I'll just enjoy it by stealing a few sprays when I visit the mall.",06/08/16 13:31,rumari47
Love Story Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I got a sample of this yesterday and have been wearing it since. It was bugging me to no end that I recognized the fragrance but could't put my finger on it until I finally got it.

It's really similiar to Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet.

But while MDBB turns into a very sharp washing detergent smell on my skin, Love Story is more floral and fresh and not detergent-y at all.

But in the end, I still prefer the regular Chloé EdP. I would not buy a full bottle of Love Story, but would not say no if I was offered it as a gift.

EDIT: I cannot stop wearing this. I honestly don't want to wear anything else right now. Will buy a FB of this sweet floral gem.",06/01/16 04:13,snel hest
Love Story Eau de Toilette Chloé,"LOVE story indeed. The perfume surround you in flower Shell without spreading their heavy sweetness. My skin keeps the orange blossom but most of all, the plum blossom. The feeling that lasts on me is a feeling of a creamy,hidratated skin. Unlike the EDP, EDT does not last as long but it opens much quickly as a smell and it îs very fresh. I won't mention the bottle which looks fantastic. Love Story is floral perfume for summer, playful and feminine. I recommend it.",05/28/16 11:02,geanina_gandac

On me the opening it´s harsh......yes,but sooo fresh floral opening with green notes,like a fresh cutt grass with orange blossom.After a few minutes the orange blossom is very intensive but there is somenthing creamyness which I like.My skin just love it.I have to say that it´s waaay better than Love Story EDP(on me of course).I feel like a real and beautiful women in a white lace dress in a meadow where Bella & Edward was(around me are flowers).I will buy a big bottle,because the bottle is just soo feminine,romantic,and it´s very Chloé.
Now I´m in love. <3 <3 <3",05/17/16 09:26,Berta15

These were amongst my first perfume purchases when I started work in my early 20's and I could finally afford to buy ""grown up perfume"" in Boots or Superdrug.
A beautiful symphony of apricot, jammy florals and I get a greeness that turns what is essentially a bouquet of synthetic flowers into something quite magnificent.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"The EDP version was my signature scent throughout the 90's an into the early 2000's until it was discontinued.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"My love for life, together with Very Valentino edt and edp. I use it since I smelled it on my friend who sprayed it in her neck. 1993 I think it was. I wanted to walk behind her forever. It smells different on different parts of my body. And the best moment is when I shower, as then I get this voluptuous, sweet, full bodied blast of warmth around me due to Narcisse. Delicious.

I spray it on 20 minutes before I leave the door, otherwise I fumigate people. But in the morning when I think: ‘is today a Narcisse day…?’ I smell the nozzle, sigh, and if it is, I am in heaven for the rest of the day.
Also, a compliment getter, from women mostly. It gets better during the day, it softens.
But for the prices it sells now, I would not purchase it.

I am using the reformulated one at the moment, the darker brown one. It is different, but still a good rendition.

Narcisse has lived in my olfactory memory for years and I never forgot it due to its beauty and sheer strength. I was extremely happy when I found an excellent clone (Perfume Parlour UK) that smells identical and performs like an absolute beast.

This is a stunning floral bomb with gorgeous honeyed fruits. It's luscious, syrupy and literally dripping in wanton suggestion.

Too bad perfume pirates have decided to rob us for a fragrance that has been discontinued. The people who bought this fragrance were not rich people who were going to spend $500 on a bottle of perfume so instead of letting people enjoy the last bottles of it, they're going to hoard them till they expire and be stuck with old, expired perfume that nobody wants and THEN they'll sell it to you for an appropriate amount.

It’s definitely a strong and vintage fragrance and not for everyone, but for some reason I’ve always had a fondness for those types of fragrances.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"One spray lasts all day! Beautiful but heavy and heady. Opens with syrupy apricot, and then develops into green florals (especially the daffodil/narcissus note). Green florals v. golden fruit. Nothing shy about this one. I do feel the similarities with Spellbound, but that one is sweeter while Narcisse is greener.

Nothing new today smells like Narcisse. It's so opposite to all that trends today...so of course I adore it. My bottle is at least ten years old, maybe older - I have owned it for ten years. Age improves this, so don't shy away from buying old stock. Sublime sweet floral, not cold and green the way narcissus typically smells, more sweet and green/gold. More like a candied narcissus.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Scored a bottle of this. Oftentimes with ""legendary status"" discontinued perfumes I'm skeptical of how true that remembrance might be.
Something being not readily available anymore or linked to joyful memories of the past might be not remembered as accurately and fall into the grandiose and ethereal field of descriptions from people when in reality that something was just ""good"", or ""great"". I'm guilty of doing that many times with many cosmetic products, not just perfume.

This is in fact quite gorgeous though. And subtly ethereal yeah, I'd say.

There is a lot of emphasis here on the strength of it and I can't say I think it is particularly ""risky"" to overspray or be obnoxious.
It is strong, it does last quite long, but unless I'm noseblind wearing it now, I mostly get wafts from my clothes when I do movements from time to time only, not really a dangerous or headachy scent I think. I sprayed about 8-10 times, maybe a little more.

There's a certain note, not really sure which one out of the lot that reminds a lot of 90's plastic dolls and such items. Novelty store smell. I don't mean that in any detrimental way though, it manages to be that and also quite classic and refined at the same time.

I can't make out any peaches or apricots. It is a rubbery-flowery smell basically, but zen, level headed and not cheap smelling.

I can't make out daffodil either, despite being the namesake of the perfume. It's just a nebulous kind of flowery. I think certain eraser pens from the 90s smelled a lot like this, if that perhaps helps you get a better idea of what I'm referring to.

I have never seen ""tolu balsam"" in any other pyramid, call me uncultured, but I guess that could be the rubbery effect I get? I guess resiny, balsamy applies as a descriptor too.

If anything I think I make out the carnation, it is a softened carnation, not pungent or overtly green or spicy, although I do enjoy that pungent-ness from a real life carnation. That's not present, for the relief of the many haters out there.
Other than that maybe the pineapple, but it's a borderline gone bad pineapple, you now sliiightly alcoholic, sweet.

It's a gorgeous scent, I lf I were limited to one word to describe it would be ""charming""",11/04/23 19:05,Magnapinna

Ostara, however, starts with a photorealistic representation of the first daffodils of an early Spring morning; Chloe Narcisse starts out much more abstract then takes on the guise of a daffodil laden garden after a long dry hot day.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"This perfume is the first perfume I remember falling in love with when I was about 13 years old. My auntie wore it and my teacher wore it and it was one of those perfumes that was just instantly recognisable, you stood out from the crowd wearing this, it just smelt like heaven to me. I remember my auntie buying me a bottle for Christmas one year and the joy when I opened it, I finally had my very own bottle I was in awe of it lol I wore it every day for school and was the envy of everybody. It didn't last long and I remember saving all my pocket money and buying another bottle, then another and another, it became my signature Scent. You could get it in home and bargain for about £10 at the time and I stocked up. Fast forward nearly 10 years I forgot all about it until I was moving house and found a brand new unopened bottle and the memories came flooding back, it still smelled so good. By now I had a son and he used to cuddle up on my knee and sniff my jumper whilst going asleep and then started to spray it on his Teddy bear to cuddle when he went to bed he loved it as much as I did and then I ran out and tried to purchase a new bottle to find it had been discontinued 😭 I was devestated and I still am. I just recently came across a few over priced bottles on ebay, I'm currently saving up and going to treat myself for my birthday and even though my son is 21 now he still has that same Teddy bear he now uses as a pillow 😂 and I am going to spray the Teddy for him for old times sake 😂.
This perfume is intoxicating. Heady floral, creamy, warm and the smell literally fills the room. I think you either love it or hate it, it's a love for me even though it's nothing like anything else I wear. I now only usually buy gourmand perfumes but this will an exception.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Wearing this tonight, layered with a bit of Jonquille de Nuit. I remember reading about this being discontinued, so googled it to see what it's selling for ... I only have half of my 50mL bottle left, and that makes me super sad. However, I don't wear it too often so I can be reasonably happy I still have ~30mL.

Chloé Narcisse is a 90s floral, through and through. It being discontinued isn't a total surprise as it isn't exactly ""current"" or ""with it"". I don't know how well it sells, but I imagine it wouldn't be as good a seller as it was; this is disappointing.

This is less a scent for warm spring days, and more a scent for cool autumn afternoons. Stone fruits, white and yellow flowers, and a woody vanilla dry down. Feels in line with fragrances like Charlie Gold (but a lot more refined). The comparisons to Diamonds and Emeralds/Sapphires are apt. A very similar vibe. I don't think there's a person that this is too old for, or too young for. This could very easily suit anyone. However, in saying that, anyone who wore this would probably need to appreciate that this isn't going to be the smell of 2022. Very lovely, but not timeless... let's not kid ourselves.",10/08/22 04:31,DT953

The pic here is of the newer, reformulated Coty one (that no longer as the green stem like PI and Unilever had), which was a relatively late development, and could still be bought at drug stores and TJ Maxx as of 4 or 5 years ago. The reformulated version indeed had a darker color to start with, not a sign that it was turned. Compare the bottles in the ""fragram"" section. It's a consistent feature.

This was one of my ""use up the sample/travel size/decant but don't buy more"" fragrances; there've been a lot of those in my life!

I do remember that it lasted for quite a few hours on my dry, perfume eating skin. I don't remember if it was the EDT or the EDP, but I assume it was the EDP since it lasted so well.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I get that there are those of us who enjoyed this fragrance and miss it, but is it really enough to justify the exorbitant prices at which it's being sold on EBay? Like others, I'm perplexed. Especially since it doesn't have a particularly high rating here.

This was my first ""nice"" perfume like a few others who've posted. Before this all I could afford was Body Shop oils and the odd travel-size sampler. ;-) I definitely bought it in large part because of the beautiful bottle. On me, I remember this being rich verging on too rich. A floral and fruity bomb. And even then, it was a bit too floral / sweet, without enough of something contrasting, to be a real love. But I liked it, and I don't know what happened to my bottle. Most likely I donated it to Goodwill at some point, which I'm now regretting. I'd love to smell it / try it out now and see what my reaction is. But at the prices it's going for, alas, looks like this won't be happening!",07/19/22 13:30,ajraccounts
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"My very fist signature scent at 16. It may have been a bit heady for a teenager but I wore it everyday with abandon and confidence.

That spicy, sweet floral with a touch of powder was just IT for me. I layered with the shower gel, lotion and dusting powder. I'm sure you could smell me into next semester. But I was, and still am in love.

I'm not sure how many bottles of this I've been through. I remember being gifted extras at Christmas time during several different years back then.

I've got one large bottle I'm currently using and one small one stashed in the closet. I sometimes contemplate buying more at the ridiculous prices offered now as I just can't imagine not having this in my scent wardrobe.

I've got a million other scents these days, but Chloe Narcisse will always be my first fragrance love.",07/17/22 10:54,Diamondsarahb

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I mourn the passing of 80s and 90s powerhouse Perfumes!!!! How I loved this beast and wore it until I ran out recently.

The first spray is harsh yellow flowers with spicy carnation and apricot, a sort of greenish spicy blast but the dry down on this is complex and unique, as well as very pleasing to the nose. Rose, yes, it's there, fruit, off course, white and yellow flowers and a yummy balsamic note. It is a confident scent which makes no excuses, no apologies and takes no prisoners. It can fill a room for hours. Spillage and longevity are amazing but, this used to sell as a low end scent. Now it is a sought after, niche, scent and will set you back a fair bit.

For those of us who grew up with Perfumes like these, Houbigant's Rafinee, Chloe Narcisse, Oscar de la Renta's Volupte, 'O' de Lancome, the original female Aqua de Gio, Dior Addict (original), Lancome's Magie Noir, the only man still standing is Calvin Klein's Obsession, which I still wear although reformulated and toned down a tad.

Wouldn't it be great to have some of the available, even as limited editions. Especially this confident lady!!!!!!!!",05/06/22 03:54,AlexandriaCleopatra
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,Guys when did this perfume become so expensive?? I remember buying this just 7 years ago for 20 bucks for a huge bottle. Now these bottles are hundreds of dollars. That’s scary. And a bit sad. I agree with the poster who said this smells like Rapture. Both juices have that heavy syrupy fruit smell that is so unique to the 90’s.,05/04/22 12:55,sweetvanilladreams
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"An exquisite fruit salad; a thick nectar of fresh orange and yellow fruits arranged on a pink flower bed.

Narcisse is truly distinctive in both its potency and '90s beauty. There is something synthetic about Narcisse's colourful bouquet which, in truth, I really quite like -- this elemental presence ties the rich variety of its notes rather harmoniously.

I was clumsy enough to spill several drops of this on a table surface, some years ago; it then saturated the better part of some fabric: the lingering aroma (dare I say that it never really disappeared?) is indelibly impressed in my olfactive memory like a luscious and syrupy stain. Chloe's vintage creation is everything that modern Chloe is not, and cannot be: boisterous, flamboyant, audacious and, above everything, unique.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I wore this one a lot in my early 20s, and oh boy, did I love this baby! And although it's unmistakably vintage, people would often tell me I smelled really nice.

So yeah, it's a classy late 80s / early 90s bold spicy floral, with such a rich composition and so many notes it's difficult to make out what they all are exactly. It's also kind of ""dusty"" and slightly medicinal in an intriguing way, that's really the part that makes it apparent which era it comes from.

In spite of its age, Narcisse doesn't feel ""old"" to me. It's retro but in a romantic and youthful way. It'll make you feel like you're a charming 80s film heroine, not like you're wearing your grandma's fragrance. A great choice for younger vintage lovers! As for myself, I think it used to fit my style and personality way better when I was 20, but fast forward 10 years, and now I'm just not a vintage girl anymore. I thoroughly enjoyed it back then, though. Good times, good times.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Probably the heaviest perfume I've ever come across, above preformulated Alien, above La vie est Belle. Blind bought it back when I was clueless about fragrances and didn't know what to expect, was in my early 20s and this perfume was wayy too mature for me, it's just too much in every way. It has a loud narcissus smell, accompanied by a heavy and dark sweetness. I've tried putting a tiny amount on my wrist to get more casual whiffs of it, but the scent itself is just heady. Before going to work I've sprayed this only twice, and my coworker who was driving me had to open the car window IN WINTER lmao, scent filled the entire car in minutes. So I ended up giving this to my mother who loves heavy loud perfumes, she used it up. If you get a headache easily, this isn't for you. However for those who do love this type of scent, this powerhouse is more than worth what you pay for it, and the botte is very lovely too.",02/24/22 11:53,Rober7a

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Chloe Narcisse? Let’s sum it up in four words: stunning, flowery, unique, STRONG! 💖 This fragrance is one of the longest-lasting and most intoxicating scents in my collection, right up there with Dior's powerful Dune and Merveilles Hermès.

And let me tell you, layering it is a no-go—it’s so strong that it completely drowns out anything else. Is it like Tresor? Not even close! Tresor is all about that ripe apricot vibe, while Narcisse is a lush green daffodil flower infused in a sugary syrup elixir, with just a hint of apricot and peach. No other scent can match the room-filling sweet bomb that is Chloe Narcisse!

I’ve seen some comparisons floating around, and they are way off base. This beauty hasn’t found a serious clone yet! If I had to pick something that’s somewhat similar, I’d say Nicole Miller, but it’s more of a plum thing that misses the sugar heavy sweetness that Narcisse delivers. Liz Taylor’s Emeralds touches on some similar notes, but the overpowering gardenia takes over from start to finish.

This fragrance is one of a kind! I’ve got a stash of backup bottles I’ll never part with (never ever), thanks to my local chemist practically giving them away! The name Chloe Narcisse really fits—it’s practically an elixir! The strength of this EDT is a nod to the lost art of perfumery, like Byzance, Sicily, and the original Mania. I give it a full 20/10 for both scent and performance! I don’t throw those scores around lightly! 🌟

Wear what you want. No labels needed.",12/29/21 21:22,OceanPlusEarth
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I can see why some reviewers compare Narcisse with Poeme, but i believe they start and go in different direction eventhough they share some similarities especially the sweet flower bomb notes.

Both Narcisse and Poeme are intense, complex, and definitely a statement. While Poeme started with strong yet delicate honeyed sweet floral, Narcisse would bomb you with flowers, spices, and balsamic note since the first spray. Head-aching, possibly. Apricot, peach, and pineapple joined the party later, when the spices and florals frenzy have calmed down a bit. The transition phase did remind me with my eternal love, Poeme, but without the game changer honey and mimosa.

Narcisse has a light powdery drydown, still super sweet, a bit spicy, slightly musky, and balsamic (the balsamic note’s always there all the time). Sandalwood’s presence only in the final phase.

I think it’s a grandeur floriental perfume, i really like it and appreciate its existence.",09/29/21 03:55,dualaokto

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Flowery-fruity scent. This is a true 90's scent when floral scent was quite fierce and strong. At some point it indeed makes me feel that I've bended my head into a huge narcissus bouquet. A bit synthetic, but this resembles me that naive, high school mindset (a time when I wore quite synthetic fragrances) when the World seemed to be missing me, I would never fail, my life would go only up for me, I would never face difficulties :). Maybe the resemblance of this positivity is why I love it so much... Considering Chloe as a brand this is the only perfume I truly like from them, as they are too earthy, ozonic, green for me.
Anyway, Narcisse would go in my ""classy and feminine"" perfume shelf along with Jean Patou ""Joy"", Guerlain's ""Champs Elysees"", Lalique's ""Nilang"" and Bill Blass ""Nude"".",03/04/21 12:07,Lollia007

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I’ve had this is my collection for about 25 years and have worn it perhaps a dozen times. I’ve hung on to it mostly because of the cute bottle. I’ve always been intimidated by the opening. A bouquet of screechy flowers all vying for attention encased in a cheap plastic vase emitting petrol fumes. At least, that was my (partially true) long-held perception.
I was clearly missing out. The angry floral notes gradually calm down. The peach, which imparts a bit of the plastic quality, ripens right on the skin. This is a forerunner to Gucci Rush, less lactonic, more floral but full of tangy, peachy heft and smoothness. I agree with what many other reviewers have noted: it takes time to understand this one. Now that I’ve learned how to enjoy this, I will gladly wear it more often.",06/29/20 10:14,labonvie
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Drunk and screaming yellow flowers wrapped in plastic foil. This is quite the extreme scent on my skin.

I cannot make out the daffodils as such - just a generic smell of yellow flowers. If I had to guess, I would say it is mimosa. In nature, daffodils are sweet and fresh, but Narcisse shows no signs of freshness on me. While it certainly is very sweet, it is also quite oppressive. There is a sharp, almost piercing note to it, probably from the carnation and the spices. Also, a strong whiff of rum and of plastic. (I do not think my bottle has turned. I remember the smell from the 90s, and it was the same back then.)

Disclaimer: My skin is not apt for this kind of perfume, because carnation, yellow flowers and peaches often work against me. Narcisse is an intriguing and well-made scent with good sillage and longevity.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"This Chloe classic intimidates the hell out of me and I want to test her so badly. I can do vintage, but vintage yellow florals frighten me a little. Its decidedly deep golden juice in that petite, unassuming bottle with frosted lid with screams ""established classic yellow bomb!"" I've wanted a narcissus fragrance since late winter, just haven't decided which I'm ready to blind buy. Ostara, Jonquille De Nuit and Chloe Narcisse all sound very different from one another.

Wasn't this a drugstore cheapie not long ago? What I see online suggests it might be taking a turn down unicorn lane. Isn't that how it goes. I'll give my thoughts down the line if I decide to buy the darn thing already.",04/24/20 01:02,Swedelish
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"A little goes a long way. The first blast is heady and spicy-sweet. Like carnations dipped in apricot liqueur. Sweet and sour, then her dominant flower emerges. Narcisse is heady and “notice me,” like the iconic frags of the ‘80s. Nothing like the unisex or ozonic scents of the grunge and The Rachel era. Maybe she was a little late to the party but I find Narcisse the one you can’t wait to arrive: she is timeless, soigne, uplifting and memorable.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I love narcissus and this is one heady, intoxicating narcissus bomb. Luscious, honeyed and hyper feminine. It’s aided by a supporting cast of succulent peach/apricot (and pineapple), carnation, rose, gardenia, a touch of spice, and a dash of something bitter-green. There’s a beautiful vanilla in the drydown as well. Gosh, the trail of scent it leaves behind is just so seductive, alluring and unique. There is an addictive narcotic quality to the scent, I end up sniffing myself like a crazy person whenever I wear it. It envelops me in a sweet, heavenly scent cloud all day and I feel like everything is right with the world. Stock up if you come across it, because it is becoming increasingly hard to find. A must try for die-hard floral lovers. Narcisse is somewhat comparable to Poeme (that same honeyed floral sweetness), but Narcisse is more care-free and sensual, Poeme is her elegant older sister. Love them both, and they are on my ‘all-time favorites’ list, but I find that Narcisse has always been the better fit for my personality.
Edited to add: With the newer formulations, the sillage isn’t as enormous as it used to be. I got my first bottle as a gift from my aunt in 2008, I immediately loved it, but felt it too overpowering to comfortably wear back then, so it sat neglected at the back of my closet for a few years before I finally gave it away...so for me, the new formulation is a good thing!

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I love floral perfume, but the day I found this beauty, I realized I especially love spicy florals. Just that extra zing to complement the floral. I realized I adore narcisse. I wish I could smell that flower in real life. This is extremely gorgeous in cold weather. I feel blessed living in New York. I get all 4 wonderful seasons and I get to experience all different sorts of fragrances bloom within the seasons. There is nothing like this beautiful perfume on a fluffy sweater on a cold day. Be careful though to not overspray. I love pressing the sprayer for some reason on all my bottles haha. One day I over sprayed this because I love it so much. The top apricot note turned very sour and stayed for a long time. Finally an hour or more later, the rest of the perfume, base notes, finally shined. This is an older perfume, but everyone should experience this. It may take a while to appreciate it, but when you finally do you will never want to be without a bottle of this.

Edit: what is going on? I happened to look for this online and now it’s going for ridiculous prices. It’s so upsetting as just a couple years ago this was so affordable.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Probably my favourite fragrance of all time!

If gold was a perfume it would smell just like this - and I'm not referring to the 'white' variety - but the deep opulence of the yellow metal, with all the warmth of rose gold. And it's a delicious luxury too; not 'gourmand ' by any means, but a bright, flowery, balmy sweetness - almost like a gold nougat dipped in honey and laid beside a bed of clean, fragrant flowers when the sunshine is truly in its prime.

I love, love, love this fume, and I always will forever!

My love affair began when aged 19, I was gifted a bottle from my beautiful Aunt. She also loved this fragrance and still wears it to this day. At this time I was probably regarded as a little 'young' to be rocking Narcisse (I'm 38 now) however, I don't believe that a smell should be 'pigeon holed' based on age, and the amount of compliments I received from varying ages while wearing this, would belie that theory anyway.

Unfortunately, my nose isn't so trained as to distinguish particular notes; however, I can confirm that this is undeniably feminine, and as the description suggests, it is sweet with a slightly bitter note.

It is also worth mentioning that Coty 'weakened' the formula, because 10 years ago this really was a power house! Where as, now it only lasts a few hours on skin like most edt's. It is still the same fragrance - just weaker (either that or my nose is too accustomed to this fragrance).

I am devastated that you can no longer buy this for such reasonable digits, as the price has shot up on Amazon from £20 for 100ml to £70+ meaning that I can no longer afford to use this as my 'signature '.

In conclusion, this is truly narcotic, and I personally believe there's nothing quite like it. Younger girls do not be afraid to try this! You may be pleasantly surprised...",12/11/19 02:10,PrincessPongyPearls

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"It opens with a strange highly unpleasant synthetic note, probably cheap synthetic peach, because I smell the same in Chopard Casmir and EA Sunflowers. If you have the patience to wait for half an hour, it first starts turning into a honey scent - I even thought it would go in the direction of Lancome Poeme. But it doesn't quite get there and turns fruity instead. Funnily, it smells like an older sister of Joop All about Eve to me - I smell apple and vanilla. But it's probably sweet peach + sour pineapple playing tricks on me. The drydown is delicious and rich, I even turned around and went back to the shop to buy Narcisse two hours after the first test. But then I sprayed it again, smelt the top notes again - and no, yuck, no thanks. I really hope the tester was off or that particular version. I want that beautiful drydown!",06/13/19 13:34,Molly Smith
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"An I ntense sweet floral, very sunny. I am addicted to the drydown. I have narcissus essential oil (very sweet, greenish smell), and the most prominent note here is definitely that, so it is aptly named. I also smell fruit notes (apricot) giving the scent a warm, syrupy quality, green balmy notes add depth, vanilla makes it seductive, soft spices to make it sparkle, and other floral notes (rose, gardenia) to enrich the bouquet. It's extremely feminine, ‘perfumey’ and very optimistic. Too few perfumes out there with narcissus as a star note, so this is one of my favorites for that reason. 'Narcisse' and 'Love, Chloe' are 2 of Chloe's best fragrances imo. Different smells, opposite in personality, but both unique, both distinctive and both give off a warm, retro-feminine vibe. Because of its intensity, you only need 2-3 sprays, and give it up to an hour to develop on your skin. You will smell delicious all day. It smells dated, yes, but smells so good and is unique enough that you'll have people asking you what you're wearing regardless. I prefer it for winter, early spring/late fall, possibly on breezy summer evenings...it can get cloying and smell like air freshener in the heat, so watch out. If this scent was a woman, she would probably be Sofia Vergara in a colorful sundress showcasing her curves, strappy heels, flower in her hair, and she has a fruity cocktail in one hand... loads of fun, sensuous, womanly, happy. I can also imagine Marilyn Monroe smelling like this, feminine, playful and highly seductive, but more lady than tramp. Not everyone's cup of tea this scent, and some may find it OTT and garish, but I personally dig it.",06/12/19 22:42,Bambi.fq
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"My first reaction to this was that it was pleasant but not something I would become fond of . I thought I might use it to layer with another scent .

After wearing it twice I have become enamored with Chloe Narcisse and see why it has has endured for many years. It is classically feminine , and a spicy floral with GREAT longevity . It is also a scent that would be hard not to like. I find I grow more fond of it ever time I wear it . There are times it makes me think it could be a distant relative to Kenzo Jungle ( L’Elephant) with the spices and mixed floral notes and colorful statement .

I do not smell narcisse , but I do smell a spicy feminine scent that is one of a kind and also rather comforting . If you like spicy scents that are a bit traditional and feminine , you should try this. It is an older scent , but I have had SEVERAL compliments while wearing it this past year . I have a friend who is also buying it after smelling it on me a few times. This is a well made perfume.",06/08/19 00:09,annxyz
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Going by reviews stating that this as a powerhouse coupled with my own wariness of spice, I was afraid this was going to be super heavy and strong. I spritzed carefully just once and had to have more, and more.. The spice is not cloying, but balances the juicy, sweet fruit with warmth and depth. The lightest touch of powder counters a syrup-like feel, while the flowers are smooth and colorful. It makes me think of fruit-infused tea being poured over a tall glass of ice while outside on a hot summer day. Dew is running down the side of the glass and flowers are blooming all around, backed by dark green trees. I do get bubblegum-powder and it is divine! Narcisse manages to combine a bright world of sun-warmed flowers with deep dusk and shadow.

5 yr update: My bottle has matured so that this smells like a spicy bubblegum with overripe florals. Rather fluffy. Still loving it!",05/31/19 13:55,honeybelle
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"It was a blind buy,the worst one ever ...

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,Heads up..I've already heard twice from fragrantican's this has been discontinued so i feel it necessary to let others know as well..if it has been discontinued go and get at least one bottle..it's nice enough and the bottle is very pretty..the same bottle but the stem that is green all the way to the bottom are the best versions of this whether the smaller bottle or the taller bottle if they have the green stems all the way down those are better formulations of this..and yes this has been reformulated..i have a newer bottle but its not that bad..I talk about this below,02/03/19 10:19,ForrealMe2
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Although this fragrance has been reformulated and I had an original bottle before..it's still lovely and bold as ever..and only 10% less of what it was..the original bottle i had that was older had a green nozzle and tube that went all the way down through the vase to the bottom of the bottle so that it looked like a real flower and the smell you smell was usually more dense and juicy..it's the same fragrance just a little less of it's self..it wasn't too far off where i couldn't enjoy it so i am happy it wasn't a really bad reformulation..if this has been discontinued you have to at least have owned this once because the scent is nice enough if you love orange blossom and the bottle is so pretty..it's a strong 90's perfume so its loud and long-lasting.. worth every penny and its a very very close orange blossom perfume if you know the plant..if you love the vibe of 90's perfumes..you will love this...its sunny, it's bright, it's floral, it's sweet but not gourmand sweet..and it's mature..but i think any age can pull this off...a day time spring or winter scent because of how powerful it is..",01/10/19 20:02,ForrealMe2

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"After several testings. I finally get what Narcisse is about on a cold autumn evening.. I tried on warmer day's and for some reason it was fleeting, but now I definitely get a peachy, pineapple sweetness that reminds me of KLs Sun, Moon and Stars.. In fact I swear there's tuberose in it or at least something echoes the note with great similarity..Its not something I would reach for everyday, but I definitely appreciate it when I am in the mood for sweet something's.",11/06/18 13:24,amanda-m-lewis
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I remember absolutely LOVING this fragrance in the late 90’s. I repurchased a bottle for nostalgia and either they reformulated or my nose did a 180. It’s a strong, cloying, hot mess of a fragrance on me now.",10/24/18 16:13,elmccullar

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"At this period 92, Karl Lagerfeld was artistic director of Chloé.
I notice similarity with Creation de Lapidus with bubblegumy note (frangipani and vanilla).

Stop your perpetual ""very feminine"" comments !

I see Isabelle Adjani in 'l' été meurtrier' or Christian Bale as well in ""American psycho'.(what a nevrotic reference!)",08/09/18 05:31,saintlunaire
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Sweet and sharp at the same time, Narcisse isn't shy about pronouncing its presence. I don't get bubble gum, but I do get aldehydes. It reminds me of Ysatis, which has the same strength and longevity.

A little goes a long way, a lot might be over powering.
Narcisse is a well made fragrance that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's definitely feminine, even a little girly, but it's not cheap or brash. I like it!",07/27/18 14:15,Phantomias
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,Flowers with balls! Gutsy floral which I’ve always loved. I typically only wear this when I’m not planning on being around anyone. Too many people are sensitive to perfume today and I think this one would definitely set someone off. But I love it!,07/21/18 10:32,fumongous

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"*sniff sniff* ""you smell good"" *sniff sniff sniff* ""you smell really good what is it?""
Are the exact things my partner said & did.
I had 5 sprays of Pink sugar (which happens to be his favourite, on my top) and 1 spritz of Chloe narcisse on the right side of my neck.
Yes I like to mix up my scents, not always though.
I giggled and said ""it's Pink sugar"" he responded ""nah it's not"" he then stuck his face into my neck and said ""THIS ONE""!!!
5 sprays of Pink sugar & 1 single spritz of Narcisse... Guess which one got his attention? That's right Chloe did.
To my surprise he liked it, a lot too.
I love this myself, guess I'll be needing another bottle as it's almost finished.",06/30/18 13:55,Selena
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"When I first tried this, my brain immediately connected to the opening of Revlon Fire and Ice. But Narcisse is greener, fresher, and less sickly in its intense sweetness. I must also get a lot of marigold on my skin, as portions of the dry down are vaguely reminiscent of Vera Wang Embrace Marigold and Gardenia. The last stage of this perfume loses all floral quality and consists of rich, non-plastic vanilla with a tiny smidge of animalic warmth. I’m falling in love with this scent, so much so that I’m finding it difficult to wear anything else. If I’m going to be in an environment in which sillage would be frowned upon, I put one spray on a Q-tip and dab that on my pulse points. It dries down to mostly base notes within an hour, and then it doesn’t spread or offend.",06/25/18 21:38,SparrowLight1
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"A bubblegum-y sweet bright floral, very early 90s.. I feel like Barbie would wear this.. when I close my eyes I see fuschia lipstick, hot pink leg warmers and platinum blond crimped hair. I love it!! Great nostalgia scent, still wearable because it's just so fun and uplifting.",06/01/18 23:24,greyhoundmom
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Spring often makes me crave green scents, but when this year's long winter finally ended, it was decadent honeyed florals I found myself longing for. Narcisse is kind of hyped on Fragrantica, and it looked like it would be just the ticket, so when I discovered how cheaply it's available, I decided to break my ""no blind-buying"" rule. And I'm happy to report that for once I didn't regret it: this is all I was hoping for and more.
I really like Narcisse's nineties vibe, from the colorful box and the neon green spraying mechanism to the sheer amount of notes listed in the pyramid, and of course the scent itself most of all. I grow daffodils every spring, and as far as I know they don't have any particular scent, but I have no trouble imagining they could or indeed should smell like Narcisse: bright, rich, sweet and honeyed without tending towards sugary, heady, slightly intoxicating. Lovely, and it easily lasts all day as well!
All in all this must be my most successful blind buy to date - it certainly fulfilled all my spring cravings for a great price, and although I find myself reaching for it less now that the summer heat is here, I'm sure it'll become a spring staple for me.",05/28/18 09:04,dsty

me- Narcisse?
Her- Ah yes; I’ve worn it for 40 years.

You go girl!

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Chloe Narcisse smells like daffodil flower, its leaves and stalks, I detect also apricots, poppy flower, tulips and frangipani. It's very sweet (cotton candy, honey), with almost aseptic undertones (a hospital - cresols are natural components of narcisse/daffodil essential oil) green, ""rainy"" fragrance, intoxicating, mesmerizing, narcotic, somnolent, sweet but poisonous, it smells ""80-ties"" but without being grannyish, very introvertic, with some dark depth, depressive, with an unbelievable lasting power.",04/27/18 12:02,justfloral
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"This is a bold, feminine, fun scent. Generous and full of amber-lit love and warmth, like sucking sweets on a warmer than usual spring day with a hand picked bouquet of spring daffodils and dirt on your knees, grass stains on your summer frock.

It smells like rubarb and custard hard boiled sweets we have here in the UK, but its not a gourmand by any means or a conventional sweet scent.

It opens beautifully, floral, sweet and spicy syrup and the dry down is a nice, slightly skanky skin scent thanks to the marigold and pepper. I tend to avoid sweet scents, but this won my heart from first spray.",04/27/18 06:13,SaturnSmiled
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Apricot carnations bed underneath a single narcissus flower and a 1 peach!

Narcissus being the dominant note here! that's false and i am sure it is voted that high cause narcissus is written on the bottle! It's apricots carnations, and peaches with hints of gardenia, spices, balsam, roses, sandalwood, and orange blossoms. It isn't gourmand cause i can't detect any foody or vanilla style thing as much as a soft apricots to softens the sharp carnation roses blend, and lightens the narcissus. It settles into slightly sharp rosy with hints of apricots and peaches.

The colder it goes the charmer it gets.. it's dry down is superbly alluring and gets balanced pretty good. Very good.",04/18/18 06:13,Q80

After seeing it recommended a lot I thought I’d give it a try. I absolutely love it! I get gorgeous apricot, peaches and carnation with just the perfect amount of spice, the other notes are there too but in a supporting role.

I tend to get a little spray happy with perfumes but trust me when I say a little goes a VERY long way.
I'm not one to easily get woozy from a scent but this one can really pack a punch
After testing this out on my wrist and a sniff every few minutes to see how the perfume has changed and I'm starting to feel a little dizzy lol
It's beautiful though
It's very spicy,very floral and with a hint of sweetness.

It's nice and strong, but I won't be buying this",01/18/18 19:22,Maryxcontrary
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I've loved this scent for the longest time. I was given a tiny bottle of it as a child in the 90s and it was a great treasure for me, the bottle was so pretty and I thought the smell was really nice. I didn't start actually wearing it until I rediscovered it in my 20s (it took a while to find out what it was called, all I could remember was the flower bottle!).
To me this is a very warm and heady, intoxicating floral fragrance. I wouldn't necessarily call it sexy, although some might see it that way. To me it's just a great fragrance to keep you warm when it's freezing cold outside.
This is also the most potent fragrance I've ever encountered. Even a tiny dab of it often gives me a headache a few hours later, spraying it would be lunacy. It really is extremely cloying and must be used carefully. I used to spray it in the air and walk through it, but I suspect even that might have been too much, I know I could smell it around me all day. Now I've tracked down a vintage deodorant version of it and I spray that in the air and walk through it - much better. I also keep a miniature bottle and sometimes use one microscopic dab of that.",01/14/18 06:15,kz
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"It's funny, but I seem to be able to sense a Grojsman composition easily these days, and I would put money on this one being one of hers. There are some vague resemblances in Chloe Narcisse to ET Diamonds & Rubies as well as to Boucheron Jaipur, but Narcisse is deliciously sweet (not in a gourmand way, but in a mouthwatering sweet-floral with fruity aldehyde way). There is, like in Diamonds & Rubies but much-more subtle, a note of celery-seed that puts an interesting and unexpected ""green"" facet on the fragrance... and the drydown- oh, so lovely. I can't think of much else to say that hasn't been said, but Narcisse is strikingly gorgeous!",01/08/18 09:09,Labaloo
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Ah, my beloved Narcisse. Contrary to popular opinion, this really isn't particularly floral to my nose; in fact, I'd say it's more of a fruity floriental.

Narcisse opens with bittersweet marigold, dewy green freshly-cut daffodil stems, a blast of tart pineapple and succulent peach. Once the brash opening dissipates and the fragrance blossoms, the pineapple vanishes, the peach becomes less prominent and the apricot takes center stage, joined by a velvety bouquet of carnations and soft spices that create a warm, decadently sweet & powdery aroma reminiscent of dried apricots and spiced fruit cocktails with a very photorealistic daffodil undertone that provides an intoxicating dewy sweetness that prevents Narcisse from being too dry.

Narcisse is a younger, wilder, exuberant and vibrant distant relative of Lancôme's Tresor; she has auburn hair and an unsurpassed joie de vivre.

This fragrance carries such warm memories for me and brings me unprecedented joy. If I am ever without Narcisse, I will feel as though a part of me is missing. Simply sublime.",01/02/18 14:38,Azula
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Like others, I bought this perfume on an impulse, it was a blind buy due to its low price and the good reputation of the Chloe house.

I'm not disappointed. I was expecting a more 90s sort of scent (I am a fan of 90s perfumes in general), but I would say this is not really the case. It is unique. Chloe has managed to create a floral-sweet fragrance that does NOT smell cheap. I think it may be the only one of this kind I have encountered so far. It is very feminine, very flattering. It takes a long time for it to completely dry down. As it does, the scent changes to a more refined, sophisticated one. Contrary to most reviews, I do not find it cloying or overpowering at all. Even the perfume's description here on Fragrantica cautions as to the strength of this fragrance. I would say don't worry about that.

This is a fragrance that seems to me to be perfect for younger women, in their twenties or early thirties. Not that it smells girlie, because that is not the case, but because it smells youthful, albeit refined. I would say this is THE fragrance for a sophisticated young woman who wants to avoid smelling like everyone else in her age group, but is not ready for heady orientals yet.",12/29/17 07:06,Orjen

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"This classic designer-gone-drugstore cheapie never appealed to me enough to try it, as I'm not much of a vintage lover in general and I think the old Chloé EDT smells dated and just not good. But I can appreciate a good 90s scent and like to try random cheap fragrances, so finally, I spontaneously sprayed Narcisse from a tester bottle. To my surprise I really like it! Also it feels familiar, I'm sure I smelled it on other people over the years.

It starts intensely fruity with lactonic apricot, peach and a punch of pineapple. I'm not even sure if pineapple really is an official note here, but I definitely smell it.
The fruity notes mix with lovely strong narcotic, hypnotic white and yellow floral notes, a hint of sweet vanilla and warm sandalwood. There is something old-school perfumey, slightly spicy in the background, could be carnation or marigold. It's not too much though, it keeps the fragrance from getting too cloying and makes it stand out among today's perfumes.
In the drydown Narcisse becomes softer and more vanillic, but still a bit floral and peachy.

This is such a sunny, happy perfume. A fruity floral that makes me think of sunshine and warmth. It's not a light summer fragrance, way too intense for that, just a bright and sweet mood lifter.",12/15/17 00:56,SailorV
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Every time I wear this scent, I smell a floral spicy version of fruit cocktail. You know, the kind we ate as kids in the 70's and early 80's, that had peach, pear, cherries, and heavy syrup. It is sweet, spicy, and decadently floral. The original formula EDP is my absolute favorite and in my Top 5 fragrances. It lasts for over 24 hours in my hair. Simply beautiful.",11/28/17 18:03,HennaQueen
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Narcisse is a very strong fragrance, one spray is sufficient. If your skin eats fragrance and perfume never lasts give Narcisse a try. If you find Narcisse too potent decant it into a perfume dab bottle. Applying it in small dabs the old-school way will reduce it's potency. I really like the spices and the carnation in this perfume. This scent has something so nostalgic about it, I must have smelled it on many women when i was a child in the 90's.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I have loved this gorgeous, potent Narcissus BOMB for years! The notes (for me) blend into one accord of delicate complexity with the narcissus as the most prominent note throughout CN's crazy-long life.
This perfume has a presence like no other, save perhaps Giorgio Beverly Hills' Giorgio, though they smell nothing alike other than the fact that both are quite floral, but in different ways.
Narcisse is absolutely beautiful. If you love uber-feminine FLORAL perfumes, this is one you'd be remiss to not try.
Chloe Narcisse is not only beautiful, but very high-quality and well-crafted as well. Sophisticated, feminine, powerful, breath-takingly beautiful.

Yes, it is pretty strong, but if sprayed a little bit it is a lovely inviting scent. One of the most frequent complains in this site about perfumes is how they are not strong enough.

Once the fruity sweetness tones down a bit, it becomes a rather heady floral. Very suitable for, well, any time really. You can wear it in the house, out of the house, morning or night, Spring or Winter.",06/20/17 09:06,cocolover56
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I was shopping and a woman passed me wearing a very unique, lovely, spicy fragrance- it reminded me of Lutens/Shiseido Feminite du Bois which I own, love and paid a good chunk of change for. The cedar and peach were there in warm, almost bitter, prominence. I lingered in the scent trail for a second then had to ask what she was wearing- and it was this. I can't speak to what it smells like up close, or how long lasting it is, but I can assure you that it will make total strangers ask what you are wearing :) Looks like it's very affordable too!",06/16/17 10:32,Violinplayah

This perfume is so beautiful all my friend say to me. Sweet fruit and flowers. The fruit is peach apricot very juicy delicious. The flowers I smell in this parfum is narcissus rose and carnation. There is cinnamon. I smell spices and incense. When she is dry the perfume is smelling like sandalwood and vanilla. Love the vanilla. This perfume is Oriental but she is soft powdery feminine. I wear this in the summer and is like cocktail! I wish I could drink this parfum. This perfume is good for wearing in day time with dresses and sandals to the beach.

Now I am not a fragrance expert by any means, so I couldn't detect any notes, but I really really like the scent! It's really pleasant :) It's sweet but not in a sickly way.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Gorgeous, sultry,spicy scent. This fragrance lends itself more during cooler temperatures; maybe it's the tolu balsam that makes me feel this way. Overall Chloe Narcisse is a rich, unique fragrance that is not shy. Some have compared her to Elizabeth Taylor's diamonds and rubies. I think diamonds and rubies is a bit more reserved.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Several previous reviewers have used the adjective ""narcotic"" to describe Chloe Narcisse and I must agree. It smells exactly like I remember but better. This is a thick, unabashedly rich floral with some fruit and spice creating moving waves of scent. This could be a Sophia Grojsman (sp) fragrance. Beautiful. I do not see this being dated, but if one wishes to keep with the ""barely there"" trend of modern perfumery, a light spray in the air and walk through is in order. I say nuts to that LOL I want to drench myself in this.

For those of us who remember the 90s version, this does not smell reformulated in the least. This is one of those unrecognized classics in modern perfume and an amazing price, to boot! A warm, golden, glorious fragrance. Highly recommended for everyone of all ages.

Still smells exactly like the narcissus edging the raised beds in my garden during the opening. Utterly divine.",03/22/17 10:27,Nuitdenoel
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"CLOVES! And peaches. Cloves and peaches. The dry down is super intense floral and cloves.

If you like Elizabeth Taylors Diamonds and Rubies you might appreciate this. It smells like it could be a Grojsman creation with all that heavy duty peach.

Warning: DO NOT BLIND BUY (unless you seriously dig cloves and peaches).

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I just received a bottle of Chloe Narcisse EDT. The juice is very strong, like a Perfume Oil, I think it may be a vintage bottle or a first run bottle because they don't make 'em like this anymore. This is a unique and beautiful scent. It is so hard to describe but I will try; sarsaparilla root mixed with honey and a drop of vanilla. Hints florals somewhat similar to honeysuckle. Something definitely sugary sweet, but in a mature way, maybe too sweet for some people. A hint of powder and licorice. I know it probably sounds bizarre but its a beautiful blend. I think there is a flower named Narcisse, but I have never seen or smelled it. I highly recommend this Narcisse for a mature minded woman who enjoys candy sweet floral blends. It is not a personal favorite of mine, but I do like it a lot, and I will wear it when the mood strikes.

In order for my reviews to remain authentic and unbiased, I always review scents prior to reading about the fragrance, prior to reading reviews, and prior to reading the accords. I also try to avoid focusing on the name, bottle, and ad campaign.",01/30/17 13:19,CycoEva
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I was under the impression that I'd reviewed Chloe Narcisse in the not-so-distant past. But no. Perhaps because she's ultimately a tad hard to describe? So I'll give my little synopsis, in hopes of helping someone else.

Chloe Narcisse is not a bit like any other Chloe, the original Chloe included. That one begins with a hairspray/sharp soap vibe and dries down to floral-musk BLISS. It's perfectly blended and distinctly old fashioned. Worth trying if you adore anything pre-1980 floral.

Narcisse, on the other hand, is all about NARCISSUS flowers! If you don't care for them, then don't bother with this particular Chloe, plain and simple. There is plentiful musk and - of course - other flowers and fruit as well. Not edible fruits, yet their honeyed essence adds an animalic punch to the flowers that could easily horrify those unfamiliar with heady florientals and older scents in general. Though this is the kind of heavy artillery the 80's excelled at, to me Narcisse stands alone.

Something that most people mention is fabulous (or appallingly loud, take your pick!) sillage. DEFINITELY. Other than Arabian attars, I can't think of a single fragrance that has more power. My initial bottle was a vintage parfum mini, considerably more potent than my current edt. Too much,too medicinal,too 'pow', said my wee nose, and I sent it away to a friend. The edt is still intensely strong, but less concentrated. One spray is the total amount required to last for hours... and hours. Suitable for people who are not afraid of heavy scent and favor heady classics. Perhaps not elegant, but potentially seductive in miniscule amounts.

Something I AM a little surprised by? How few people mention smelling cloves! Thanks to a Narcissus and Carnation heavy balance, it's easy to conjure up the smell of a cloves - on steroids. Backed by an overwhelming garden of Narcissus and old fashioned Musk? Perhaps not the easiest scent to love, but addictive once the taste has been acquired. ;)

In short, not a safe blind buy, not for the perfume sensitive, and not boring! A gorgeous, distinctive bargain.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"This is a lovely floral perfume, strong and long lasting and quite a sillage, enough for a male co-worker to say, smells delicious, when in the lunch room full of curry and all sorts of different food smell we had brought in to heat in the microwave,
Its a very feminine perfume. I like it.
You dont need much, a spritz is quite enough to begin with!",01/13/17 14:57,JacquieDS
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I blind bought this, based not only on the reviews, but also on the fact that i usually appreciate a lot all fragrances that come from Chloe house, but i was disapointed.

I think i never saw so many positive and passionate reviews about a perfume like this one, which is really curious to me, since i found this to be too intoxicating and strong. And i only spritzed it once on the back of my hand.

At first sniff it reminded me of something in the past, something from the nineties, when i was a child. Of course i did not know Narcisse by then, but probably there might have been something else at that time that had the same notes, maybe even trying to copy the original fragrance, i don't know...

I was walking on the street right after that, under a hot, melting sun, and maybe this fact must have caused a bad effect on the development of the fragrance...

I could detect some beautiful notes, but also a very annoying and intoxicating one, that i did not like at all. After a while it turned out to be a very peachy scent on my skin, that also reminded me of traditional Burberry.

It's veeery strong, so be careful ! This is a positive thing tough, since many fragrances nowadays seems to be sugary water that fades within less than an hour.

Very classy, very distinctive, extremely strong and huge projection. A classic representative of the nineties. If you are looking for something different , you might try this one.",01/02/17 08:21,amelieblue
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,Chloe Narcisse is absolutely beautiful.,12/06/16 14:49,Moonlight Spellbound
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Chloe Narcisse is for me, and always was for me, a fragrance for summer. Make no mistake. This is a woman's perfume. Nothing unisex, or even slightly masculine about it. Every note & every smell in this fragrant formula is tailor made for the woman who is mature, but sweet, married, comfortable, elegant, confident but not arrogant. This is a fragrance I used to smell on a lot of the female teachers of the school where I served as vice principal (later I moved up to principal). The faculty lounge was always redolent with Chloe Narcisse! This beauty was very popular in the early 90's, roughly between 1993 and 1995. But it was always in the summer time (summer school) or spring time, under cooler weather. A breeze can really bring out this scent from your skin wafting into the air and scenting it with apricot, flowers & spice. There's so much to love about this aroma. It still makes me swoon. I'm glad they didn't mess with the formula!

Top notes are peach, apricot & pineapple. That pineapple gets a nondescript faint smell and there's more apricot or nectar in it. A ripe peach is there as well. This is a dark fruit scent, very dense & concentrated, spicy, and later, balsamic. The fruit notes are reminiscent of Femme by Rochas. It's an exotic ""Hinduism"" scent. I've been to Sri Lanka and this takes me back there. Chloe Narcisse is an Oriental, but it's not a typical one. It's far more fruity than a floral Oriental, and less smoky & not unisex in the vein of most Oriental scents; nor does it smell of Arabian oud. This is a sweet summer time scent of nectar of the gods. It smells of island girls picking fruit & flowers to offer to Krishna; who appears to them himself playing the flute. Radha, Krishna's lover, a former shepherdess who became immortal, was among these girls, and now her fragrance has become a divine balsamic oil to scent her followers.

A narcissus scent is detectable, but even though reviewers on Fragrantica have it as the dominant note, for me it's the marigold & carnation. The yellow floral marigold or tagete is quite heavy. The cloying sweetness that follows the dark fruit owes to the multiple flowers in this bouquet including orange blossom (also detectable), violet, gardenia, jasmine and rose. A note of rose oil is included and it's exactly the way rose oil (Persian/Middle Eastern rose oil) smells like. Under it is a muskiness and tolu balsam, sandalwood & rich vanilla. It's one of those rare breed of perfumes that marry the East & West: Eastern rose oil, balsam, spices, sandalwood & Western florals (European flowers like narcissus & rose) along with fruit like pineapple & apricot.

Chloe Narcisse is ""day wear"" perfume. It matches up with a very pretty floral print dress; perhaps more of those 90's flower print dresses that are no longer in vogue, or (don't laugh)1960's 1970's muumuu like the ones my mother wore! It's like a Hawaiian aloha shirt or skirt/sarong. It always brings me to an island as I said before reminds me of Sri Lanka; but it might as well be the Polynesian islands or Easter Island. In the day time this stuff smells good when applied with a light touch, not powdery but very sweet in it's fruity floral spiciness. It's definitely for the more mature crowd who have better taste in perfume. When dry this perfume is a delicious creamy vanilla. A popular & very beloved perfume as all the rave reviews attest.

Warning: As it is super sweet & dense, please spray at your own peril! I have sprayed this stuff liberally but no one likes how it smells when there's too much of it on. I now only spray a lot of it on in the hot summer months in South Carolina when I'm alone in my property in Mount Pleasant. It's one of my many summer fragrances I keep wearing, like a piece of clothing you just can't get tired of.

It is the most interesting perfume I've ever smelt. It changes all day. One minute it's florally, then it's fruity, then musky, then spicy, then woody, then citrusy.......... really amazing.

I completely love it. I sprayed it on (quite a lot, on my body and clothes) early in the morning, 4.15am, and it was still strong when I was in bed at 10pm!!!!! I loved lying there, revelling in this gorgeous smell till I went to sleep; and I even could still smell it when I got up this morning!! Oh my god. It's amazing! It is strong and intense, but not too strong. This morning I've sprayed less on than yesterday, and it's virtually the same strength, so I know I don't have to put as much on, to get the intensity I love so much.. Yesterday, at the beginning, I thought it might not be strong enough (I LOVE strong perfumes), so I'd put a bit extra on, but thank God, I now know, I don't have to use up my bottle as quickly!!

It's such a gorgeous perfume! I am completely in love with it. It's divine!",11/05/16 13:43,Love Black Black Love
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Chloe Narcisse Chloe is my beloved perfume in my collection of perfumes. I would describe it like an elixir. It is very warm, spicy, sweet and gourmand smell. You can ""eat perfume"" with your each single breath. When you wear it, you want to close your eyes and breathe it whole day a long, and may be you want to be left alone with that perfume one to one. It is enjoyment walking along the streets, enjoying yourself and breath it from your body, feel yourself confident, happy and beautiful. It is very long lasting perfume with moderate or heavy silage.
On my opinion, it is perfume not for seduce men or to make an afford to seduce men. It is perfume for you, for make you happy, for make your ""me time"" . Be independent, enjoy yourself, be yourself and be happy.

If you are choosing between Chloe and Chloe Narcisse , I would be going for Chloe Narcisse . It is a really masterpiece from Chloe . After I had bought Chloe Narciss , I bought Chloe as well, and I had expected Chloe would be similar to that , but I have been disappointed . Chloe is the very good perfume too but not the same kind of like Chloe Narcisse.",10/27/16 13:35,mayyay90
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I think Chloe Narcisse does not get the credit it deserves. It maybe gets too easily written off as a 90's scent when it is so much more complicated than that. I got my first bottle of Narcisse back in the grunge-era. I was very young and I remember that it gave me a headache. I was drawn by the sexy ads, but I think I was far too young to use it then. Now I understand that it was a scent that emulated a femininity that I knew I had in me, but had not yet found as a young teenage girl. I don't recall if I ended up using it and I don't know what happened to the bottle. I recently came across a bottle and I had this strong feeling that I had to get it. Even though I remembered that I had not used it that much. Glad I did. The heady top notes still kind of give me that ooooff-heady feeling, but my goodness the middle and base of this scent is sooo gorgeous. Its very difficult to explain what it actually is, its at the same time heavy-ish but still sweet, fresh, floral. The only word I can find to explain it is ""yummy"" and I keep smelling my wrists. Im glad I found this scent again. Its sexy, curvy, and feminine. I love how complicated it is, and I love my history with this scent. From girl to woman.",10/22/16 11:57,susieblue

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Chloe Narcisse is very much alike to a Brazilian perfume called Cecita by Boticário (currently off Boticário's line-up), which was quite long lasting (about 6 hours) and with good sillage.I had always assumed that Cecita was a copy of Narcisse, but now I realize it is the other way around, since Cecita was launched in 1982, a full 10 years prior Narcisse. Lots of common notes, same sillage though with upper moderate longevity.",10/19/16 09:47,socorrosouza
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Chloe Narcisse is one of the most beautiful Oriental floral fragrances I wore in the 1990s.

This perfume, in fact, always takes me back to 1992 and 1993. In London, the grunge music scene which began in the West Coast of the US was beginning to arrive and the colors were bolder, and the skirts shorter. I was too late to wear the fashions of the young ladies I taught music to but I always wore their perfumes.

By the early 90's, I was teaching music and voice (opera) and single for a number of years before I married for a final time. This scent was so attractive to me. I smelled it on my female students and began to envy their perfume.

The first time I wore it I was smart enough to wear it outside of class and only allowed friends my age in soirees and formal functions and charity events, fundraisers and Church to smell this on me. My God I used to douse myself in this scent. My entire bedroom smelled of this scent, and it was like a sauna mist.

Narcisse opens with a deep profusion of fruit concentrate. It doesn't start fresh at all. This is a fragrance that identifies herself as Oriental from the first spritz. This is a deep rich mature apricot, plum, pineapple and peach scent. These are boozy notes, like fruit cocktails or fruit wine. The apricot is the dominant accord, perhaps even the master note out of all the other notes. If you are fond of apricot, try this on for size.

A lot of the fruit notes remind me of Femme By Rochas. This is almost like a modern Femme, with the exact same dark fruit. It's delicious and intoxicating, exotic. In fact this opening had to be the way it is in order for me to like it.

In the 90's, the opening notes were very integral to the success of a fragrance. Most of the 90's fruity florals were big on fruit with predominantly peach-apricot-pineapple scents. Sophia Grojsman made use of this trend to get her the acclaim for such well formulated fragrances as Tresor by Lancôme and Karl Lagerfeld Sun Moon Stars. This is not like either of them.

It's set apart as a rich plummy juicy fruit booze. It's a Polynesian beach. It's a Gauguin painting. The colors are blood red, deep orange, and white. This smells like a perfumed sarong.

The floral notes are there but they are only standing behind the fruit notes like chorus dancers in a Broadway ensemble. The narcissus, which is the moniker of this fragrance, is so light and so silky that it seems to drop to the floor like petals of narcissus flowers being plucked and scattered to the air.

There is bigger doses of rose and violet floral notes. Rose oil is one of the notes and it's hitting the nail on the head. Definitely rose scented oil. In fact it shocked me as how natural it smelled. There is no way any of these notes are artificial or chemically enhanced, because they really do give off a more graphic, oily, deep and natural effect.

This is as much a deep red rose as it is a white floral. The other white floral notes include jasmine and gardenia. To me this was still not as heavy or as fragrant a white floral as I'd experienced in other perfumes. The red rose is the Queen. The deep redness of velvet textured roses and rose oil also seem to match up with the color of the scent which is like a tomato juice red, very similar to Femme Rochas' color.

The notes in the base play tricks on you.

I smelled honey and vanilla.

This is a unique and amazing creamy dry down.

Never before I had experienced a fragrance that smelled like buttery cream instead of musk or woods as it dries down and fades away. It's a vanilla cream, but it also has incense.

The incense is coming out of nowhere and darkening the tone of the scent. I wondered if it was oak moss but it seems to be a note of incense, with a smokiness, but a steady and slow stream of smoke, and also, like the other notes, not as heavy or overpowering as you think it would be.

There is also a balsam which I suppose smells similar to honey. That balsam and oiliness is the true nature of the base. No woods or patchouli. Just balsam.

Naracisse not a light, airy, fresh, and brightly lit perfume. She is dark, but yet not mysterious.

She is an exotic dark haired young woman that you see coming and going to and fro from an unknown location in the jungle and to the beach where she seems to mingle with the tourists. She is a monkey like creature with brown eyes and long, savage black hair. She's also rather sad and keeps to herself. But beautiful.

The perfume also reminds me of the song Bali Hai from South Pacific. It has that same kind of longing for an escape into a paradise of fruits and flowers, of warm sun and beaches, and no worries or toil.

Bali Hai will whisper, on a wind of the sea, here am I your special island, come to me, come to me....

I am so in love with this fragrance. She is sexy, sultry, spicy, honeyed, balsamic, sweet, delicious, boozy, exotic, and a perfume that can transform even the homeliest frumpiest woman into a sex goddess.

Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"While having my hair trimmed recently, I noticed the most gorgeous fragrance dancing in the air. Initially, I assumed that it must be one of the botanical salon products that my stylist was using...until a young woman walked by leaving a lingering perfume trail. Fortunately, this woman was generous enough to share the name of the mystery floral in question: Chloe Narcisse. Needless to say, I immediately ordered a bottle of Narcisse later that day.

Like another reviewer mentioned, Chloe Narcisse is reminiscent of Estee Lauder's Beautiful. Both perfumes share many of the same notes: ripe peach, carnation, rose, and orange flower. However, Narcisse is exceptionally sensual and and alluring. It has a narcotic effect. Narcisse is truly one of the best in its category. Sillage (radiates 4 feet) and longevity (7+ hours) are unparalleled! This juice is a real show stopper! Prepare to be showered with compliments while wearing this intensely feminine classic.",09/25/16 18:10,SCBohemian
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Chloe Narcisse is a romantic sophisticated floral fragrance with a woodsy finish. It's elegant and mature but can be worn by younger crowds who are getting into florals. This is a sweet but not sickly-sweet floral perfume with a narcissus in the background, not the front. It's still a narcissus because that's how it ends up but it's elaborately floral with roses, jasmine, violets, orange blossom, marigold, and carnation. Carnations and roses smell alike so this is as much a carnation as it is a rose. Beautiful flower bomb. It reminds me of 2 Estee Lauders: Beautiful and Spellbound and 1 Elizabeth Arden: Red Door. Like those fragrances, it's a romantic and soft powdery floral perfume. There's a rich vanilla in the base that really smells good and it's creamy and deep. There's also some musk and woods. It's so beautiful. I wear this for myself to feel beautiful and to match up with some of my cocktail dresses and gowns. It's as womanly as it possibly can be with less aggression than Yves Saint Laurent Paris. It's wearable as an every day scent in the spring and summer months. Lots of love for this scent.",09/23/16 06:07,Southern Blonde
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,Just purchased this. Smelled wonderful as I sampled. I just want to keep it but I do know just a little spray is enough compared to how I need to over spray with so many recent scents. Definitely from another time period but fun to wear for a change from the fruity ones I've grown to love presently. I resent the term old women perfumes since I am older yet understand why that is said. I have experienced Beautiful on the wrong person and it can be way too overpowering and reek. This one I feel I need to be careful with or possibly layer with something new. Experimenting will be interesting since I have hundreds of scents and love trying to come up with something different. Maybe I'll wear it in my alone time. And must try and see if the husband likes it. He's too honest. I just know after many hours it can smell wonderful and better. I do love a scent that lasts and stays true to it's name and doesn't turn all powdery at the base. I have found so many smell exactly the same during the last layer. I would say this reminds me of a very elegant lady spritzing this on as she goes out for a wonderful evening. Such as in the song lady in red. And with the hopes of being asked what she is wearing that smells so good. I do hope some of these scents make a comeback and I think they will when the trend changes.

If Narcisse was a woman, she would be a voluptious temptress with round hips, big soft breasts and a deep cleavage. (I don't have any of that for the record). She has long brown-red hair with shiny Hollywood-style waves that move up and down in slow motion(just like her breasts haha)when she walks down the boulevard.

The scent doesn't say ""sorry"", its all out there, big and proud, and (suffocatingly) sweet. A fellow fragrantitian below here somewhere said that the fruits in Narcisse are beyond ripe, and yes they really are. So be gentle applying it, and enjoy the metamorphosis the perfume makes on you.

It is definitely a big Love for me. Cause it sure gives me those round hips that move from side to side when I'm wearing it :)",09/01/16 04:22,Katrin77
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I tested and bought this today at Kohl's and it's a gorgeous scent. Right off the bat, I get a mix of creamy white and yellow florals: sweet Frangipani, Ylang-ylang, Tuberose, and Narcissus (of course!). Narcissus by itself can be very cloying. My parents have plants that come up in the Springtime and it's overpowering to my nose so I'm very happy that this is blended so beautifully.

Although different, this scent is up there with Bijan Woman and Hanae Mori, very warm spicier scents. I'm excited to spray this as soon as the weather cools down.",08/05/16 15:18,Suzybee

Base Notes

Cedar Wood Sandalwood Vanilla Balsam Musk

This is a beautiful spring floral fragrance. As a die-hard fan of the original Chloe perfume, which got me through so many early adulthood years, this flanker fascinated me. For years I avoided it because I always smelled it on my co-workers. This was a scent that all the perfume sales girls I worked with wore the heck out of. I was never one to follow the crowds. That's the same reason I avoided wearing Alien by Mugler for years. Finally after having nothing to do with girls who wore this perfume, I got around to wearing it myself. This is a delicious fruity floral straight from the 90's when this type of fragrance was in vogue. I.E. think Tresor by Lancome Casmir by Chopard Donna by Pavarotti and Estee Lauder Tuscany. This is a summer time fruit flavored fragrance with sweet peaches, rich apricot juice along with citrus and pineapple. The pineapple is my favorite fruit scent in perfume. I always jump for joy when I discover it as a note. So the top is all the fruit you could ever love. It reminds me just a little bit of Femme by Rochas but that's the fragrance one inevitably compares all other fruit frags to.

After the fruit cornucopia scent wears off, your nose is ravished by the main flower in this bouquet: narcissus. This is a beautiful homage to the narcissus flower. In addition, there are other white flower scents of jasmine, gardenia and carnation. There is a rose note but even the rose is a white rose smell. Such a rich composition of florals. It can be a bit too much and the association with mature ladies and flowers are there but so what. If you like flowers go for it. This is absolutely beautiful in it's floral heart. This can easily be worn by brides on their wedding days. There's plenty of white flowers in it and smells like a bridal bouquet. Sometimes it even has the vibe of Amarige. This is a summer wedding scent. If you have to get married in a traditional white wedding gown wear this perfume on a beautiful summer day.

The dry down is woodsy with extract of cedar and some sandalwood. But I never at any time found it to be too woodsy nor a chypre, as one would believe. It's nothing like the woods found in Femme Rochas. This is all about those fruits at the top and the flowers in the heart. They are well balanced and the only strong enough base note holding them up is the vanilla and the musk. It's more vanilla than musk but they are both doing a fine job of keeping the perfume together. The vanilla is to die for the musk is mingling with warm spices and myrrhs, and balsamic oils. Gorgeous absolutely gorgeous.

There is nothing I don't like about this perfume. It is easy to wear if you spritz lightly, it has excellent silage and longevity. Once in a while I spray liberally up and down my leg with it like Melanie Griffith did in the wedding party crash scene in Working Girl. It has a fantastic silage. People smell it on me after I leave a room or walk past them. This leads me to believe it's totally a wedding perfume. This frag is also worn by mother and sister. I make sure I am not going to wear it at the same time they do. I like to stand out wearing this scent although I recommend it to anyone who loves vintage florals.",08/03/16 19:40,Gigi The Fashionista
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"This was my aunt's signature scent and I ordered it for nostalgic reasons since my aunt raised me and all my childhood memories are bonded to her
I really didn't think this is going to be wearable for me,my mistake,it's really pretty and likable
This is definitely nineties style,an era between kingdom of aldehydic,animalic chypres and modern cotton candys,this belongs to decade of sweet fruity perfumes(yvress,casmir,deci dela)with a yellowish,golden vibe
It opens with sweet,sharp,juicy apricot and peach,then spices and Narcisse and other florals kick in and turn it to a less juicy,bittersweet powdery,spicy floralfruity..dry down is warmer,rounder and not bitter any more with vanilla and some balsamic elements,warm and delicious in a voluptious way
Narcisse is not a modern scent but wearable in modern days,it's not a bitter classic floral that lots of today's young females can't get along with..any sweet fruity scents lover my appreciate it,in any age group(like nina ricci deci della).Narcisse and carnation are not much used in modern perfumery,so it can make a unique sweet fragrance
I really like it when a scent is warm,sweet and also has a fresh vibe..I also love to add my floral fruity more oomph by adding some spices or powdery notes so it's a keeper..and this Narcisus,syrupy honeyed apricot combo stays for ages on my skin,specially layered with it's body lotion..great for Springs and falls,it's happy and colorful scent,rich,delicious and well made
P.s:sharpness and bitterness of opening part may let down young audiences,it may be narcisus or spices that are responsible for this bitterish undertone,the bitter vibe is detectable even in body lotion,but it really fades and you are left with a sweet,powdery floral fruity,so give it time
❤❤❤❤
کلوهه نارسیس,مشخصا یه عطر دهه نودیه.دوره ای مابین آلدهیدی ها و چیپره های انیمالیک و عطرهای شیرین و پشمکی مدرن...دهه نود عصر عطرهای شیرین و میوه ای گلی با تم طلایی(مثل شامپاین,دسی لا,کشمیر و...)و البته کاملا متفاوت با گلی میوه ای های صورتی وآبکی این روزا
من ک تصور یه عطر قدیمی و غیرقابل استفاده تو عصر مدرن رو داشتم,اما کاملا در اشتباه بودم,نارسیس بسیار شاد و دلنشین و برای دوستداران عطرهای شیرین گلی,میوه ای در تمام گروه های سنی قابل استفاده ست
شروع عطر با رایحه ای شیرین و میوه ای و آبدار زردآلو و هلو همراهه اما خیلی زود,نرگس و سایر نت های گلی و اسپایسی از شیرینی آبدار عطر کم میکنن و تلخی خاصی به عطر میدن و روایح پودری,اسپایسی و گلی به میوه های عطر اضافه میکنن..درای داون,باحضور وانیل و روغن های بالزامی,شیرینتر گرمتر و بدون زاویه ست و دیگه خبری از اون تلخی نیست..این عطر خوشمزه شاد شیرین و غنیه
تلخی ک در اوایل عمر نارسیس شاهدش هستیم و احتمالا ادویه جات یا گل نرگس مسئولش هستن احتمالا خیلی از مصرف کننده های کم سن رو پس بزنه,این تلخی حتی تو لوسیون بدنش هم حضور داره اما حتما بهش فرصت بدید چون این تلخی کاملا از بین میره
اگه دنبال یه فلورال فروتی بسبار متفاوت هستید ک با گلی میوه ای های امروزه متفاوت باشه کلوهه نارسیس گزینه عالی عست.چون گل نرگس و میخک امروزه کمتر تو عطرها استفاده میشه و کم پیش میاد چاشنی ادویه جات و پودر و کمی فاکتورهای بالزامی همراهشون داشته باشن..درضمن موندگاری و پخش این عطر عالیه مخصوصا وقتی همزمان با لوسیونش استفاده شه ترکیب گل نرگس و زردآلوی عسلی ساعتها رو پوست میمونه",07/28/16 12:02,Soofiya
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I picked up my bottle today! At first it is strong and sharp with a hint of bitterness. Later on it surprises me by resembling Estee Lauder's Beautiful. Beautiful, but without the overly sweetness found in Beautiful. I rather like this better because the bitterness adds a touch of mystery. It is indeed very strong and I for one will have to spray with a very light hand. I usually do go overboard with sprays. This scent you either love its unique notes or you hate. Well at least now I know what the narcisse flower smells like as I am no garden green fingers! It would be interesting to hear from any other member who thinks this resembles EL's Beautiful.
Edit: I made an error with the 'EL Beautiful' likeness. In fact it smells like EL Spellbound without the mint! And then, as the base notes appear, it seems to become sweeter and resemble Beautiful. Now why I find the Spellbound likeness fascinating is because I had always liked Spellbound but found the minty bit made it seem like a high class toothpaste! So in this Narcisse, here we have Spellbound without the heady mint and it makes this edp more bearable to me.",06/20/16 08:24,d'odora
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,I love this - beautiful lasting floral which is so pretty. Picked up the 100ml Edp for under $30AUD at my local chemist using my discount card. I tried it on a tester card before purchasing & the girl in the store wasn't a fan lol. I remember the magazine ads from the 90's could never afford it back then so initially I was worried about the cheap price might mean a cheap nasty product. Once home I tried it on my skin - initial strong tang dries down into a lovely floral which last for hours which smells just how I remember the original. Def does not smell cheap - very complex floral which I prefer to the mainstream sweeter ones on the market now. Love the gardenia and def get the woody base as it settles- gorgeous.,06/11/16 17:28,Artygirl
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Bought this because I've loved the original for ages, I won't bore anyone with analyzing the floral notes and composition, but I will say that the first thing that comes to mind when I first inhale CN is banana flavored laughy taffy candy. Love this.",06/08/16 02:15,Lucius Smellfoy
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,Narcisse... what can I say that hasn't already been said? A deliciously thick warm floral that lasts the whole day with a single spray. It's like they found a way to bottle a beautiful-yet-sticky summer day and I absolutely love it. Very iconic indeed.,06/02/16 22:44,anastasiajohanssen
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"I have the vintage parfum. This goes on an odd floral (daffodil with maybe a hint of marigold. It is very soft and close to the skin not a big scent. Then it dries down with fruit notes in the middle to a VERY candy sweet, almost gourmand.And there it sits and fades two hours later. I like it but it's not amazing to me.",05/04/16 04:47,gtabasso
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"One of my favorites of all time. It has a snappy, vegetal freshness that is otherworldy and beautiful. I think that its closest companion is Byredo's La Tulipe, which has the greenest, stemmiest, waxy quality. In juxtaposition, Narcisse evokes the moist petals of daffodils, and the peppery crispness of carnation along with the snap of stems. Within minutes, the peach and apricot begin to infuse the flowers with a fleshy sour note. It's not a ripe peach exactly, more like the firm, golden fruit before it has come to fruition.

It's freshness is reminiscent in some ways of Estee Lauder's White Linen, in that Narcisse evokes a clean, wind-scrubbed outdoorsiness, a no nonsense, cleanliness that retains sunshine in the bottle. Remarkable!

I believe that the official description above that suggests that one ""be careful how much you use,"" does Narcisse a disservice. The same could be said of any fragrance, and such a directive might scare off potential sniffers. Don't be alarmed fellow Fragranticans! Narcisse is well worth discovering.",05/03/16 09:08,diedofennui
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"Men-love-this. It's distinctively feminine, floral and sweet. As it's suggested by the name, it does smell like Narcissus (flower itself and the oil) which is known to induce a state of delirium in higher doses. It also causes addiction... I challenge you to try this for yourself in a megadose for a few consequent days. I found myself burning with desire...

Just in case, try to get an older badge (2012 or earlier) to ensure we are on the same page. Mine's for a matter of public service is 2290.",03/18/16 00:36,mystica
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"This is a heavenly bouquet of freshly-cut daffodils and carnations, stems and all, doused in apricot syrup and sprinkled with soft spices. A detectable marigold note also adds a bitter nuance to the fragrance which prevents Narcisse from being intoxicatingly sweet.

This fragrance is heady and captivating and has the most amazing warmth to it. Narcisse truly never fails to bring a huge smile to my face every time I wear it because this is liquified euphoria. A masterpiece!",02/26/16 05:24,Azula
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"After all the years, I still love this perfume in the summertime. I loved it when I was younger and wore it all the time. And then, I took a break from it for over a decade. Now I am revisiting this fragrance and one little spray goes a long way. It's a beautiful floral perfume meant to be used moderately. It would be better in a little dropper bottle instead of spray to place in little pulse points.",02/02/16 06:52,avamarie
Chloé Narcisse Chloé,"When I was younger, a friend wore this. I don't know if she used to wear way too much or if it has changed so much or if my sense of smell has just dulled a bit, but I used to be knocked physically sick by it. It was my nemesis scent (a place now occupied by EA Sunflowers). 20 years later I smelled a familiar scent. I practically drifted round the room like Pepe le Pew, following the scent trying to.figure out where it was coming from. Eventually I narrowed it down and asked the lovely lady in question. I was guessing for Deci Dela by Nina Ricci (not having smelled that in years) only to find out it was Narcisse. I was so shocked.
Needless to say I figured buying a bottle would make sense in case it disappeared.
I have a horrendous cold today and wasn't able to smell much when it appeared today but I could smell this. I will update when I can review properly but I will say one spray is enough. And that's practically noseblind! It is sweet, incredibly so and strongly vanilla after a couple of hours. My bf also has a cold but after I put it on, he walked into the room...and Slapped. My. Ass.
Seriously.
I don't know what they put in this stuff.",01/23/16 17:38,cinnakitty

See by Chloé Eau Fraiche Chloé,So disappointed with this :( I was hoping for sweet apple blossom like the original (which seems to be impossible to find now) and instead I got linear pen ink.,05/16/20 16:18,dotdotdot90
See by Chloé Eau Fraiche Chloé,"Wow, I should've paid more attention to the reviews that said that this was a soapy scent. This is a persistent laundry detergent type of smell almost straight out of the gate. I've only had the opportunity to smell the original See by Chloe via a stingy spritz from a sales associate at an outlet mall shop. Considering the soft apple scent I got at the outset, I can't say that this Eau Fraîche smells like the original at all.

This flanker begins with vetiver quickly followed by water hyacinth. If you read music, you'll understand that the vetiver alone is like a grace note that's played right before the note that signifies the water hyacinth-vetiver melange. This melange is the entire song— there's no dynamism here. At the end, I feel the water hyacinth comes to the foreground and maybe the whisper of an exhausted jasmine is accompaniment. This is a soft, pale green clean-ish floral accord ending things. I don't get apple blossom (or ink) at any time.

I was hoping this less expensive and more readily available flanker would be a shortcut to that beguiling birdcage bottle, but it looks like I'm going to have to get it the hard way.",03/22/19 18:33,OolongLaLa
See by Chloé Eau Fraiche Chloé,"As I am still learning what scents I really like on me, I can say if it has Vetiver, no thanks! That is all I can smell of this.

So congrats on longevity because after 12 hours and many scrubs later, I could still smell it. At least I have learned that I really do not like heavy notes of Vetiver base notes in perfumes and will pay close attention to future selections. I couldn't smell any other notes and I don't really get the ink pen scent some are talking about.",05/17/18 08:26,DebiL1211

I´m just gonna save the rest that´s in my bottle and sniff it once in a while to remember the year 2015 when I used it.

See by Chloé Eau Fraiche Chloé,"A pretty, simple, and modernistic daily feminine perfume for day-use, stuck in the midway between girly and womanly. It's categorized as Eau Fariche, but I cannot call it fresh--according to my own perception, and it's not low in concentration. However, the sweetness of this one is perfectly balanced with sour notes.

Although it lacks the complications many perfume-holics seek, the smell remains unique, pleasant, truly within the Parisian lines, naturally complimented, and with impressive projection. It cannot rise to the level of an innovation no matter, but still its distinctive to what is being usually released. I find it quite memorable.

I understand the pen-ink similarity, but that's part of the apple blossoms' smell mixed with vetiver. Somehow true on paper, with some exaggeration, but I personally perceive that in a good way on the skin.

My bottle doesn't give a soapy smell (except during the final dry-down phase after 8 hours), but rather it gives a very light creamy make-up vibe.

If you need something overstated or head-turning, then this is NOT your perfect choice. This is an ideal choice for casual looks, during the day, yet it smells nice, expensive, and memorable.

It was just soap. A high-end soap, to be sure, but soap none the less. I've seen others describe it as an expensive creamy soap bar, and I think that is the perfect description for this fragrance.

It's light and fresh, but generic. It would be an appropriate daytime scent to wear to work. The longevity is good. I got about six hours worth of silage before it became a skin scent, and 10 hours later I could still smell it when I put my nose to my wrist.",03/12/14 20:14,Wynter

See by Chloé Eau Fraiche Chloé,"I wasn't a huge fan of the original since I thought it was a bit too harsh. So I was looking forward to this edition of eau fraiche.

The opening is beautiful as to be expected. A tinge of the original can be found throughout the heart. The jasmine which is so overpowering in the original is tame and more balanced in this edition.

All in all the scent is pleasant. Kinda soapy and reminds me strongly of Cacharel's anais anais. I thoroughly enjoyed this testing but I won't be purchasing a bottle, this scent is too timid for my taste.

Sillage is moderate. Lasting time: still very noticable after 5 hours. I recommend daywear and the age bracket is teenage to about thirty.",02/22/14 10:15,Roslaug

The Water Hyacinth is noticeable, making it more floral and bright, feminine too. Lasting power despite being an edt, is quite good, same as edp.

Hibiscus Abelmoschus Chloé,"I was looking for a soft lavender scent, which is why I went to Chloe because there's an option for a single scent. While at the store, I also tried Hibiscus and fell in love with how light, airy, and cool the scent is. It is so fresh. When I mixed it with Chloe Lavanda, I got the same scent as the moonflower body mist by Bodyshop that discontinued long ago, around 19 years ago. Since there's a promotion of buy one 150ml size and get a free 50ml size, I decided to buy the Hibiscus in a 150ml bottle and the free Lavanda in a 50ml bottle.

I already have Chloe Tuberose and papyrus at home, and I will try mixing them with these scents to see if there are any surprises.

Edit: I use it too much and kept re-apply it, I think 150ml won't be enough for me. Will purchase it again, but only when they have another buy 1 get 1 promo again. This is a soft, airy, floral scent that I really love but I have to admit, the price are bit too high.

Also, I really like to use it in a humid weather, because whenever I get sweat, the scent become stronger on me",04/06/24 21:13,Mimachan

Soon (as another reviewer pointed out), I get the Mugler Cologne type synthetic (""S""/steam), and that of course generates a bit of a musky quality. I only used one spray to the chest and it seems light, but I get wafts of it now and then. This might be the kind of scent that is better under warm conditions, so that is worth looking into.

Eau de Fleurs Capucine Chloé,"I've been wearing this scent for about a week now. First this is a superb green scent!! There' aren't many reviews for Capucine so I'll try to write up a summary of what everyone said and touch up with my personal experience.

The Capucine experience is definitely about showcasing the raw qualities of galbanum, a type of grass resin. The scent opens with loud, prickly galbanum that evokes smell of fresh cut grass and crushed vegetation. The clary sage and juniper berries added vegetal spiciness to the galbanum, rounding and smoothing out the bitterness that would otherwise be overwhelming. During the several days of wear I have not noticed any citrus notes, so either they are very well blended with the other top notes (making it a ""tea note"" like other reviewers described), or that they are weak.

The fresh, energizing blast of green vegetation goes on about 1 hour before it dies down to a skin scent. This is the time that the white florals supposed to appear, but they don't (or at least I haven't detected them). The scent becomes a little more soapy from the rose-musk combo of Chloe's, but it's not recognizable unless I deliberately search from it after looking at the note pyramid. The pleasant grassy-musky skin scent then stays linear and finally disappear after 7, 8 hours on me. By hour 5 I'd be able to safely layer other scents on it. The overall experience is an understated, unisex but very elegant presence. I think it's a perfect scent for spring and summer, and would work extremely well on rainy days.

So, Capucine is simple. Yet I cannot emphasize enough that despite the lack of complex concept and development, Capucine is far from being a ""boring"" scent. It belongs to very niche category of green scents which, instead of capturing the instant beauty of blooming flowers, attempts to deliver a full picture of the natural history of the plant. I find the smell almost like paying a humble tribute to the great outdoors. It is for this exact reason I adore this big olive bottle in my wardrobe.",04/04/15 14:34,pepperoniann
Eau de Fleurs Capucine Chloé,"I am surprised at how similar Capucine is to Peace, Love, and Juicy on me. They are not an exact match but are definitely in the same vein, perhaps because they both have Amalfi lemon at the top, jasmine in the middle, and musk at the base. While I like Capucine, I love Peace, Love, and Juicy possibly because it has a touch more floral and better longevity. It's also interesting that they have both been discontinued. (Good heavens, what does this say about my taste in fragrance?) I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that the bottle design feels very niche. I think it looks beautiful on my vanity.",11/26/14 11:53,roguelobster
Eau de Fleurs Capucine Chloé,"Wow! This is so different than scents I normally choose. I have a small coffret of this brilliant perfume trifecta & love to revisit them every Spring.
If you like Estée Lauder Private Collection or Mark Earth you will undoubtedly enjoy and appreciate this. It is grassy, pungent, soft, herbaceous, green, spicy & divine. You won't smell like anyone else around you wearing this. The dry down is the smell of your natural skin after spending a Spring day at the Park.

30 minutes - totaly disappeared (maybe i was immune to whatever note surfaced)
1 hour - a very gentle and very clean skin scent *swoon*. i'm starting to notice that the house of Chloe very expertly combines rose and musk to achieve this lovely scent
10 hours - intoxicating soft musk drydown, sits very close to the skin

would wear this exquisite fragrance on an intimate date ;-)",06/28/13 23:08,janelle70
Eau de Fleurs Capucine Chloé,"A wonderful and classy scent with herbal and green rea notes. Smells natural throughout all the stages of this perfume, which makes me doubt any comparisons with Sisley freen scents - they smelled downright artificial in the drydown.
My Capucine starts with bergamot, sage and yummy green tea. Then green tea steeps and becomes stronger, with a touch of juniper berries. Out the notes of the pyramid that's all I get - no flowers at all - nicht, nada. Oh, and the most pronounced note of green tea is not indicated somehow…
This a beautiful well-balanced green and herbal scent that somehow makes me think of Yoga. Capucin has the same tranquility and closeness to nature as I associate with Yoga.
I'm very relieved that Louise Turner had decided to create a green scent without the watery aquatic notes, that are falsely tied with freshness and greenness. So what we have is a very wearable naturalistic green scent that is perfect for daytime in spring and summer. I sprayed my wrist once at 3 pm, and at 10 pm I have faint grassy drydown, but a couple of hours ago the scent was still noticeable when I waived the hand gesturing.

This one is very easy to love and wear, it's undemanding, but has character. A keeper.",03/26/13 21:18,tourmali45
Eau de Fleurs Capucine Chloé,"Urban park in a bottle!!!

This scent is very fresh, light and smells better and better with time. It reminds me of urban parks for some reason.

Impressions:
Initial spritz - this smells like lime scented mosquito repellant
1 min - wow this smells like mosquito repellant mixed with freshly cut grass
5 min- still grassy and limey
20 min - good the harsh mosquito repellant note has begun to die down, the most prominent notes are green tea and lime
2 hrs later - this scent has really softened....it smells fresh, balmy, soft and feminine, and warm, the harsh green tea and lime tones have disappeared
11 hrs later - very soft, barely there, still fresh, slightly creamy and feminine
12 hrs later - what is left is creamy, soft and slightly floral...no musk on me yeah!!!

My skin type: oily / youthful
Projection: sits close to the skin
Potency: Light (5 or more sprays are necessary)
Longevity: 12 hrs
Office safe: Yes
Timing: spring & summer / anytime of the day

Eau de Fleurs Capucine Chloé,"I sampled this today and I found it very cold and metallic. It is not green in the manner in which I am used to (fresh, kind of zippy). I do not dislike it, but I do not like it enough to purchase it. Beautiful bottle - feels very niche.",11/28/12 20:44,mademoiselle-c
Eau de Fleurs Capucine Chloé,"What an odd creation Chloé EAU DE FLEURS CAPUCINE is! I was expecting something altogether different based on the reviews I had read. To my surprise, this perfume opens very similarly to EAU DE CARTIER. I am baffled, actually, as to how there could be no violet leaf listed among the notes!

Once I regained my balance from the blast of what I took to be violet leaf, I began slowly to notice other key components of this creation. First, neroli, then lily of the valley. After a few minutes and a real effort to identify what precisely it was that I was smelling, it dawned on me: the synthetic base of CAPUCINE smells very similar to Thierry Mugler MUGLER COLOGNE. It's got to be the laundry musk which ties them together, or peraps the synthetic ambroxan is helping, too. The proverbial ""green notes"" and neroli are probably not hurting the association either. Anyway, the last thing that I would call this composition is natural smelling, because the base is completely synthetic--and that is how it smells to me!

I do detect a fairly heavy dose of pepper (or reasonable facsimile) in this composition as well--also not listed among the notes. All in all, when all is said and sniffed, I must own that this is not a boring fragrance, although I cannot say that it is my favorite anything (floral green, LOTV, etc....). It certainly is the only perfume which reminds me as vividly in the opening of EAU DE CARTIER as it reminds me in the drydown of MUGLER COLOGNE. The color matches that of extra virgin olive oil.

In a word: weird.",11/15/12 16:12,sherapop

Eau de Fleurs Capucine Chloé,"I have to agree with Jae. This is indeed one of the nicer, more pleasurable green florals on the market today.

Eau de Fleurs Capucine is a green scent without the harsh watery and grassy accords. This fragrance opens simply with zesty bergamot and lemon, and an added hint of orange blossom, jasmine and lily of the valley. This fragrance is quite soft, hence the reason why it smells quite natural and pretty on the skin.

Towards the heart, this fragrance revels in revealing delicate and clean floral nuances, that are thankfully not too soapy nor too powdery. There's also a subtle touch of herbaceousness throughout this composition which gives this fragrance character.

It does have a slightly masculine feel, however that doesn't put me off the scent entirely. Eau de Fleurs Capucine reminds me of sunshowers and shy romances. It's pleasantly mellow and somewhat imaginative.

The sillage is intimate and very discreet. It brings me to conclude that this fragrance is very lady-like and reserved. I like it that way. I sometimes wonder why Chloe decided to make these fragrances limited editions which are relatively difficult to find. I much prefer the Eau de Fleurs series over and above the new Chloe and Chloe Love.",04/30/11 22:19,missk
Eau de Fleurs Capucine Chloé,"Wow... What a floral green this is!!! I LOVE it! The bonus is that this is totally unisex on my skin.

The longevity is amazing and the sillage is excellent. It's so fresh, floral and green all at once. Of all gender-benders, this is one of my favorites.

The verbena, citrus, peach and blackcurrant makes it just different enough from the OG. I was lucky to find an old stock and get a new bottle, but I am using it sparingly as I dread the day I will run out of it again, and I am considering getting one more just to stock it for later.

I just now randomly try it again. Omg! I have to change my mind! The citrus scent luckily is not loud at all, it goes pretty smoothly right in the beginning. Then right away comes the floral rose scent, which is so lovely and very relaxing.

Delicate, feminine. Reminds me of ballerina aesthetics a little bit. Reminds me of a brunch in a garden with flowers around. White chiffon dress and a hat. Summer day with a fresh wind. Very pristine.

I don’t like extreme citrus start. But after a few minutes it transforms into light floral scent with a generous drizzle of citrus skin.
Floral scent with delicate black currant, little bit of a peach on a musky base. Almost no citruses after time passes by.

After few hours it’s floral musky scent. Completely different sound comparing to first minutes and first hour.

Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"First of all, i don't know the original Chloe and usually i'm a gourmand lover and i don't really fall for aromatic-citrus and rose scents. But I got a decant from this as a gift, and for my biggest surprise i quite like it! The Verbena note is magical. It's fresh but on my skin it's more aromatic green verbena with a hint of citrus, and citrusy floral rose than just a plain fresh citrus scent. And the Rice note! That's really in the background but with the verbena it's really special. If u are bored by cologne like citrus scents, but likes the natural fresh line it's totally worth a try. It's office friendly but has some precious uniqueness in it. At first i want to give over it, but i'm going to keep it for this summer :D It can really brighten up a very natural but nice look and any white shirt- blue jeans combo (with a blaser too)",06/04/22 07:03,x.rina.x
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"I definitely had an ""I don't know what I expected"" moment when trying this. It smells just like Chloe EDP but with citrus.

Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"Such a beautiful and versatile perfume, which is no surprise from Chloe. Very similar to original Chloe in the sense that its a very musky and feminine scent wrapped in white florals. One of my new favourite scents!",08/25/21 19:35,lanaluvr

Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"I get mainly citrus and rose with a bit of musk in the drydown - actually I get orange flower more than anything even though it's not listed in the notes. I can't really see the 'Fleur' in this to be honest, it somehow reminds me a bit of oldschool lipstick, in a nice way. The original Chloe is the real deal for me, I don't think I'd give it up for this,but it's a pleasant alternative.",05/08/21 23:14,meliecat
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"Gosh,this is nice
A bit fresher chloe. Original has so massive perfume trail, it can be too much for daily basis. But this! Perfection, as a health worker i can easily wear this for work.it has a soft trail and stays long but close to the skin. Soft, flowery, clean. But if you love rather perfume that has a massive sillage and lastingpower, go for the original. For me i must have both.",04/23/21 23:20,tulpe
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"I love the original Chloé EDP to the moon and back, so it’s no wonder I adore this one too (possibly even more than the original, but I still need a little more time with Fleur to decide lol). They’re very similar — if you thought Chloé EDP was fresh, this is the even fresher, soapier cousin; the rose takes a backseat in favor of the citrus. Fleur de Parfum is how a classy, smart young lady who has her life together would smell like. The only thing that has stopped me from getting a full bottle by now is the weak projection and poor longevity. A tragic 2+ hours on my skin; a bit longer on clothes (slight traces of it at the end of a workday); really disappointing compared to the original, which lasts for an eternity especially on clothing.

EDIT: One week later and I’ve made up my mind — I just love this so much (yes I finally decided I like it even more than Chloé EDP!) that I’ve placed an order for a full bottle; I don’t even care about the weakass sillage & longevity anymore!",03/10/21 01:05,lemonadeblues
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"I've always thought Chloé perfumes were weird and have never worn any of them. Yesterday I tested this and I could feel it later on the sleeve of my coat and felt that I have to have this now during a hectic period at work. I needed this uplifting, dry, elegant vibe that this perfume projects, it doesn't want to seduce its more like it makes you feel you know what you are doing. I think it's a nice daytime/work perfume.",02/02/21 10:17,scentist

Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"On me, this is the reverse of Chloe l'Eau, as it is heavy on citrus with just a hint of rose. Not being a fan of citrus intensive fragrances it's not going to become a favorite. It does balance more after dry down as time passes, but I'm still left with something very light and, frankly, not different from the many citrus florals out there. For me, if it had detectable base notes, maybe I'd have a different opinion. If you like mostly citrus with just a *hint* of rose and nothing too heavy, this could be for you.",10/27/20 05:47,Wwoman
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"Something about the combination of notes in this smells very similar to Elizabeth Arden Green Tea Fig. Perhaps the bergamot. It smells very close, albeit more floral and less tangy/sharp, lacking the ivy notes. I find Green Tea Fig a bit polarizing due to that sharp sour lime beer salt note but this one is much more wearable. I will try it again for a whole day's wear. This was for a few hours.",10/24/20 11:01,lemonblue
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"Although I like citrus and I'm slowly starting to be okay with many rose scents, this wasn't for me. Rose notes can smell very expensive and rich, but sadly they can also smell really cheap and off putting. This one just all in all feels too sharp and direct ... no playfulness, not well rounded.
I tried it in summer and first even liked it because of the citrus, as soon as the rose came forward, it felt wrong. Now I tried it in autumn and again as soon as I left the house, I felt uncomfortable smelling it.

To me it's just a very cold hearted and sharp scent that does nothing for me.",10/06/20 06:10,ignorabilis
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"I love the original edp, and not always a fan of its flankers (except for the green bottled L'eau de chloé from years before and this one)

Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"What I can smell I like, it’s fruity and a little spicy with berries coming through but to be honest I think I’m anosmic to both L’Eau and this one. I took paper testers and sprayed one on my hand and one on my arm and I can barely detect both fragrances. I decided to try the entire line because I have a roller ball of the Chloe EDP and fell in love with it. However upon trying these I can barely detect them. I also tried absolu and threw away the part because it seemed to have gone off. The only one I can smell is Rose de Chloe however the sillage and longevity is already very poor, not at all like the main Chloe fragrance. I would like a mini set perhaps to suss this out.",02/25/20 20:58,Jmalone84
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"Pretty, feminine, simple, rose and citrus. The citrus is sharp at first but it settles into a fresh and flowery spring-summer scent.

Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"Fleur de parfum and chloe EDT 2015 are completely different to my nose. They share the common chloe DNA and a few citrusy top notes but that's about it. EDT is fresh bloom of white roses. Fleur de parfum, ironic to its name, has less fresh and floral quality. It's more like the quieter and more introverted sister of chloe EDP. They both share the sparkling, sweet , ""dipped-in-honey"" quality, but fleur de parfum is much softer with a touch of creaminess that smells starchy. I couldn't imagine how rice would smell as a perfume note but that must be it. It's undeniably pretty and feminine. People like me who like chloe EDP but feels it being too sweet at times would appreciate this one. Most people would probably consider this a spring/summer scent, but to me it's a fall scent due to its creaminess. If scents have temperature, EDP would be warm, EDT would be cool, and fleur de parfum would be luke warm. The sillage is soft and longevity is average. The much soapier EDT lasts longer on me.",09/19/19 23:06,Treslicious

Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,Smells like soapy clean roses with a twist of citrus. It's really refreshing and light. Nothing jumps out at you. I think this would make a lovely spring or summer scent. When worn on my skin the verbena jumped out a lot more to an almost overpowering degree. All I got was bergamot and verbenna. Kind screechy. Dry down gives me D&B Light Blue/Ghost Eclipse vibes.,05/13/19 10:56,CosmicSupernova
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"I'm less excited by a visit to a ""regular"" perfume store with designer scents than I used to be when I first became interested in the world of perfumes, because I've spoiled my nose a little with a bigger variety of fragrances, but there are still lots of designer brands I enjoy exploring, and Chloé is definitely one of them. Their scents may not be spectacularly original, but they're always well-made and enjoyable to wear, which is no small thing.

This Fleur de Parfum confirms that impression for me. It's another hassle-free, feminine fragrance that's both elegant and comfortable: a nicely tart rose/citrus/verbena combination, with a rather green, botanical feeling to it, which is something I personally like a lot. When it settles down after an hour or so, the sweeter base notes come into play, which is also nice, though the opening is the best part to my nose. This is one of those that I would have loved if I'd discovered it before I started exploring perfumes in earnest and amassed a large (decant) wardrobe of scents I really adore, I think. As it is, I like it a lot!",04/29/19 09:05,dsty
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"I really love Chloe Fleur de Parfum. You do have to get past the sharp opening citrus notes. After that, however, it's this lemony-rosy-cherry blossom smell, which I find modern and refreshing. The cherry blossom note is distinct without being overly sweet. If I'm not wrong, the Chloe EDP does not have cherry blossom, so that is what makes this one unique.",04/15/19 23:57,SoraM
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"I like the perfume. It smells rosy and citrusy all at the same time.

In a way, the 5ml sampler was more similar to the original Chloe parfum.",02/04/19 23:40,glamlove

Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"Chloe Fleur opens up with a high pitched floral that is quite indistinguishable to my nose. The top notes evoke a sense of open air on a cool morning, a blue sky and slightly cold breezes. The middle notes are leafy. Thanks to the black currant, the backbone of this scent is quite fresh and masculine, which sets this perfume apart from other floral perfumes. Overall impression is that it’s very wearable and inoffensive, but can be unique if the wearer notice the difference in details.

Everything just screams ‘meh’ - from the bottles, to the colour of the juices, to the unoriginal ads... Anyway, I received a 2ml sample of Chloe Fleur de parfum with another purchase and decided to give it a try. And... meh. It’s very generic; smells like a rose scented shampoo or body wash, but it also contains a rather nauseating citric component that smells like a cheap laundry powder. Between shampoo and detergent, there’s nothing to get excited about. I guess this could only appeal to girls who are complete novices to the world of fragrances.",06/08/18 06:54,LadyIva
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"Very nice fragrance. A work colleage wears it everyday and i asked what it was. She said it was Fleur from Chloè and then i decided to test it today. On her, it smells like a slightly spicy white floral, i don't know if it is the verbena that makes this. On me, it is a bit fresher and less flowery and a bit powdery. It reminded me of the Boss Ma Vie line. On her, it projects much better than on me. I like it, i think it is good for spring.It is a nice and feminine perfume, but not something i would buy for me.",04/17/18 07:08,raiza1990
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"If I checked Chloe fleur's notes I probably wouldn't test it.I'm not into citrus dominant perfumes and I have more than enough rosey perfumes for someone who only sometimes craves rose.
I never had original Chloe,but I have Chloe intense which I don't like much and it has nothing to do with this one
Chloe fleur is a very refreshing scent of fresh florals and citruses.rose is definitely there,but it's not a warm and heavy rose and it doesn't resemble rose water.It makes a pretty and youthful floral accord hand in hand with cherry blossom.and yes,there's verbena which plays an important role in making chloe fleur unique and more appealing to me.this floral accord has a touch of fruity,spicy and a slight green undertone and it's followed by grapefruit and bergamot.it dries down to a clean,softly powdered lemony-floral scent which is pretty enough to make me add it to my wantlist but I have to test it once again on skin
I was shocked to see lots of negative reviews.It's so nice and lovely and easy to love but not generic.it doesn't smell much soapy on me.I can get where does the cleaning product refer comes from,yes I felt that a bit too,but I didn't find it unpleasant .I love how fizzy citruses,a hint of spicy,green note(probably verbena),a pretty,feminine rose with fruity undertone,something very clean and cool like newly washed linen are mixed together and the result while is rather comforting while being energizing and refreshing
If you're looking for a citrus scent which is also very feminine,a nice blend of citruses and florals(it's not heavily floral)and fruits(just a whisper of them),spice,green notes(but not grassy ones)and clean notes) make sure to try this one.it lasted for a good couple of hours on blotter so longevity seems to be pretty good but even if it's not that good on skin I don't care as long as I like how it smells .I'm usually into gourmands and warm,heavy,sweet fragrances so I'm glad to find a fresh and clean spring and summer scent that I really enjoy",03/19/18 14:23,Soofiya
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"Zingy & Zesty . Lemon flash anyone ?
Only kidding ....
it does have a cleaning product air about it though .. but it is still pretty .
It is really spritely and energising , the citrus never goes away .. it reminds me also of a lemon merringue.
It is Soapy and musky .. clean & fresh
I have a 5 ml tester ...
i dont know if i would buy it .. but i would certainly wear it if it was a gift .
UPDATE : it also vanishes after around an hour . Basically another fleeting perfume along with most of the current perfumes . What is it with them of lately??",03/11/18 13:54,Kimmychoo 01
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"Just have a tester of this and I’m having some fun trying out things that I may not usually seek out. I do love roses, grow many varieties and surprisingly this actually smells dead on like one of the species I grow. The scent (of the rose variety) is described as “citrusy and fresh” which perfectly coincides with the notes here. I can definitely smell the peach/fruity note a little further in as well. This is probably not a fragrance I would buy unless I stumble on it at a bargain. It’s really pretty, like something to wear on a beautiful summer day with a nice dress. My personal taste runs more towards sweet gourmands, but I appreciate the airy beauty of this floral.",02/24/18 22:04,evatgirl73.1
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"Had they asked me, this would have been called Chloe Citrus.
It does share the same DNA as Chloe edp, but the rose is more in the background and topped of with a dose of lemon and bergamot. This makes the fragrance more summery and more 'fun', like sitting in the sun with a good beer.
Good times, but I personally prefer a little more depth. Or maybe it is just the citrus not developing at its best on my skin...
If you like Chloe and citrus notes, I can strongly recommend this fragrance. I'll stick to my original epd and edt.

btw: the ad with the naked lady holding the roses looks rather inconvenient...",02/21/18 04:40,Pivoinie

Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"It’s nice but rather pointless as it smells 95% like Chloe EDP and 5% like something new. If you already own Chloe EDP then buying this would be like one of those superfans who already has the CD of their favorite artist but they go ahead and buy the special UK version even though it only has one difterent song and everything else is the same.

So if you’re a Chloe superfan, go for it. If you don’t already own Chloe, then feel free to do a side by side comparison and pick your favorite. I love my Chloe so I’m always looking for a new flanker but this is too similar.",01/03/18 04:04,bibibling

Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"A gentle truly lovely scent. Mostly rose at first, then a citrus blended with something I love, a happy time. Not sure what exactly - probably a mix of bergamot, cherry blossom, and cedar. I see rice in the list. Not sure what a pure rice scent would be.

Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"It’s similar to the original Chloé EDP with loads of citrus notes thrown in but not the same scent. If you like citrus with rose you might like this one. Even L’Eau de Chloé has citrus and green notes but it’s very different from Fleur. Personally, I don’t find this special enough for the price it commands. It’s a bit weird.... with verbena, bergamot, grapefruit, peach all thrown into the Chloé EDP. After the initial citrus fruit blast, it dries down to pretty floral notes but not the same as the original and also loses its strength much sooner.",11/05/17 14:53,Fleur divina
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"Wonderful fragrance, just like the 2008 original version- it tones down just the same! As soon as the citrusy notes wear off, you can smell the same fragrance of the original Chloe EDP. Delicate, I think, is the best definition for this perfume. This is not a sweet one...not a 'bombshell fragrance'...so if you like scents like Hypnotic Poison, Flowerbomb or L Lolitta Lempicka, this is definitely not for you.
The combination of petals and slightly citrusy notes is perfect, a scent for elegant women and not at all overpowering- but still, you can smell it.I would say that you can wear anytime, day or night. It is also wearable for work- it won't disturb picky noses... I am a big fan of Chloe EDP and Love, I think both perfumes translate elegance and discretion at the same time. This one evokes really nice memories, and for me it is a must have- it is usually in my purse.",10/19/17 11:56,ballerina77

Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"Chloe Fleur de Parfum is the first flanker that doesn't smell like a Chloe EDP clone. This fragrance is so fresh and citrusy that it barely resembles the original Chloe. For this reason alone, I am rather enjoying this new release.

Chloe Fleur de Parfum would be perfect for Spring and Summer. It opens with somewhat watered-down notes of bergamot and grapefruit, followed by a soapy rose, cherry blossom and peach blend. The overall scent is super clean and laundry-fresh.

This Chloe flanker comes in the form of an EDP and has excellent longevity and moderate sillage on my skin. At this present point in time I am enjoying this fragrance much more than the original, and even more so than her many subsequent flankers.

Sadly Chloe Fleur de Parfum hasn't been well received by fans of the original Chloe. It's a lot less rosy than its predecessors and more focused on crisp citrusy accords. It reminds me a little of another now discontinued Chloe flanker, L'Eau de Chloe.

All that matters from my perspective is that I have discovered a Chloe flanker that appeals to my tastes. Although I probably wouldn't buy a bottle of Chloe Fleur de Parfum at the price it is now in-store, I would love to own a bottle at some point in the future.",04/29/17 19:30,missk
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"This is a little acidic, with a homeopathic level of spice and overall very light, which is probably a mercy because it's also synthetic and dull. It is as floral and elegant as a can of Glade. There's something stripping and detergenty about it, never mind clean. I never seem to get on with Chloe's, which is a shame as I quite like the bottles. The best I can say about this is it becomes similar to Givenchy's Jarden Precieux but without the sweetness.",03/07/17 04:23,Siv7Stars
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"I always try so hard to branch out away from my sweet perfumes. I love the boozy, rich vanillas and caramels, but I always dream of falling in love with a lovely floral.

I blind bought this on a whim after reading the notes. I had assumed the brighter, lighter opening would fit my needs. I always admired the original Chloe, but felt it unwearable to me.

The initial blast of citrus is a bit off putting, combined with the typical alcohol scent of fragrance, it takes a moment to settle before it becomes wearable. The citrus lingers through most of the day, but upon settling, the sweet, powdery rose starts to shine through.

I love how light, fresh, and easy this fragrance is. I find it extremely wearable, sweeter than the original, but still very floral. It's crisp and feminine. So happy to have this in my collection!",01/29/17 17:39,arenee92
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"I'm a great fan of the original Chloe EDP, but after testing Chloe Fleur I found myself completely enchanted by the bright citrus and warm peachy notes atop the familiar Chloe clean/pink/rose scent.

Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"Chloe Fleur de Parfum is Jardin en Mediterranee with sugar. Its weird but its nice, i would wear that, has a hint of Chloe edp too.
Also has very strong resemblance to the 2015 edt which was more floral, and Fleur is more citrusy ( the irony)
This should be easy to wear in summer because of the citrusy notes, if you are Chloe fan but Chloe is too heavy in the heat.",01/26/17 07:29,Plamka
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"Chloé Fleur de Parfum has been in my wardrobe for a while now. I went out to buy the original Chloé but that day my perfume shop ran out of stock. The nice sales lady suggested Chloé Fleur and on a whim I bought it. At first I was rather disappointed with Fleur, it was fresh and “nice” but not remarkable. It was designated to the “everyday/work/not in the mood for anything special” pile and thus it became a fresh, light, inoffensive fragrance I often wore to work. Is Chloé Fleur fresh, light and inoffensive? Absolutely. But there is so much more to this perfume than that. Recently I spritzed on some Fleur, then went about my day. I don't know if the climate, my hormones, mood and whatever else affects your skin chemistry miraculously aligned but suddenly I caught a whiff of a sweet and beautiful scent. I held up my wrist to my nose and yes, it was Chloé Fleur. Fleur came into full bloom for me (pardon the pun) on that day. Suddenly I could smell more than just the clean citrus opening. Beautiful aquatic rose peeked through the verbena and other citrus. Cherry blossom gave Fleur an exotic and almost earthy quality. The rice appeared giving Fleur a powdery quality, not a cosmetic powder but more of a slightly sweet gourmet powdery effect. It is beautiful. How did I overlook this dimension of Chloé Fleur? This is so much more than just a clean citrus scent, there is a beautiful sheer, aquatic and almost ethereal element to fleur. I think of sheer pink chiffon waving around in a warm summer breeze when I smell Fleur. Chloé Fleur is a whimsical innocent scent that displays it's ethereal beauty only in the right circumstances. This is a midsummer scent, it does well in hot weather. Do not dismiss Chloé Fleur too easily as I did, give it a fair trail and you might be pleasantly surprised. The silage is soft, it envelops you like your own little fairy dream hidden from the rest of the world. Chloé Fleur became my daily secret weapon, my portal to a summery meadow filled with flowers and joy.",01/22/17 05:18,Callisa'sBlueSky
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"On first spray I was definitely NOT a fan. The citrus was too synthetic and reminiscent of Pledge. I put Fleur down and decided to buy the original edp. However, as I continued browsing the duty-free shop, sniffing my wrist along the way, Fleur developed further. As the signature Chloe floral came through, the citrus became sweeter, fresher, and very complimentary. By the time 20 min had passed I was in love. While the two are reminiscent for sure, Fleur is certainly a fresher, more youthful take on the original.",01/21/17 23:50,ashypie2004
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"I don't like it. Very fancy botle and price, but the scent itself is nothing special,quite boring. It reminds me of some cleaning product, too soapy for me. It's like L'occitane verbena shover gel. My relationship with Chloe perfumes ends here.",01/14/17 11:10,Simone1

Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,Smells very cheap like pure alcohol. Maybe it's the green citrus in the opening. I imagine animal urine. Like that accidental whiff of a dog urinating on a sidewalk as you walk by and the scent is lifted up in the air by an current. Not a fan of verbena & grapefruit. This scent comes off as a very inexpensive cologne rather than a smooth buttery fragrance that wraps around you like a warm embrace. If you are looking for luxury this is not it. If you enjoy the adventure of a gorgeous perfume as it transforms and takes you to another era in time with every change of notes this is not it. This like a fast shower when getting ready for work. Think drive through rather than sit down 3 course meal. Something maybe a tween would wear. Not worth the money.,10/01/16 01:09,reddove
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,Smells exactly like the regular Chloé EdP.,09/01/16 09:09,snel hest
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"this is a very expensive bottle of cheap shampoo scent. or cheap hand cream. or cheap air freshener... any cheap cosmetic works, actually. feels quite watered down, but not in the immaculate, ellena-esque way; it's just synthetic, uninteresting and underwhelming. completely lacks the comforting complexity of rice which is allegedly a note here; it consists completely of of synthetic-feeling floral/herbal notes.

after reading about the launch on fragrantica a couple days ago, I came across a bottle of it at the new launches section of a cosmetics store yesterday. with the whole stress on ""powdery beige and rice"" in its PR, I had the hopes that this was an unofficial apology for love's discontinuation. upon spritzing some on my arm I was actually amazed by the fact that a commercial entity had the courage to bottle this up and sell it. I'm only hoping that their main goal is that this will be purchased as an unoffensive gift scent by confused fathers/boyfriends/males of the world.

should note that I am not a fan of chloe eau de parfum, but the house has had some big hits with me such as chloe love eau florale and roses de chloe; and I fit the brand's general aesthetic/spirit.",07/11/16 17:04,popsiclepout
Chloé Fleur de Parfum Chloé,"Hello Kon-nos91,

Awaiting your review update......

Surely there are more notes to Chloe Fleur de Parfum?
Agree with you regarding the ""sillage/lasting power"" ""early voting"", what an election year 2016 is!

P.S. I recently purchased Chloe Love Story (CLS). Honestly, am a little underwhelmed and do not know if would repurchase as lasting power on CLS is 2 to 4 hours in the Rocky Mountain summer climate.",07/10/16 06:48,jr

Eau de Fleurs Lavande Chloé,"Chloe Eau de Fleurs Lavande was really peppery to my nose. This is surprising since there aren't any peppers listed. It immediately reminded me of an old fragrance my husband used to own (can't remember if it was by Hugo Boss or not) that smelled quite peppery to me. I'm not sure if it's the lavender that smells this way, because most of the lavenders I've tried before, never smelled like this. Whoever said this could be unisex, I totally agree with.

After the ""peppery"" first sniff, the next thought I had was ""woodsy"". There ARE woods in here, so I guess I was right in that aspect. I'm at a loss because I'm not sure what I would wear this to. I definitely don't own anything like Eau de Fleurs Lavande. At least it leans sort of ""clean"" (which I like in my fragrances), but the very woodsiness/pepperiness in it, definitely throws me off. After about 5 minutes, it dies down and turns into a powdery, close-to-the-skin scent; and what was once a powerful, almost-sneeze-inducing fragrance, actually turns into a more feminine and delicate one.",05/10/13 10:26,Emerald17

Eau de Fleurs Lavande Chloé,"I like it but it makes me sneeze. A little goes a long way, I learned the hard way. I doused myself in this because it's EDT, my mistake.

Eau de Fleurs Lavande Chloé,"I feel very lucky to have found this scent when it was available. It is light, refreshing, and clean. It vaguely smells of lavender, but it's more of a sweet musky floral than a loud lavender. This is why I like this fragrance because, while I love the smell of lavender, I don't necessarily want it in a straight-up perfume. There is nothing offensive about this scent. I wish it was still available, but I might have to find a bottle online when mine runs out.",06/06/12 11:26,jordy0119

ering. I love it.",03/09/12 17:52,cdz28
Eau de Fleurs Lavande Chloé,"Can't pass up a good perfume on sale! I had sampled this one when it first came out and really liked it. However, I didn't make a purchase then as the price was kind of high which is never a deterrent if I really like something. This is Similar to Chloe EDP with a twist! This one can be unisex in my opinion. This is smells clean and has a feminine twist to it because it's kind of sweet but on the other side it's got some masculine aspects too with the vetiver and the lavender. I like lavender scents but had never encountered one that was modern that I liked. This is the exception such a beautiful scent you can really smell luxury here. It's got notes of bergamot which are prominent in the beginning. The violet leaf is also noticeable here. Almonds are perceived too but they kind of play in the background tying the whole composition. Then it turns to smells similar to Chloe but lighter with lavender as the center of the scent. Lavender just makes you feel clean. This will make you feel clean but sophisticated at the same time. You will be noticed but not in a loud kind of way. Silage is minimal and the staying power is rather weak in my skin. Great for all year round a versatile scent great for spring for summer for winter anytime of the day preferable although it can work perfectly for romantic nights too. You might want to run to your discount stores that end in XX as this appears to be discontinued.",01/12/12 10:49,ojosverdes
Eau de Fleurs Lavande Chloé,"really appreciate this fragrance a little bit less the price :-)
112 EUR for 100 ml is really expensive and even if I was surprised by the lavander note , really intensive but never disturbing , I think that the price is really too hight .
Ok Chloé is beneath this frangrance and you can recognize their signature..but on me the longevity of this fragrance is really poor.. nothing to see with Chloé Chloé eau de parfum.. on me the sillage is quite inexistant.
Any way I like it , in the top note I can fell some aromatic note.. like in eau de Cartier and even if there're no shared note with it, In the drydonw I found some similitude with Funny of Moschino.
Fleur de capucine is good also with a higher skin power stay .",08/22/11 00:22,SAMFLOWER
Eau de Fleurs Lavande Chloé,One of my favourite fragrances to wear. I have the Neroli and the Lavende and I love them both. Worth trying - the Lavender is very contemporary and feminine.,07/20/11 08:03,Cams
Eau de Fleurs Lavande Chloé,"Recently purchased a sample vial with this. It smells nice, but I can't shake the feeling that it reminds me so much of the lavender-scented bin liners we use in my house. Lmao. It's probably just my chemistry or maybe I haven't waited long enough for the fragrance to truly blossom. I only applied it about 10 minutes ago, after all. I can detect some soft, feminine elements starting to reveal themselves which I really like. :)

I find it's very easy for a lavender perfume to be similarly-scented to a disinfectant if one is not careful. This one, thankfully, steers away from that danger zone as it gradually unfolds.",07/12/11 07:04,CottonSpore80
Eau de Fleurs Lavande Chloé,"If you like Lavender, this might be a good pick. I liked Capucine most of the range, but then again not enough to buy it. The price is quite expensive and you can get one-dimensional-floral-scents for much less.",06/13/11 02:45,Habanita
Eau de Fleurs Lavande Chloé,"I'm in two minds over this fragrance. Eau de Fleurs Lavande is beautiful in a discreet and natural fashion, however I think I'd prefer it much more if it was slightly stronger, like Eau de Lavande by Annick Goutal perhaps.

The top notes are when the lavender note is at its most prominent in the composition. It jumps off the skin in a feminine and watery way, somewhat aromatic, but also quite understated. I liked the opening the best.

The heart tended to become more discreet and airy, with subtle tea notes, zesty bergamot and fresh violet leaves complimenting the core. The rich lavender diminishes slightly, a little too soon in my opinion.

The sweet almond accord, although unique and pleasant, disappointed me as I wanted more aromatic lavender rather than sugared nuts. I think this fragrance is so focused on smelling elegant and refined that it loses a lot of its character and rawness.

Eau de Fleurs Lavande started off as my favourite from this series, however by the drydown it's my least favourite. It's just too fleeting for me and I grew tired of it far too quickly. I acknowledge its purity and softness, but for me it was a little boring and forgettable.",04/30/11 22:48,missk
Eau de Fleurs Lavande Chloé,"Oh my, this is such a perfect lavender scent! Nothing beats Gris Clair from Serge Lutens, but this is a whole different approach to this wonderful note.

It is subtle, woody, deep, and very, very chic and elegant. A perfect scent for wearing in the office or other workplaces demanding discrete scents, but at the same time it has got so much character! Smells professional, but can also reveal its romantic side. An office fragrance with fantasy. It gives a herbal-woody vibe, but there is also some softness and sweetness to it coming from almonds.

If only the price was not so high... (sigh)",12/25/10 11:55,Migotka

Eau de Fleurs Lavande Chloé,"I knew it!

The top note is beautiful luxurious lavender, really powerful and modern. Not the shy herbal flower you could expect ...

Then it smells VERY similar to Voyage en Mediterranee Mimosa de L`Esterel by L`Occitane en Provence.
This is it: violet leaf + almond!

Haven't looked at the price, but I think I prefer Chloe. It's a bit less sweet and kind of more refined.

Amazing, rich floral.

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"A win of a blind buy this was for me! Absolutely love it and it’s strong and long lasting and dries down to something soft vanilla sweet musky like. My tuberose plant just bloomed a few days ago for the first time ever and it smells just like this perfume, no joke. I brought this months ago but just wanted my two cents out there about this perfume. Out of all Chloe fragrances, the Nomade line is the most beautiful and interesting to me.",09/30/25 18:46,FumeL'ver
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This reminds me so much of M.Micallef Watch, especially in the opening, because of the juicy, bubblegum cloud effect (although this has no tuberose). It’s sweet, could verge on nauseating, but it still has that Chloé chicness. This feels more subdued than Watch (initially)—which demands your attention with its immense projection—and is slightly more powdery, but I prefer Watch more, and here’s why: the scratchiness from the jasmine and the dampness of the oakmoss start to appear in the dry down, and I’m getting whiffs of neroli, bergamot and mild BO. I also experienced migraine auras (flashing lights) from this. Therefore, I’m gonna keep Watch and most likely declutter this one. It’s also not what I expected from a Nomade flanker. I thought it would smell more nature-like and fresh, not a saccharine gourmand. It’s heavy and dense, so it should feel more like a Fall/Winter scent, but mood-wise it’s more of a Spring/Summer scent…maybe an all-year fragrance, then.",08/12/25 06:31,icerise
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Another perfectly pleasant Chloe. Sweet, fresh, resinous toward the end of a whiff. It’s floral alright, but it has that slight playdoughy coconut I get semi often, and a hit of bitter from oakmoss. Chloe is just such a pleasant, boring house in my book. It’s for teenage girls on the beginning of their perfume journey, who want to smell clean, fresh, but also sweetly floral.",08/04/25 21:15,LoafyLady
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"A blind buy. I was overconfident this would be a true winner for me according to the notes and was instantly hooked by the concept of it being composed of 'all natural' ingredients'. However, I found it way too sweet and there's an accord in this fragrance I find off-putting, slightly nauseating. On my skin this fragrance projects well for five or six hours. I don't enjoy the opening or mid throughout the dry down, but I do find the resultant skin scent that remains for several more hours mildly pleasant. I've never tried the original Nomad on skin, I liked it on a test card but thought it too pricey at the time, perhaps I should give it a chance.",07/18/25 05:41,LuckyLei
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This is unique

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Smells dry, golden, and slightly dusty. Feels like slow travel through warm, open landscapes — grounded but distant.",06/27/25 06:18,amirdervishi
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This is a very pleasant easy going scent that has a niche-like addictive twist with the date notes.
The smell of white florals is almost bright and juicy at first, but the magic is in the resinous semi dry dates finally bringing the scent down to a little earthiness with a long lasting honey-like natural sweetness which is not overly sweet- just as you would expect a date would taste.
I am not sure if this flanker is supposed to be the same with Jasmin Naturelle but when I smelled the jasmin vers. at the stores I immediately fell in love with the beautiful airy floral blast and didn't notice the dates as much as this one. Honestly I remember the jasmin to be more likeable but I am happy with this jem too.
When I wear this perfume, I am transported to a dry, sun-drenched desert or rooftop of a faraway market,- though it is hot, I am cooling in the shades of loosely draped white linen just casually lounging eating away decadent dried dates for dessert.

I am also looking forward to trying the lumiere vers. as the reviews are so good. It hasn't been released where I am hopefully it is out soon before the summer ends!",06/25/25 08:19,galaeysj
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I've been wearing this a lot lately! It's never too much of a sweet vanilla and white floral headache. It's magic and it's always just right! Also, if you really smell and think about it, it gives off a green vanilla vibe. CUTE!",06/24/25 09:13,bunnificentte
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Very similar to Nomade Jasmin naturel. The difference is in the fact that in Naturelle, only natural ingredients are used. It does smell a little less like vanilla cake topping and more flowery - a bit 'warmer' I would say. But these two Nomades are very close sisters.",06/23/25 05:40,zapling
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I remember testing full ylang from the body shop 1 month after pre-ordering this and that one smelled hella delicious !! Some chloe nn reviews claimed that “it smelled more ylang” and left them quite disappointed but that gave me a spark of hope bc I was obsessed with full ylang 😭 and DUH i love ylang in my fragrances.

It’s also funny how full ylang was compared to m.micallef ylang in gold, guerlain terra cotta, and davidoff cool elixir bc chloe nn was also compared to the fragrances I mentioned.

Instead of snagging TBS full ylang, I patiently waited for this baby to come
home and finally

For the moment of truth, is the body shop full ylang and chloe nn similar? Hell yes they are AND I AM STUNNED.

I somehow enjoyed Chloé NN way better tho because it’s less sugar-sweet than TBS Full Ylang !! + TBS Full Ylang doesn’t develop quite as much as Chloé NN 🌼

Chloé NN starts off super bubblegummy + banana milkshake (yum) and as it develops, the white florals come into play, which surprisingly doesn’t overpower the peculiar, odd yet cute bubblegum banana scent. 🍌

It smells quite linear in its earlier stages but this perfume requires patience because in its full drydown? You are met with this gorgeous woody-peppery-smoky scent that gives it a leathery feel. These facets are also what makes this perfume surprisingly unisex !! 🧚

Weirdly enough, the scent reminds me of an aha.bha toner I used before that had tea tree oil lol but I don’t hate it as it gives the scent a unique fresh-green nuances despite it being all warm, dry, sweet, and woody. I think that’s what gives it its “unorthodox chypre” quality. 🌳

I’ve always wanted THAT kick of woods, smoke, and peppery-incense in my collection bc I mostly own dark feminine, medicinal, syrupy-sweet scents and this is a perfect new addition to my collection that checks all the qualities I look for in a woody perfume 🫶🏻

Proud to say that this is my 4th consecutive successful blind buy 🤭

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"The original Nomade was underwhelming (like most Chloe perfumes to me), so I was sceptical about this one, but it's much better than I thought!

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Sweet, nicely blended vanilla perfume. I get a hint of flowers but not much from the jasmine. I don't get much of the dates either, maybe just their sweetness and a tiny hint of oriental notes. There was something slightly sour in it, could be the plums?

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Utterly BEAUTIFUL perfume! One of the best summer scents out there! Perfect balance between white flowers and sweetness.

It is its own scent and nothing I have smelled before. its creamy, smooth, soft, intriguing. my new signature scent. I've seen some reviews sayinf it doesn't last but thats something I'm willing to compromise on as it just smells devine.
I think this smells just like those bubblegums from childhood that used to come with little fake tattoos for the skin. I am absolutely in love with it.",02/17/25 13:20,Indi96

And, just when you think it's gonna go too sweet and basic vanilla blah as it starts to dry down, it turns to a nougaty type of softly green and very gently woody vanilla - I don't even know.

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"When I originally bought this I liked it, but wasn't blown away. I put it in the back of my closet to age and try again in the colder months, and now I'm wow'ed by this perfume! Upon initial spray, I'm getting a thick brown sweetness from the earthy dates. It is very very sweet, but not overpowering and not sickening. The gentle spiciness from the freesia is absolutely DIVINE. Combined with egyptian jasmine? Chef's kiss. You get the best part of the floral notes without this actually smelling like a floral perfume.

I'm a one-spray girly and let me tell you, the sillage is crazy on this perfume. For the most part, I don't smell it on me (which is my goal), but every time I turn my head, stand up, or bend over I'm blessed with a waft of warm, cozy fragrance that just makes me happy.

Sweet, earthy, rich… and that jasmine is just exquisite. I don’t find it similar to the original Nomade (which I also own and love). This is probably my favourite of the entire line, and they’re all pretty amazing.",09/29/24 13:08,Lois K
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This was lovely until I realized that it smells like bananas :D I sold it. I really don't want to smell like bananas. If you want something that is heavy on the sweet dates, go for Lattafa Khamrah - that perfume gave me what I wished for from this one.

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I ordered a travel spray of this fragrance with other travel sprays and samples so maybe there was a mix up between the fragrances but this smells very middle eastern to me. Veeeery spicy, cinnamon and all, reminds me of fall and Christmas. Maybe it's the dates, because it's pretty similar to Khamrah to my nose, spices and sweet dates. I like it, since I like Khamrah a lot, but I just wasn't expecting this kind ot scent profile from this fragrance, so I am a bit disappointed.",09/03/24 13:02,strawberrystar
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I’m so in love with this perfume. It became one of my favourites so fast. Such a shame I didn’t give it a try earlier. Everyone around me loved it as well. It’s very true to the notes and the name. Personally, I love it because it fits my personality and looks, which was the comment I got from my family and friends too. I just love it in a very sentimental way now.",08/28/24 23:06,zori

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"The rave reviews have me anxious to test, but I can't seem to find it anywhere. Has it been discontinued?? There are other variations, but apparently they don't compare to this...",08/02/24 11:44,ackeyjopes
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This is a beautiful perfume (period). I've smelled the Nomade line, and this one has a different DNA. It leans less woody and more towards an interesting sweet/summer vibe. It doesn’t smell like anything I've experienced before, I believe the dates+jasmin combo give it an unexpected twist. BUT it is not a floral leaning perfume. And it doesn't have that ""perfumey smell"" that 75% of stores smell like.
To be absolutely fair, the longevity isn't great. If you're only after the juice, I'd say it's a special, unique fragrance among designer perfumes, but 2 hours down the line, I cant smell it anymore on the skin. Still, an absolutely gorgeous fragrance.",07/25/24 12:54,biferrari7
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Oh my.. This scent it so beautiful. Love at first spray, completely. I’m a redhead and I think this one suits me so well. Its warmth and spiciness 😻 I can’t wait to re-apply from the sample while I wait for my 50 ml to arrive (it was sold out in the shop but it was possible to order it home). But I’m too afraid the sample will get empty before it arrives 🤭😂

To me it smells expensive and feminine. The longevity and sillage isn’t as strong as I wish it was. I haven’t tested the intense version but will consider it when my naturelle bottle is empty.

Edit: I had to try the intense version and it’s not for me. I see many reviews about how alike they are but I do not agree. I tried spraying them on each arm without knowing which one was intense or naturelle. I liked naturelle the most because it’s more round, soft, coconut-like. I know it’s to be expected that an intense version is.. Yeah intense. But this one was not for me",07/20/24 12:22,smellsliketeensprite
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"The opening is almost exclusively fruity to me. I learned here it's Mirabelle. Belonging to the plum family this is a very juicy note. Very sweet, too, probably where the dates come into play. If it stayed like this, it would be a love. Unfortunately, those fresh fruity notes disappear after a short while and the fragrance drifts off into a powdery, sugary vanilla, that's just a little too intense and too basic for me to love it. It's not disgusting or anything like that, but there's other fragrances at this price point that will give me longer lasting joy.",07/20/24 03:20,Poudery

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"i have fallen irrevocably in love with this perfume. it’s so sweet and youthful yet still somehow earthy and mature. it’s carolyn bessette kennedy on a beach trip. it’s the air-conditioned lobby of a remodeled jugend hotel. it’s the end of cleaning day, windows wide open to let the breeze in, defrosting a piece of cake to reward yourself. it’s a night in an ancient city with the heat from the busy day still lingering. it’s a forest after rain. it’s everything. made an account just for her",06/25/24 12:20,ryebreadgirl
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"tested today bc i became slightly obsessed with the idea of this fragrance and i was like ‘no you’re going to smell it before you buy it!’ so i did. and it was nothing like i expected. this straight up smells like a banana milkshake or foamy bananas which i weirdly like a lot. it’s very sweet but has a warm comforting aura honestly it could be a ‘your skin but better’ scent. by the way it’s called ‘jasmin natural’ they renamed it idk why esp since it’s such a recent release no one even had time to get used to the original name.
anyway i think this might be a purchase. it’s an extremely safe blind buy,completely noninvasive,it just smells great. oh and it’s not alcoholy/sharp at all there’s a creaminess/softness to it that is lovely
i keep smelling it on my hand and i just smells good i can’t describe it any other way it’s just rly good like a sweet creamy body lotion",06/08/24 08:53,fuzzyduckling
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I like it very much, it's a really happy scent and it stays on skin for a long time, which is awesome nowadays when nothing lasts. It's a gem imo! I'd say it's a sophisticated fruity floral fragrance, never being too sweet nor cloying. It's a nice blend of dates, mirabelle and jasmine with a touch of sandalwood, which may resembles the coconut smell that many are talking about. I don't think it's similar to Terracotta Guerlain, this one is way more indolic and sultry.",05/30/24 14:13,Stefmn
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I've been wearing this fragrance for a year and a half now. It was a mostly blind buy. I smelt it on paper and instantly had to buy. Definitely lucky that it smelt the same on my skin, maybe even a bit better.

I'm not sure what I'm smelling, but something smells so earthy and mossy (must be the oakmoss?), but it's mingled with the vanilla (which always comes out very strong on me), but it's a beautiful scent. Some days freesia comes out very prominently and other days it's the Jasmine and I have no idea why, but regardless, I love how slightly interchangable the notes can be.

My bottle is coming to an end and I wasn't sure if I wanted to repurchase, but, after wearing this on vacation in a colder climate, I've fallen in love with this scent all over again.

Definitely a repurchase.",04/24/24 04:33,ZK87
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"While I like Nomade, I don't understand this perfume. To my nose this is a weird mixture. Mirabelle, dates, and jasmine somehow don't fit for my liking. Overall I smell fresh, green, very sweet, yet sour-bitter... something, with addition with something unnaturally plastic/synthetic.
Did they throw a strawberry bubblegum or tuberose in here as well???
I think if you are a fan of Mugler Allien, give it a sniff, they are a family.",04/22/24 12:47,sisina96rv
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Wow sadly this isn’t what I was expecting. I enjoy the nouveau chypre qualities of Nomade EDP and Nomade Absolu, but this gives me Estée Lauder x Tom Ford Bronze Goddess 2011 (which I enjoyed). I get no mirabelle, no dates, but a powdery, sweet, white floral, coconut bomb. I was expecting more of a bohemian vibe. Glad I opted for a decant.",04/19/24 14:44,tracy.p.dvm
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"A lovely perfume.

I especially smell vanilla and sandalwood which gives a powdery and warm side to the whole. There is also a sweet side brought by the delicious mirabelle plum and the dates (even if I cannot perceive those last).

The name of the perfume reminded me of something quite heavy and spicy but in fact it is very soft. For all seasons in my opinion. On the other hand, I find the staying power quite weak and the sillage non-existent, which is a bit problematic for me.",04/14/24 23:52,Saveria

Elegant, sweet, mysterious, warm and sexy! Definitely a woman scent",03/28/24 05:41,elenagr22
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I blind bought this. The ai says to not do that but to me, this is a very likeable, crowd pleasing scent.
I think it's unique as far as perfumes go and I've gotten compliments on it but when i first smelled it all I could think was ""this smells like walking into a Lush store"". I don't think there are many perfumes like this but to me it still smells... generic if that makes sense. A bit boring. But I still like wearing it lol.

It's sweet but not too sweet, I definitely get the date note but I don't think this is a ""fruity"" fragrance.
It's a bit aromatic, kind of smells like a spa but if you add vanilla and sweetness.
It's definitely not your typical girly girl designer scent but I'd say it's feminine and very pleasant. It smells more like a free spirit kind of woman but still classy.
You could wear this all year round but it gives me spring vibes or maybe for summer evenings, but not in a going out clubbing type of way. More like sitting on the beach and watching the sunset.
Currently this is my daytime scent until I find something better.",03/28/24 03:32,ang3l3s
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This is not very closely related to Nomade in my opinion. It does toe the line between chypre and gourmand, earthy and spicy and sweet all at once. You get a soft jasmine, syrupy date, cinnamon (?), and a faint oakmoss. It's very unique but I'm not a fan.",03/26/24 11:34,clairesque
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I prefer this over classic Nomade EDP and its flankers. I smell a beautiful honeyed jam of dates and plums with a hint of jasmine. Sweet, delicious, uplifting, not cloying. The oak moss note is noticeable but not as overpowering as in Nomade EDP.
The projection is moderate, the longevity is ok. A bit overpriced. Beautiful, nonetheless.

Upd. Nevermind, the original Nomade’s DNA has grown on me, so I ended up getting Nomade EDT and Nomade Absolu, EDP is on the way as well. It just needs chilly and windy weather to really blossom. And Chloe’s Cedrus seems to have the same DNA, could’ve been one of the Nomade’s flankers easily.
Though Jasmin Naturelle, Naturelle and Nuit D’Egypt have less in common with the original Chloe Nomade’s DNA.",03/25/24 09:05,ASunday193
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This is such a wonderful summer scent and long lasting and strong. There has to be coconut in the notes even though it’s not listed. I also own the natural Jasmin intense version and I don’t see many people comparing the two. The jasmine intense has a heavier sweet / cinnamon note in the dry down and more Jasmine in the opening. Probably better for winter. This one the nonade Naturelle is COCONUT and it’s heaven, smells just like Estée Lauder Bronze Goddess eau fraiche but way stronger.👍 Both Nomade scents are very different to each other so you can happily own both, one for summer and one for winter 🙌",03/20/24 07:10,katiesimpsonhair
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This is a jasmine fragrance. A pretty, non-indolic jasmine. Quite different than the first two nomads which are fresher and sharper. I like those but they can give a sour vibe in the dry down where this is all pretty girl all the time.",03/06/24 16:34,snoopy2
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Because I’m obsessed with this Nomade line, I own every iteration. I can pick up on the sweeter notes in this fragrance, but there’s something that smells like cedar to me.

This one is distinct from the original, but it’s still quite lovely.",02/21/24 11:36,FreddieMercury'sCat
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,This is so pretty! It's completely different from the OG which I don't particularly like so I opted to buy a decant first because the date accord was intriguing. Nomade Naturelle is what I wanted Valentino BIR Intense to be. This has creamy jasmine and doesn't come of as indolic like BIR Intense. I love the sweetness it has without being gourmand. This is on my list for a full bottle!,02/17/24 09:07,Violet28
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I've been so surprised by every thing about this. I got a tester of it with an order of something totally unrelated. I'm familiar with the original chloé perfume so I was expecting something sort of similar. Was also intrigued by what 'naturelle' would mean for the smell, I assumed (wrongly) it would mean it was citrus or herbal smelling, for some reason. Or maybe woody? I'm not 100% sure what I was expecting to be honest.
I was verrrrrrry surprised by my first sniff. First thing I thought was 'naturelle'? I don't think so... Right off the bat it is very sweet, as the notes would suggest. So I was caught off guard by that. I don't usually consider myself a fan of sweet fragrances at all, so I very quickly wrote it off thinking nope, not for me. But then, as I kept smelling it, I realised I had literally never smelled anything remotely similar to this composition before.

It's sweet like a piece of halva or maybe sweet like a perfect piece of fruit would be, how something is sweet because it has grown in abundant sunshine. Like the way honey sweetens tea, not sugar. And then it's floral, but not like shampoo or perfume, but like nectar or pollen, like walking past a jasmine bush in summer. It smells juicy. It's got warmth from the base of sandalwood and vanilla, which i usually am not a fan of much, but here same thing! It smells like a vanilla bean pod, not like vanilla ice cream. It smells like something not man-made.

As I caught whiffs of it, I realised I was becoming hooked, which is all I look for in a fragrance really. Despite it being very sweet and quite floral, it's never too much, not to me anyway. It's actually something I've been looking for for a long time; it's comforting and cosy, but it's also light and breezy. It's soft, it has no sharpness, still alive and interesting though.

Suffice to say, I was unexpectedly sold and I was so confused about it. It's what has been missing from my perfume collection, and despite this analysis I still can't put my finger on what exactly is so lovely to me about it. The comments I've had on it have all been positive, the worst being a friend telling me she loves it as a smell but wouldn't wear it on herself as it doesn't smell very 'perfumy'. Which as a molecule girlie (juliette has a gun, glossier you, another 13 etc.) I liked alot.

Imagery: Pink and yellow to me. Quite laid back. Whoever is wearing this eats whole foods, wears the same jewellery every day and lives at their own pace. Lots of cashmere and linen, long wool coats in winter. Plays chess perhaps, and has an apartment with big windows on a tree lined sunny street. She's an easy laugher and is beautiful in a way that makes you want to look not like her precisely, but more like yourself. Would literally be the perfect signature scent! Could not see this on a man but always willing to be proven wrong.

Also smells slightly like ski wax sometimes but that's quite specific.

Edit after a year: I go nose blind to this almost immediately so I save it for occasional use now and then",02/01/24 16:40,jess.sophie.cluse

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Wow, stunning. Simple, beautiful, well balanced sweet and summery. Smells quality. It’s a cold wet windy cloudy January day today and this smells like liquid summer sunshine in a bottle. Definitely more floral than sunscreen, but the florals are so soft and natural smelling, no sharpness to them at all. Slightly tropical. It isn’t wild or groundbreaking, and it isn’t the most unique fragrance, but truly beautiful and good quality. I smell tiare and gardenia somehow? I’m pretty into florals and have a garden full of jasmine and gardenia, this doesn’t smell like typical star jasmine to me, something more exotic. I’m used to freesia smelling more strong and sharp to me too, typically not my favorite floral in perfume, but I can’t quite detect it here. To me it has just the right amount of sweetness for an any day, any time grab. The tartness of the mirabelle is toned down compared to the other flankers, replaced with a light fresh vanilla. I can sometimes smell the dates but they’re pretty mellow. I get a lot of monoi vibes. I’ve had trouble finding a good performing quality monoi type scent but this blend really feels like what I’ve been looking for. May finally be able to declutter a few duds.",01/23/24 17:03,wondervalley666
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"At first, I love all the Nomade versions but the ones I've smelled always end up smelling like sweat in the dry-down, in this one it's probably the wood notes mixed with the moss.

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This juice was everything I was looking for in a perfume. I'm not crazy for overly floral perfumes, and I think the florals in this are perfectly balanced with the fruity and woody aspects in this iteration of nomade. A friend recommended this, knowing I'm a sucker for sandalwood and vanilla, and yet wanting something Sexier than your run of the mill basic scents. They purchased a sample for me, and it was immediately over. I had to have the full size.
Sweet, spicey, sexy, mature, yet I feel its not reserved to any one age group. I also feel this is appropriate for any time of day, or season. I'm in love!",01/18/24 09:48,OlfactOrFiction
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"The jasmine and freesia are dominant and almost overpowering on my skin. I just learned I'm not a big fan of the freesia jasmine combo.

I was really drawn to test this fragrance due to to the date and plum notes listed, however I can't smell them, other than to say they make the florals sweet. Not too sweet though, just a touch sweet.

This smells like pure summer, and my brain makes the jump to smelling coconut. This really reminds me of Rio de Janeiro's Rio Radiance, and will layer really well with that cream or a perfume which smells like coconut milk for summer.",01/02/24 19:57,fridaymood

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This is my favorite fragrance of all time. I’m a perfume lover, I’ve been collecting since I was 8 years old. Until I got this fragrance, I had never found anything that could be my signature. I was looking for a clean, elegant, sweet fragrance that could work in every weather. I honestly didn’t think I would ever find what I was looking for but I stand corrected. The dates and mirabelle make the opening sweet and fruity, but not too loud. I have never found a fragrance with dates in it which adds to the uniqueness of this scent. The dry down is what truly made me fall in love with this fragrance though. Soft, feminine, pretty, and absolutely breathtaking. It’s exactly what I imagine comfort being if it were a scent. This fragrance stays with me all day and no one around me ever gets a headache from it including myself. I could not be happier with this purchase, and I intend on rebuying this for the rest of my life!",12/22/23 16:48,Selinat2023
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This smells wonderful - it’s a great all rounder & I feel it would suit all seasons. Its a recent purchase for me & the warm vanilla and oak moss lend itself to cold seasons but the fruitiness and jasmine could work well in warm weather too.

It’s sweet & fruity from the sticky dates and tangy mirabelle plums, floral from jasmine and freesia then dries down to a delicious woody warm vanilla.

I prefer this to the other Nomades, it smells so unique & its the kind of scent that could easily become your signature perfume.

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I did a spray on a tester strip in duty-free then tucked it in my passport and forgot about it. When I came across it again, I was obsessed, but couldn't remember which perfume it was! I finally worked out it was this one, luckily re-tested to get the right Nomade as this is very different from the others. Reading the notes is quite interesting as I never thought I was a sweet perfume lover, I normally go for more androgynous wood scents. I instantly get coconut and sunblock and it's 100% a summer fragrance for me, I haven't worn it into Autumn and Winter. It makes me think of a golden sunset in the Med, a warm evening when you put on a long flowy dress for a relaxed dinner by the water. I layer it with the Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse body oil for longevity and the neroli scent compliments Nomade nicely.",12/16/23 06:25,Return2Scenter

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Am I the only one who thinks this is similar to Guerlain's Lui? Looking at the list of notes, they are very distant cousins, smelling them side-by-side they are sisters. In all honesty, I find neither a summery, outdoorsy scent - both are more autumnal, cuddly. Very intimate, comforting skin scents, though Lui is the older, louder sister. Nomade Naturelle is gentler: more unobtrusive, more wholesome. I must say I haven't really figured out the dates in this - if I wouldn't know I wouldn't have guessed in a million years. It is sweet though, and nutty, with a hint of almonds.

I bought this on the fly. Quite literally, at the airport. On the plane I kept sniffing my arm, thinking I had made a big mistake and pondering how to get at least some of my money back. Now, though, I am SO glad I hung on to it. With the cooler weather and the similarity to Lui, I am actually loving it.

However, I personally see no similarity between the 2. While Portrayal is a cold perfume, although it has sweetness from vanilla, the elemi note gives it a balsamic, almost minty, refreshing note, NN is extremelly warm and sweet.

I am not contradicting @mistrall below, I just find it very interesting how different perceptions may be sometimes. No matter how, both perfumes are really good ones and worth having and enjoying.",08/10/23 20:55,Cherry Bloom

Micallef Ylang in Gold but with that Mirabelle sweet slightly pear-ish fruit shining. Both can be worn all year round which is hard to do. It’s substantial and projecting enough to work in the cold and not cloying to work in the heat. It’s sweet but not too much and not your typical designer kind of sweet, but it is very wearable. The dates work well in this too and contributes to that natural sweetness lol and that ylang ylang/banana custard illusion.",07/21/23 04:16,jassca99
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"What kinda of sorcery is this? The blend of dates and mirabelles smells like banana!
This scent is a beautiful take on the bubblegum genre...usually they come as raspberry, strawberry, melon or grape focused (and often it is tuberose and other flowers that give the effect), but this one is certainly a banana bubblegum!
The jasmine in it is dirtied by the sandalwood which also results almost white chocolaty, and a crystal like oakmoss seals the deal with a classy twist! In the dry down you can almost smell a banana smoothie, and much powder! A very fluffy cloud of powder!
What a strange little concoction! Quite unique cosidering the brand portfolio.
It's like joy in a bottle! It will surely appeal to their audience, Chloe always had a romantic femininity, an elegance that we can define as delicate and light hearted. It smells joung and girly without being juvenile.

To tell it all, if you smell it carefully you can clearly understand that there is a date note in the perfume, their sweetness and texture is unmistakable...my father worked in Algeria and always brought back with him huge packs of dates, just picked. They were so so sticky, as full of honey, but that substance came directly from the dates...no additives. Never found that good quality again.
If you are curious about what kind of smell they can have in a perfume maybe this Nomade Naturelle version is a mediocre start, for a more pure and concentrated dates scent we have to go niche, but taken on his own Chloe Nomade Naturelle was a big surprise for me and a good one at that.

To pick it apart a little more I would say that the opening is extra fruity, with mirabelle and date quite recognisable, plus a general fruitiness that has something of yellow melon and peach too!
At this stage it is not much sweet, luckly, and it smells more like solid fruits then juice or watery, which again is less common to find.
The middle is still much fruity but the jasmine is potent, little by little becomes the major player and it smells creamy and little ""dirtied"" by the base of sandalwood. It is much similar to the jasmine in Trussardi Pure Jasmine (they share a lot this two perfumes), with a white chocolate tinge on it, airy but at the same time with a considerable weight and creaminess to it. I don't particulary smell the fresia, maybe it's just simply fruity? There is none of its greenness or spiciness, just airy florals.
The sandalwood in this perfume is complex smelling, specially in the final part of dry down. In this middle stage of the scent it is a little dirty but it also has something of coconutty, a characteristic that I much enjoy...and I find it almost lactonic (as if a proper milk/whipped cream accord were present), I am sure the sweet and woody vanilla helps a lot in this regard; the result is gourmand/cocktail verging between candy, beverage and fruity dessert! Before the effect becomes too edible or unberable here comes the okamoss in the base, well blended with the rest, you can not isolate the note, and it soffuses the sweetness and all the notes masterfully! It's not dry or airy at all this type of oakmoss, it is modern and almost crystalline.
Dry down is woody and powdery too...the powdery part is much fluffy and cloudy, like a mimosa effect, probably coming from the well blended vanilla, but to tell it all there is a vague yellow flower tinge in the composition.
At some point the dry down even smells a bit spicy, as if a light sprinkle of cinnamon could be in it...probably it is again the sandalwood that has complexity, it remainds me of some apple pie and Christmasy sweets, but it is not a central characteristic.
I have noticed that the flowers and the sandalwood smell a bit dirty, almost sweet smoked/incensed but in a very light, almost imperceptible manner, maybe something similar to styrax or honey could have been lightly used, or it is simply the sandalwood or the vanilla that has more then one undertone...it could even be the dates! In any case, dry down is addictive and persistent.


The mood of the fragrance is extra playful, filtry and feminine. It has the name Nomade but this Naturelle version has almost nothing of the Nomade original line, they probably share just the mirabelle, the florals and that crystal oakmoss, the original Nomade is ultra classy and elegant while still being lightly fruity, this one is trendy and girly.
I think it gives happy vibes, even vacation vibes...there is something slitghly tropical (we could even say beachy) more so then ""nomade"". The result is light hearted but posh, something I could see on a trendy woman, dressed colorfully and strolling around in a hot city during summer, enjoying shopping and fruity coktails!
It's so summery and solar this fragrance! And happy!

I don't think this suits my style that much but I like it a lot! Maybe I can wear it when I want to feel different...more happy and carefree, pairing it with some of those abstract black and white prints, a colorfull silky top and huge statements earring! Just to play around being someone else for a couple of hours...and while at it go shopping for some good candies, creating bubble with my chewing gum like a child...it could be fun!
You gotta love when perfumes inspire you to such things! It is a testament to their quality and artistry.

Sometimes, when a perfume is particulary well done or enjoyable it sends flashes of color in my head, as if I percive it in color and this time they range from light yellow to ocher to rusty tones of orange and sand, and some green too...very vivid more so then muted or ""powdery"" colors, the notes present speak true to their essence in this sense.

Performance wasn't the greatest in terms of both lasting and sillage, but it is for the best, had this been more potent I could have not wear it, I have only a 15ml decant but I don't like leaving perfume unused, so it plays in my favor.
Be careful of one thing though...this has to work with your chemistry, on my friend that banana accord (plus the milky parts) turned acid and it smelled like vomit (a bit) so if you can try it first!

EDIT: I heard rumors of a discontinuation but it is available on shop such as Sephora or Lookfanatstic that usually don't sell discontinued ones so I doubt it, it is also sold on the gray market for the standard price so I think it is still in production.",06/20/23 10:08,Frabra88
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I absolutely love it! I wore it everyday, especially in the evening during a trip to a greek island! All day with a caftan and sandals.. this smells heavenly, sweet but not over powering, like creamy coconut..At the dry down it is balsamic like i smell insence but not listed! Get your hands on it, i've been told it is discontinued. Well done Chloe.",06/05/23 12:22,elenian
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I love this perfume. It smells fresh, sweet and summery. But at the same time, there is something soothing and comforting about it that makes it also suitable during colder months.

Above all, the jasmine scent is most prominent. But it is soft and not that strong.",06/05/23 06:13,Jennaflareon

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum by Chloé পারফিউমটি রিলিজের পর থেকেই আমার Wishlist-এ ছিল। তবে আমি Blind Buy করতে চাচ্ছিলাম না। গতবছর মালদ্বীপ এয়ারপোর্টে আমি পারফিউমটি প্রথম ট্রাই করি এবং it was love at first sniff 😍 আর অবশেষে এই বছর আমি পারফিউমটি আমার কালেকশনে add করতে পেরেছি আলহামদুলিল্লাহ।

পারফিউমটি রিলিজের আর্টিকেলে পারফিউমটির নোটগুলো দেখেই আমার মনে হয়েছিল Chloé Nomade Naturelle EDP অনেক সুন্দর এবং এই Lineup-এর অন্য পারফিউমগুলো থেকে একদম আলাদা হবে। Chloé Nomade Naturelle EDP -এর নোটগুলো হচ্ছে:

Chloé Nomade Naturelle EDP -এর স্মেল ফ্রেশ ও সুইটের পারফেক্ট ব্যালেন্স। এখানে Mirabelle Plum, Jasmine ও Freesia ফ্রেশনেস এড করেছে আর Dates ও Vanilla সুইটনেস এড করেছে। তাই এটি আমাদের দেশের summer ও spring -এর জন্য পারফেক্ট। বিশেষ করে যারা ফ্রেশ ফ্রুটি ফ্লোরাল কিন্তু মিষ্টি/সুইট পারফিউম পছন্দ করেন তাদের জন্য Chloé Nomade Naturelle EDP পারফেক্ট। অনেকেই এই পারফিউমটি থেকে Coconut-এর স্মেল পায়,তবে আমি পাইনি। আমার কাছে মনে হয়েছে এটির স্মেল ওপেনিং-এ কোন মজার মিষ্টি ফ্রুটি Dessert -এর মত এবং এরপর Jasmine ও অন্যান্য নোটের ব্লেন্ডিং থেকে ফ্রেশ Summer Beach টাইপের ভাইব পাই আমি। এক কথায় অসাধারণ ব্লেন্ডিং!
আমি এই ২০২৩-এ রিলিজ হওয়া Chloé Nomade Jasmine Naturelle Intense ও Chloé Nomade Naturelle EDP পাশাপাশি স্কীন টেস্ট করেছি এবং আমার কাছে ব্যক্তিগতভাবে মনে হয়েছে Chloé Nomade Naturelle EDP বেশি সুন্দর এবং আকর্ষণীয়। এটি আমাদের দেশের আবহাওয়ায় বেশি ভালো পারফর্ম করে। আর এটি একটি Signature Scent Worthy পারফিউম।

পারফিউমটি ব্যবহার করে আমি ৭-৮ ঘন্টার মত longevity পেয়েছি। তবে কাপড়ে স্মেল wash না করা পর্যন্ত ছিল। Chloé Nomade Naturelle EDP -এর প্রোজেকশন মডারেট। সাধারণত প্রথম কয়েক ঘণ্টা একহাত দুরত্ব পর্যন্ত এটি প্রোজেক্ট করে। এরপর আস্তে আস্তে স্কীনসেন্ট হয়ে যায়।

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I'm very surprised tuberose is not listed in this one as on me it's straight up bubblegum tuberose.
Super fresh, not too sweet, very likable and pretty.
I'm putting it in my wishlist.",05/14/23 05:09,artsyellie
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Starts sweet and jasminy. Then comes a blast of...banana?!! This one smells too much tuberose, so its not for me. Tuberose can be tricky for me. But this perfume smells too peculiar and mature. Cloying.",05/13/23 06:51,Cathped

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Had a couple of wear tests and at first I found it to be very refreshing, slightly sweet and a little bit herbal even. Great for summer. But the more I wore it, the sweeter it got to the point it made me nauseated. Also, is it getting discontinued?? I see it less and less in stores and online where I live.",04/30/23 05:41,VelG
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This is beautiful, it's a sticky sweet jasmine but I don't find it sickly or cloying, or too sharp. The sticky sweetness is from the date note which is almost honey like in texture.
The dry down is beautiful, sweet, soft, vanilla, creamy with a gentle wave of jasmine.
As soon as I tested this I knew it was familiar and nostalgic but I couldn't place where I knew the scent from - it took me several hours to work it out, but it strongly reminds me of Batiste Blush scent of dry shampoo, but far more nuanced and complex. It drove me mad not being able to place it.
But if you enjoy the Batiste Blush scent in the pink bottle, you will probably enjoy this perfume very much! (Bear in mind that the last time I used Batiste was probably in 2007?! They may have changed the scent!)
Edit: I have very recently smelled Narciso Rodriguez Musk Noir on a tester strip and it reminded me of this, they share similar qualities. I've realised it must be the plum note in NR is reminding me of the Mirabelle plum note in here, I didn't realise that this is what plum smells like in perfumery! So it makes sense that this smells more fruity, I just didn't realise that it's a fruity plum note.",04/30/23 02:56,Skylakagetis
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I blind bought this based on hours of research and reading reviews. Absolutely LOVE IT!
It reminds me of a summer night out somewhere in the Mediterranean, close to nature with its sun touched, various trees and flowers, and a gentle sea breeze that brings all the combined scents in the air into one. Jasmine, soft, sweet, feminine and a tiny bit mysterious.
A gem. A little pricey but so worth it.
I am 40+ and very particular with my scents. :-)",04/28/23 11:20,HellyBopPop
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I really like this perfume, i was however really surprised with the first sniff as it smelled nothing like i expected. To me it smells very woody to me which i don’t mind, it almost smells like miswak (teeth cleaning stick) which i also didn’t mind as it’s a very nostalgic scent.

I will say i’m very disappointed i don’t smell any dates, i used sticky dates body wash from lush and eat dates on the daily so the thought of smelling like a date was very appealing. I still really like the perfume and i’m starting to smell more of the vanilla as i keep trying it. Also i should note it doesn’t really last long on me i sprayed it on last night and didn’t smell it when i woke up, which usually isn’t the case with some of my other perfumes.

That’s all, i do recommend u smell it before buying it, it was a blind buy for me but i got lucky that i liked it. It’s a very unique scent and it may not be everyone’s taste so so smell it first!",04/18/23 04:45,maryjane7
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I get a beachy vibe from it. I think this is more of a summer scent. It is very powerful, 2 sprays were more than enough for me. IMO, It is definitely better than the original. It’s a designer perfume but has niche quality. I don’t quite like oakmoss in the base, but it’s alright. I’ll repurchase!",04/13/23 18:30,another_52hz_whale
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This should have been a separate launch! I fell *hard* in love on the first sniff and bought my bottle after I finished my sample.
For me - it's a smooth jasmine scent with dates playing the ""something different"" note. It's feminine, gorgeous. I can smell it on the bride. Signature-scent worthy.
Only drawback is the lasting power. Could be a bit better but I don't mind to overspray.
Vibes: spring/summer jasmine, slightly but not sickly sweet, signature-worthy
Form: 2ml sample and 75ml bottle",04/08/23 14:05,Petula009
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I just confirmed with Chloe (via a boutique here in Los Angeles) that this has been discontinued. I'm so sad. It's such a lovely fragrance.

When I first smelled it last year, near the start of my fragrance journey, I thought it was just another sweet and kind of boring designer perfume. But as my nose has developed, I started to appreciate it more. For me now, it is a comforting blend of warm and sweet and exotic and creamy. I haven't smelled anything quite like it, maybe because of the date note. Speaking of that date note, I compared it with an actual bag of dates and it really does capture the depth and richness of that almost-musty sweetness.

I'm wondering if they just added in a bunch more jasmine and that's what we're getting with the Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense new release? I really hope they used the same date accord and didn't drown it out with white florals (I love white florals but still). It's the same perfumer so I'm not giving up hope just yet!!",03/29/23 12:05,sandra_101
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"The more I wear it, the more I love it. It is a very sophisticated fragrance despite being very sweet. Not juvenile in the slightest, very sophisticated - have I mentioned this already? I would't call it mature, it is very modern but not mainstream. I did not receive compliments for it but I adore it and makes me feel classy and special.

Such a lovely discovery and great blind buy. At first I kinda liked it, then liked it more, then loved it, now I want a bigger bottle. All in a bit more than one week...",03/27/23 06:46,Cherry Bloom
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"It’s a really good designer fragrance! Extremely wearable, it gives me warm day at the beach vibes, while eating a juicy, sweet piece of fruit.

The combination of dates and mirabelle plum is gorgeous, one gives the fragrance sweetness, while the other one keeps it juicy and summery.

I also get a bit of an oriental feel, probably because of the dates accord.

But what lives throughout the entire lifespan of this fragrance is its creaminess, which is what transported me to the beach. It’s like you’re enveloped in this luxurious lotion, while enjoying the juicy sweet fruit. I love it!

I also think a solar accord should have been mentioned in the list of accords for this fragrance. Beautiful, I have a feeling I’ll be wearing a lot of this one this summer! Very successful blind buy!",03/24/23 03:42,Aikipy
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Now, after a few days of wearing it, i can rightfully tell my opinion. This is a very nice, smooth fragrance, so well done, I've read about some coconutty feel to it and I totally agree. On the edge of being headache inducing but not effectively creating one. I've heard also about it's niche quality. I agree to that also.

Longevity is very good but sillagr is poor. No worries, you ypurself will feel it almost the whole day. I really really like it. I ve got the 30 ml cute little bottle and see if i miss it once it's over. But i seriously thinking about getting a bigger bottle already.

Really good one this Nomade flanker",03/22/23 07:17,Cherry Bloom
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I'm on the fence about this one.
I don't particularly care for the opening which kind of catches in my throat due to the fruity top notes that smell somewhat sticky and over ripe.
About an hour in, the fragrance smooths out and I get that coconutty vanilla smell but even more predominantly, the sandalwood which is generally nice but sometimes gives me whiffs of something a tiny bit fusty or unclean.
On the whole though this is a soft, gentle and pleasing fragrance.
I don't think however that I like it enough to consider upgrading my mini to a full bottle - that is, unless my opinion changes drastically with further wear.",03/22/23 06:38,cookygirl
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"It's one of my sweetest and the most intriguing fragrances at the same time.
Although I don't like vanilla perfume this one is special. It's more like dates/honey/coconut vibe with a decent amount of incense in it. Love!
This fragrance has a holiday vibe, the name ""Nomade"" suits it. It feels like being in an oasis somwhere on the desert. There are palm trees, dates, but on the skin you can also feel the earthy smell of adventure and ""everything that can happen on the journey into unknown"".
Don't hesitate to try, even if you're not a fan of a Chloe brand and sweetnes in parfumes.",03/22/23 03:53,ankaa
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Very nice addition to my collection. I've hesitated for an year to blind buy it but i finally did.I smelled the intense version and I found it weigh too sweet but this one is fresher, more uplifting and more airy. Lovely!

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This is absolutely divine! This is a special fragrance. It’s an original among my collection, although I can get hints and whiffs of bubblegum sweetness much like BDK rouge smoking. Not sure which notes are bringing about the similarities. This is a top 10 for life.",03/15/23 15:56,brenda.arellano001
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"THIS SMELLS DIVINE! I blind bought a 75ml bottle after hearing that it smells like a niche perfume.

Love the bottle, first of all. The juice, tbh, at first I wasn't too crazy about. It smells very similar to those scented crayons we used to have when we were children. If you're in your late 20s, 30s, you'll know what I'm referring to. After using it for a couple weeks, yes, it still smells like scented crayons, BUT in the best way possible.

The fragrance smells warm and sweet and very floral. It is youthful, but not juvenile in the slightest. I cannot smell any fruitiness others were talking about, to me, it's straight up heavily floral, sweet, smooth and feminine but not at all fruity. It smells really natural, in a way doesn't smell like a perfume but some kind of extract from flowers. It doesn't smell like anything I have ever smelled before (but the crayons I swear) and I love that for me. But absolutely not a safe blind buy. I feel like people will either really love it, or really hate it. It doesn't smell like a designer perfume. I guess I love it simply for its uniqueness. Like, if people know this scent, they can tell that you're wearing it right away. It has the potential to be someone's signature scent.

Now, the downside. This perfume is pretty much linear, meaning it doesn't have layers. To my nose, all layers smell very similar. You can still tell there are some differences, but defo not clear. The date and jasmine notes are very prominent, and they are there throughout the whole experience. If you want your perfume to have many distinctive notes, this one isn't for you. But sometimes I want a perfume that just simply smells like one note throughout, and this one is that.

Despite being linear, this perfume is far from being boring, as the scent is interesting enough to enjoy the whole day. Oh yes, it lasts the whole day. You will need to spray a little more heavily compared to other designer EDPs though. But it's stronger than the usual EDTs. I spray around 10 times whenever I use it, which is the same with how I usually spray my EDTs. It projects but nothing too crazy, which I love. It can be a bit coying if you overspray and are in a small space since the scent is warm, but I don't find it heady or sneeze inducing like most other designer perfumes. Defo a scent for daytime, in spring or summer.

I usually love perfumes for how they make me feel. This one makes me feel like the prettiest, most unobtainable person in the room. It is office-friendly, again, if the office isn't too small and packed. It is a good date night scent as well I feel like, although I wouldn't personally wear it on dates because as I said, it smells like someone who's pretty and elegant, but so expensive she's unobtainable. Imagine a princess.

Overall solid 8.5/10. Worth the try and honestly, if you collect perfumes, this is worth blind buying as you probably haven't had anything like it in your collection.",03/07/23 02:35,jbaby283
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Deep vanilla with dates and a hint of fruitiness plus a tinge of green notes but to my nose has a coconut type of whiff as well which it does not have in its blend.
It's very soft and very wearable but it seems to be a fragrance that should have stood alone and not put with the Nomade line. It has reasonable staying power about 6 hours and is very pretty for day wear mostly. It isn't majestic enough to hold a place as a night wear fragrance.",02/25/23 00:21,LadyMuck
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I tested this on paper at the store, and also got a freebie sample. On paper it's quite strong, the jasmine is very prominent. On my skin, it opens up very jasmine-y but it's a sweet, vanillic jasmine which then kind of blends into a cozy, comforting, sweet, but not cloying scent. I do get a bit of a beachy vibe, but to me it's more of a ""summer afternoon when the breeze carries the smell of the blooming flowers and you're dozing off at the porch"" type of scent.

Unfortunately, even though I still smell a faint vanilla on my wrist after 10 hours if I bury my nose in it, the sillage is pretty intimate and I only get whiffs of it the first couple or hours.",02/13/23 12:23,Ardenia
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"A slightly sour and sweeter take on the original Nomade. I really like the OG and I like this one as well.

This one smells brighter than the OG and it doesn't have this light masculine vibe that the original OG has. It still has that elegant quality imo. You also get that vegetal touch that's so characteristic to the OG, but it feels less prominent in Naturelle.

On my skin, I don't get much vanilla. Tbh, the scent's longevity is not as good as the OG Nomade, which lasts quite a long time.

Might be better on hot days, I fee like this is too underwhelming for winter.",02/01/23 12:04,ChocoLei
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Had high hopes on this based on what I had read. At first spray I was like...wait a minute. I liked it, but didn't love it. I was a bit underwhelmed.

Then, I tried it out again a few weeks later and oh my god. I get it now. I am so in love! It is unique in the best way possible. The woody notes mixed with the ultra-feminine sweetness reminds me of some kind of forest goddess.

On my skin it actually has very good lasting power. The sillage is ok.",01/24/23 12:04,sundayinheaven

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Oh what an exquisite natural-origins fragrance! Like a soft sigh of jasmine and ylang-ylang combined with other soft florals and a tropical feel, this is gentle femininity and innocence in a solar semi-transparent scent that lingers like a lover's kiss on your skin. For when you enjoy soft scents, without any artificial feeling whatsoever, this fragrance, unlike the other Nomades, perfectly matches the mood of an early summer morning in the park. Wear with pleasure to work, to play, and to sleep: it's comforting, refreshing and is unlikely to bother anyone if sprayed lightly, even if you work as a nurse.",01/13/23 19:54,Arwen77
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Do you love to smell amazing in a definitively feminine way- soft, vanillic, sweet but not cloyingly so? Yes? This is the perfume for you. Do you want to smell distinct from people in your surroundings? Yes? This is the perfume for you. Do you already have other Chloe Nomade flankers and are wondering if this is different enough to buy? Yes, it is. My take? Given that there’s only so many hours in the day to wear a fragrance and there are sooooo many beautiful perfumes out there, this gem is worth a spot in your life.",01/11/23 08:39,Likilichi
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Lovely warm vanilla and dried fruits with a dash of wood. This is distinctly different from the other Nomades. Chloe Nomade EDP Naturelle is not a chypre but instead a sweet floral Oriental. I like the other Nomades but I also like this which is much more causal and easy going. I don't detect oakmoss here, only some mild woods.

I wouldn't say I smell dates not being exactly sure of the smell of dates. On me the initial fruity quality strikes me as apricots or even prunes (dried plums). Once it dries down it's heavily vanillic. I don't really get the tropical, suntan lotion vibes others are getting but maybe I'm still recovering from COVID.

I think this is a cozy and joyous scent. Very warm, very sweet and very vanillic. Longevity and sillage seem moderate. I think any age can wear this, it's not overly teenager sweet. Overall it isn't unusual; it's pretty basic and mainstream, but it's well done and actually smells a bit more natural as opposed to synthetic (yes, I know everything is actually synthetic, but sometimes things smell more realistic/natural). This is a blind buy I'm not mad about! I like it a lot.",01/06/23 16:17,perfumesniffer
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"It’s a good scent, powerful with a good projection and longevity. It smells sweet dates, and to me it’s a bit headache inducing.

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,The date and vanilla combo is smoothly blended in a way that creates the illusion of smelling a tiare pudding.

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"trying a sample of this i received complimentary with another purchase. super fruity, sugary, and sweet. it’s nice and what i think of as traditionally “girly” but kind of undescript. i also think this iteration of dates is throwing me off a bit. i will say it’s better at the dry down (once some of the sugar fades/tones down). overall, pretty, but not my jam.",01/01/23 17:18,raqketa

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Wow. I am impressed.
I loved the original Nomade, but I could detect chemicals in it that deterred me from wanting it.
This one however is the perfect Nomade.
Feminine, pleasant, joy-inducing.
I loved my sample so much that on my to-buy it goes.
Thanks for this change Chloe.",12/29/22 04:22,MademoiselleMaya
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Sampled this in store. To me it smelled like dried dates/figs with a vanilla base.
Its dense and sweet. Even a bit musky. The drydown smells a bit like a mans cologne.

I would describe this as a warm dense date/fig fragrance. I don't think this is a good summer scent nor so good for office.",12/16/22 17:18,Zombie Apocalypse

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"From all of the Nomades, this one is my favorite. Perfect combination of sweet, woody, and just something out of the ordinary. Stands out among all the other modern scents. Strong and long lasting. Definitely worth the money!",12/07/22 15:23,sugaryrose
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Really unique scent, fruity but fresh, powdery hut not boring!I regret I didn’t buy it a duty free when I got a chance :( the prices online are more expensive, but I am hopeful I will get it later🙆🏻♀️",11/28/22 22:42,malikun
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Purely from the description of the fragrance, ""Nomade Naturelle"" sounds like a fragrance that I should like.Date and vanilla is amazing combo.The emphasis here is on ""should"".
Sweet, fruity, sour and it is accompanied by a vanilla sweetness. It's sweeter than you might expect - candied. It's also fairly linear, getting slightly creamy after an hour but never changing too much.The fruity and sour note remains throughout the fragrance.",11/09/22 11:43,Ominni
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Don't blind buy it! I am glad I've ordered a sample first, it's a sweet, creamy scent, got this beachy vibe, just a bit sickly though, completely different to the other Nomade flankers. It's a no from me...",11/03/22 12:43,igalmusic
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,My grandmother would like it for sure. It's the kind of fragrance she used to wear. And I know why I don't like it so much: Vanilla. Strong Vanilla 😑,10/28/22 08:51,Twentzel
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"When I first tried this I loved it. Its unusual and opens with a sour citrus bergamot mixed with sugary dates. The jasmine and sandlewood combo with vanilla is gorgeous and really addictive. However, on my skin it quickly becomes a skin scent and the dry down is a bit dull. I wish the opening lasted longer. I'll give this another go in the summer and see how it performs then 👍",10/28/22 04:45,Dodiefy
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"An absolute pass for me. It's almost gourmand with some flower notes, it smells like cake (i am not a fan of vanilla, especially when it's that prominent). I understand shy someone would like this however, it's warm and sophisticated.
I sprayed before leaving for work in the morning it almost gave me a headache (sweet perfumes can do that to me) but it smoothed out after 30 min.
I get vanilla, dates and a liiittle bit of jasmin. I would love to smell this combined with some leathery notes.

If it was a girl, she would have long hair, lots of brown items in her closet, a love for 90s fashion and music. Coffee addict, definitely the leader of her friend group loves Saturday morning walks in the city, where she gets to showcase her sunglasses collection.",10/25/22 01:19,Frantheone
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Predominant note is Egyptian Jasmine, Im surprised that people have voted dates as the predominant note. Anyway, I love it, super orgasmic. Makes me smile all day. A great sweety scent that actually projects beautifully in a hot climate. Its like Narciso Ambree but sweeter, projects stronger and lasts longer.",10/20/22 12:04,Fleurdecoco

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I'm not fond of the original version, and find this rendition glorious. A little bit like Bronze Goddess that I also enjoy, and very faraway from the og. I'd call it a monoi scent.",10/06/22 19:36,xxgetaway
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Really disappointed, I really like the original edt and edp but this has no connection to those at all. Horribly sweet with a vaguely sour undercurrent, I want to wash it off :(",09/28/22 09:08,LMD
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I am so in love with this unusual scent! Initially, I was very indifferent, but was rebounding with this fragrance. I started wearing it in September, it is such a lovely cosy scent for early Autumn!

It is powdery, sweet from the dates, the plum is not sour. I do not detect any vanilla. It does remind me of Bronze Goddess - it must be the creaminess of sandalwood. Overall it is soft, smooth and well rounded. An exceptional scent for a designer perfume.

I'll keep on wearing it before I can smell it on everyone!",09/14/22 09:34,ladyofwinter
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I was quite surprised that I liked it because I'm not into sweet perfumes. So, this is a sweet perfume, the sweetness coming mostly from the dates but it's not sticky sweet. After half an hour or an hour the perfume gets creamy, Jasmine starts to show and after a while it becomes a very nice and creamy sandalwood perfume. I think it's quite original, the quality is very good and it is a very likeable perfume the projection is moderate. I wouldn't say that it's very close to other nomade perfumes, for me the only connection is the mirabelle and maybe some moss. I have read somewhere that it smells like a expensive sunscreen I could related although it does have more depth and interesting facets. I recommend!",09/13/22 03:28,DeanaDe
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This perfume should have had its own name.

(FOR ME:) Mirabelle (yellow plum) is a sour plum; Freesia is a white flower that is fresh and has some citrusy notes. These two blend well with citruses and aquatic notes in Nomade eau de toilette. Nomade Naturelle is a different kind of Nomade.

This one does not have this sour-citrus-fresh vibe. It's a yummy gourmand perfume with a lot of sweetness from A to Z. This sweetness can be tricky though and it had many nuances within 2 hours just on my skin:
- dates,
- coconut (very distant, but not like sunscreen for me),
- sugared dried papaya
- sugared dried purple plums (naturally very sweet plums vs sour mirabelle)
- sugared chestnuts towards the dry down.

Chestnuts, Sandalwood and Vanilla sound like a simplified version of Noir Exquis. Overall, great value for the price!",08/29/22 07:57,Dina France
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"To me this it's the fall/vinter version of Nomade.
The Nomade Naturelle is not similar to the original Nomade, this is sweet, cosy, warm and not as earthy as the OG.
I get a warm, sweet and spicy vanilla with dates and i really enjoy it.
Can't wait to put on a big cozy cardigan, doze myself in this and snuggle down to a movie when the weather turns colder.",08/18/22 22:39,LuckyMommy
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Not mass appealing at all, and that’s why I love it. It’s special.
I imagine this would be the scent of an oasis in the desert.
When o first try it on the store it last all day long, after I got the bottle I don’t feel the same lasting power, but that’s maybe because my nose got familiar.",08/08/22 14:12,Sonia_
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"To be honest, I'm not big fan of this new version of Nomade. To me, this frangrance smells more like a luxury sunscreen - so I can imagine pulling it off on holiday, somewhere by sea, but not on other occassions. It's not bad, but nothing breathtaking or memorable. It's definitely more sweeter than the original EdP, so I'm sure that plenty of people will like Naturelle more over other releases from this line. And good for them. :)",08/04/22 07:47,Christine_Starling
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"My experience with this fragrance (tried twice) is very different for the ones mentoined in the other reviews. skin chemestry tricks, I assume . As far as I like Nomade absolou with its cyphre ispired dark earthness, this one is a big no for me. I am able to smell only the sweet - too much sweet - fruity in the opening. Stop. I grow tired and slightly sickened after the first istants and the fragrance didn't evolve at all after this.",07/30/22 06:19,Franci90
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This is adorable. It smells fun and carefree and has that ""last days of Summer"" vibe. The date note is sweet yet soft.

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"The opening is a bit too sweet and too synthetic for me. But that quickly disappears and a very warm sweet vanilla with dates notes start to develop. It’s a really cozy scent, with a hint of jasmine and spices. I would wear it during the autumn 😍",07/09/22 22:46,eva.daisy.88
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Beautiful, although very unexpected. I have expected a similar scent to the OG, but lighter, something closer to the EDT, but this is totally different. It could be branded as its own separate perfume.

Very summery, ""solar"" type of a fragrance. It starts very yummy, sweet and fruity, and dries down into intoxicating, warm florals. Without reading the notes, I would have bet that it has ylang-ylang in the heart, but the warmness must come from the sandalwood. I don't smell the oakmoss. It's very tropical, an amazing choice for summer.",07/06/22 02:45,missogi
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I tried so hard to love this one because I'm huge OG nomade fan and I adore dates but this is definitely my least favourite of the line. I gave it a proper time to reveal its self as usually I end up loving most of my blind buys but it has been months and the more I wear it the less I like it, the opening is too sharp and synthetic for a natural fragrance and the dry down although quite nice but boring and generic. It has a moderate lasting power and weak sillage and I have never received a single compliment on it. Blind buy fail.

Edit: maceration magic happened again, I don't get anymore the harsh synthetic opening, the scent is much smoother and addictive although I get mainly jasmine and not at all date (at least not the one cultivated in my country) and the dry down is really lovely, summer holidays in bottle. I like it a lot.",07/05/22 07:12,Lamiawitipo
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This is so stunning!! I blind bought this as I knew I would love it, I currently use the absolute version and love the earthy sweetness but I love this one even more it's been what I was looking for many years. I mature grown up earthy semi sweet creamy warmed up sunlotion skin but without coconut, smells like the hot air in the dessert/ abroad walking through the streets, hot tarmac and the beach sand blowing in the air it's simply gorgeous!! Have just bought a 75ml and hope they never discontinue! The lasting power is around 4/5 hour mark longer on clothes it's beautiful lovely date and vanilla earthy notes it's not overly girly which I love please no one else get this I need it for myself 🤣😁",07/03/22 21:41,Lipsticklights
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This is actually kinda gross? Smells like burning woods in the opening. I'm guessing that is the sandalwood. It comes across very smoky. The dry down is slightly more tolerable as the sweetness of the vanilla and florals push through. It is long-lasting (5+ hrs), albeit with poor projection. Alas, back to the store this goes. Do not blind buy!",06/26/22 16:49,grandeur
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"-I can't tell what Naturelle aspires to be. It's one messy blend with no direction.

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Absolutely amazing, and just about the only perfume with sandalwood, I can stand nowadays, simply because I can't smell that particular note in there. Thank God 😁 Gorgeous!, feminine, alluring jasmine, juicy mirabelle, siruppy dates, smooth, warm, sensual vanilla and a touch of oakmoss to add some depth and uniqueness to this beauty. I simply can't get enough of this scent. It makes me feel so good wearing this. I have to reapply a couple of times during the day, but I'll do that without complaining because from top to base, this is an absolute joy. A new favorite 💕",06/19/22 12:23,Mariamaija Amélie
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This is addictive!! I especially love the sweet woody aspect, it's truly intoxicating and it makes me want to sniff my wrist every 5 seconds 😆. I have never cared for the original but this one and the absolu are amazing❣

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Love it, and love the date note. It's a comforting summery smell, something between a summer tiaré and a woody oriental.
It reminds me of the smell of the Mamounia Marrakech, it's a signature home scent that you can buy when visiting (I use it as a bedroom scent). They have in common one ingredient: the date.",06/08/22 07:49,Insolente
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I adore Nomade Naturelle.
That sweet nuance, unexpected from a Nomade, is the detail that I like the most.
Seemingly elusive. Instead it may surprise you when at the end of the day you find its trace for a quick sniff on your wrist. It is still there, warm and comforting.
This creation makes me dream of a thousand and one nights of muffled opulence, the tinkling sparkle of warm breeze caressing the face.
Subtle, tactile and soft elegance. Infinite sophisticated sweetness, like the unique and unmistakable flavor of the first warm summer evenings, as the sun goes down.
Gorgeous.",06/04/22 12:17,masako_30
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Dear @Daebrack, it’s my thought that everyone, each of us deserves to wear any perfume. It is a pure heart that makes every earthly difference, and this makes a person deserving to wear the most sublime of essences.
So indulge yourself with this treat you desire and that you certainly earned, if you love its aroma, awesome and from the Arabian Nights.",06/04/22 05:48,masako_30
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This fragrance is the feeling of luxury in a bottle. It smells like the rich ladies in the chique boutiques you go to when you need a fancy dress for occasions like prom or a wedding. Those stores where the salesladies are honest and genuinely helpful, and costumers seem to have their shit together. I feel like I don't deserve to wear this one yet, like I need to earn it.",06/04/22 05:38,Daebrack
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This may not be a very valuable review, but I figure when there is something new on the market, any comment might be useful at that point. I am also not very familiar with the rest of Nomade range. I have tested the first from the range, was left completely indifferent and never returned to it by now. I admit, I was now intrigued by the ""natural ingredients"" and decided to test it on my wrist and spend a day with it.
So once again I don't care very much for the scent, there is something sweet and woody like a coconut or a fig (tree), that I should have liked more. I wouldn't invest in it for the very fragrance, but I am honestly amazed how long it stayed with me yesterday. I left my home in the morning with my ""Croisiere"" J'adore, In Joy, which felt like a perfect pick for the hot day at the seaside. Only it has left my side completely by the time I visited the perfume shop where I tested this Nomade (some 3h later). However, Nomade stayed with me by the rest of the day and afternoon, and I certainly have not expected it from Naturelle, the fragrance marketed and named for the high rate of natural raw material. It doesn't even smell particularly natural to me, it has a certain car freshener type of choking sweetness. I actually prefer D&G Light Blue Sun, the limited edition from the popular line, which has a distinctive coconut-sweet, subdued beach vibe. I kind of put these kind of fragrances in the same box, but admittedly Nomade Naturelle beats it in terms of longevity by far. Maybe if I haven't had already the Light Blue Sun and Guerlain's Limon Verde, I would have considered N. Naturelle.
I'm gonna pass it though, but I highly recommend it just for the sake of its resilient presence, even in hot climates. I should point out that it stays close to the skin, but stubbornly so.",06/01/22 02:24,Nomen
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Without reading any reviews or notes my impression was sweet creamy intoxicating jasmine, vanilla and coconut. Like a very high end sun product that smells familiar yet not mainstream. I see I am not the only one. Absolutely addictive and performs well on me. Very far from the other Nomades, this is not a Chypre but a floral gourmand. I’m surprised dates and mirabelle are listed, did not get mirabelle like in the others.

Love at first sniff because of the quality and scent and definitely high on my wishlist!",05/28/22 14:24,Scentedalterego
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Intoxicating.
Addictive.
Do not buy this, you may be enchanted by its sorcery. You may spray just for that next fix. That high becomes all you can think about. If you want to be high then yes go ahead sniff at your own peril.
But, Seriously this is something else.
A Unique potion 🧪
It makes me nostalgic for something and takes me to a time and place I can’t remember.
It reminds of something so potently, but what?
It does that something to me.
This is bewitching stuff.
I think I’m in love.",05/21/22 05:21,Rainstorm

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"To be honest I am not huge fan of original Chloe Nomade, but when I received sample of the Naturelle I couldn’t stop smelling my wrists. Their is something so addicting to this fragrance, I knew I needed a bottle. The Jasmine is so creamy with soft sandalwood. I can’t detect specific note of dates but the whole fragrance is very well put together. It dries down to a soft, pretty, addicting, woody vanilla while that Jasmine note still lingering on the skin giving that sun warmed up lotion leathered skin but better. After some hours on my skin, the vanilla was pulling the most and reminded me a lot of Van Cleef & Arpels Orchidee Vanille but only at deepdry down.
If you were not into original Chloe Nomade, please don’t pass on this one, give it a try.",05/17/22 11:13,Kots_Tanya
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Love at first sniff a month ago. Now the weather is beginning to be warmer here in The Netherlands, I find it to be to full/powdery.

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,I don’t like any of the other Nomades. It leans too masculine for my taste. This could easily pass as Unisex in my opinion. Smells somewhat similar to Replica Whispers in the Library if you concentrate on the vanilla and woody notes. I like it. Add to wish list.,05/14/22 04:59,Marisa36
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Bought it 30 seconds after I sniffed it for the first time. It's been a few continuous days of wearing it now, and my opinion hasn't changed. It's a lovely, warm, and kind of outdoorsy adventurous scent. I smell a lot of honey, some wide open air, and that teensiest hint of a woodworker in his atelier who has long hair and his shirt off lol. It's that heavenly slightly sporty, slightly woodsy scent that is just amazing. It makes me want to jump on a horse and gallop away across a beach with my hair flowing dramatically in the wind. The sillage is great, and longevity is surprisingly good, especially for a Chloé fragrance. Strong contender to become one of my favourites.",05/06/22 06:18,Jefferson_starkid
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This is absolutely gorgeous - the date makes it special and gives a warm, cozy vibe. But since it is a natural fragrance, it does go down to a skin scent after about 2 hours. But it is good enough that I don’t mind reapplying. A total love.",05/03/22 07:58,Beauxpeep
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I am a huge Nomade fan but I have to admit that this release let me down.

The scent is not bad in any way. It felt like a very nice tropical floral for summer but there are so many better picks for this category out there. The lasting power on my skin was also less than 2 hours which for this price is just not worth it. It lacks the oomph and uniqueness the original has.",04/29/22 11:13,drawingmaniac35
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I love this on paper, when I smelled it I was sure this was a good candidate for being my signature scent. Unfortunately, the lovely scent just disappears on my skin in less than 1h. I had to really sniff my nose to my arm in other to smell anything, which I would not mind, but the smell left there was not good or similar to the one on paper.
I'm not sure if I have to overspray this one, I'll test one more time next time I go to the store.",04/26/22 08:11,mbalbertini
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I went to the Chloe stall to finally get my hands on the Vanilla Planifolia from their collab with Atelier des Fleurs and the lady at the counter gave me a sample of this. All I can say is, I love my perfumes but I have never in my life been so awestruck by a perfume like I did with this. It was love at first smell.

After purchasing this, I sprayed it on myself and actually teared up! I was so emotional. Even my sister can’t stop smelling it. She calls it a “kind scent.”

I saw a comment on here that said they got banana from the first opening and I totally agree! Though my initial impression was of mango.

The only thing though is that I don’t think it lasts very long :( It probably has to do with the fact that it is a *natural* perfume. It does last longer on clothing but disappears within an hour on the skin. The sillage is incredible for about an hour, and it’s definitely a smell that makes itself very present even with masks on (I’m from Hong Kong and we still all have to wear masks 24/7)

Edit: This scent completely transforms in humid weather. It smells so strongly of bourbon, which is a scent I'm very fond of!!",04/22/22 06:48,Myfanwy

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I really like the mirabelle note in this and it smells sweet, playful and approachable. I think the date is an interesting touch as well. I can smell some floral, but to me it smells more fruity than floral. There is also something that feels slightly powdery but in a good way, I'm not sure what it is but I like it. It's a more unique scent out of the ones by Chloe that I smelled. I like this more than the original Nomade. The original smelled a bit sour in comparison.",03/29/22 12:23,wenshere

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,Got a sample of this a couple of days ago. The best way to describe it is as warm and cosy but at the same time I get this sunlotion and tropical summer in Spain vibe. It's sweet and you definitely get the date and vanilla but it almost smell like coconut after a while. I absolutely love this as it reminds me of walking through the streets of Malaga Spain while wearing sunlotion and smelling the sweetness from all the nougat shops! I think this will be a good fragrance for winter (cozy) and summer!,03/27/22 16:58,Nisbaxter
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Yes its different from the other perfumes in the nomade line, but it still suits the theme. If I imagine mulan wearing the other nomades this would be a perfume for Jasmine in Aladdin. Compared to nomade absolu this one is definitely warmer, sweeter and more feminine on my skin. Would be a beautiful spring/summer wedding perfume. On me I get jasmine sweetened with a touch of sun warm fresh dates!

Except from Jasmine in Aladdin I also imagine that Missandei in game of thrones would smell like this.

Edit: now after standing on my shelf for a while this smells quite different. Opening is the same - magical and unique sweetness of the dates and jasmine. However after that it dries down quite woody quickly! I like woody perfumes so really don’t mind but I believe that’s the reason people find it quite unisex",03/24/22 11:08,Emli94
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I think this perfume is absolutely beautiful. It would work just as well on men as on women. It's sexy!! I imagine people with tanned skin and dark hair when I smell this. It's natural smelling with good sillage and longevity. It's sweet, warm, kind of ""tropical"" and powdery. It's like a summery scent without coconut or tiare. Amazing.",03/21/22 14:23,FrkFors
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This is coming across masculine because of the spicy aspect. It's also minty and I don't know why. Is it the sandalwood or jasmine?

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Oh, my, second time testing this today in Sephora and definitely made it to the top of my wishlist!

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Holy vaches au pâturages naturelles! This hit online discounters quickly! I smelled it and liked it a month ago when it first hit the shelves, but reasoned I might pop for it when the price comes down. Well today the 75ml popped up in Europe for a song. Well, still 70 bucks but not 140! Swiss High Street pricing! I don't think it's worth 70, but I like it!

It reminds me of Colonia Futura Acqua di Parma which is also natural molecules. Doesn't smell the same, but it's obviously ""natural"" smelling, cheerful and energetic. That also means they both somewhat remind me of homemade hippy dippy good smelling bug spray or room spray. This is gritty and not ""French style"" perfumery, alas. I think the Italians do this a bit better. The only thing not to like is the price, as this would be a delight at 15 bucks in a brown glass apothecary bottle.

Nose Caroline Dumur did Pure XS Night which is a gorgeous fragrance though I don't wear it simply because I have too many already.

1) I would like some mainstream upscale house to do a ""naturelle"" with non IFRA molecules and some real oomph, though I realise it's only a pipe dream, now.

2) It somewhat irks me that upscale and luxury products are wading into ""natural"" perfumery commodities, yet I can't buy a 20 buck barbershop or fougere that is 100% natural. Am I the only one? I'm thankful for Chloe's gesture, nevertheless. Sorry not sorry, I expect to smell this in Saint-Tropez and other watering holes filled with riche bobos.

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"As mentioned below, I get the same “suede“ note as I get from Narciso Rodriguez Musc Noir. Its only in the very dry down I get this comparison - but the perfume lasts for an eternity so you'll get that same suede vibe for quite some time. I much prefer this to Soleil Blanc cause I smell something screechy in SB. This one is like summery, but not beach kinda.. it's more like the sun and the sand in the desert. The campaign for the original nomade suit this version much better than the original, which is much more oak mossy, while this one is so natural sweet (not sugary, sweet from the dates and mirabelle plum). I really love this one, it's so worth a visit! Just keep in mind that this one does not smell like the rest of the line, it's something summery and new. It would still use it in spring and fall though, that's just how lovely it smells.",03/03/22 06:31,Perfumepusher
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I really don’t get any of the above comparisons with Chloe naturelle.. It’s not even close to Terracotta, Soleil Blanc or Monoi!

I do get a suede note which is not listed but it’s the same as in Musc noir. It also has this sparkly opening as MN but Chloe has this grainy feel together with the sparkly opening. After the sparkly opening the notes mingel together and it becomes quite linear from that point on.

It’s a nice fragrance but they should have brought it out as a new stand alone fragrance and not flanker Imo.",03/02/22 13:08,J_love_Gardenia
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This is very different from the other Nomades. I don't understand why brands create a flanker when it has nothing in common with the original...(I guess the answer is to save cost and capitalize on something that works well - still, not really satisfying for the customer)
The smell: the date accord is strong in the opening, then the florals take over. I dont get a distinctive floral note as it is well blended. Overall it gives an exotic, even tropical vibe bordering beachy. Definitely not what I have expected.",02/28/22 03:57,karinatfragrantica
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I tried this and on my skin and I quite liked it. This is a very powdery and sweet scent on me, also it's quite different from the original Nomade . As far as performance goes this is great 8+ hours, with moderate sillage for about 5 hours. This is a nice perfume if you enjoy sweet powdery scents",02/25/22 13:21,emma.maria36
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I agree with SailorV. First of all, Nomade Naturelle doesn't smell anything like other Nomades. I sense a creamy, coconutty natural jasmine and some sweetness or a bubblegummy tuberose. Reminds me of Mancera Velvet Vanilla, Guerlain Terracotta, Yves Rocher Monoi. And it's Nomade Naturelle I like the most. Sometimes white flowers have that indolic note which I can't stand. Luckily, It's not present here. It's also quite fresh and a little bit airy. Now in the Winter Nomade Naturelle is great and I think in the Summer it's going to be even better.",02/23/22 12:21,Charlize
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"This has nothing in common with the other Nomades, but I still find it quite fitting for the name and the wanderlust image of this line. This scent reminds me of sun and sands, beaches and exotic flowers.

I don't know how what the requirements to sell a perfume as ""100% natural origin"" are, but I do think this smells like something made with natural oils, blended in a smooth, designer-ish way. The jasmine has an especially oily feel to it, it has a bit of a monoi vibe (even though it doesn't smell like tiare) mixed with bubblegummy white floral sweetness. I definitely get some fruity tones, but as fruit notes can't be extracted naturally, I think this must mostly come from the jasmine. Chloe calls it a ""date accord"" on their website, so they don't pretend they used some precious essence extracted directly from dates. I can also clearly smell a woodsy note, but I don't find it pronouncedly sandalwoody. That's the dry part of the scent that conjures images of desert sand dunes in my mind.
In the drydown the vanilla really comes out and warms everything up. At this point I understand the user below who just wrote ""cinnamon banana"" as the whole review, it does kind of smell like that... In a perfumey, not-so-edible way though.

All in all this is a nice scent and I might retry it when it's warmer, as I think this is essentially a summery, beachy floral with a warmer vanilla base.",02/23/22 11:55,SailorV

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Nomade Naturelle has nothing in common with Vanilla Fields or Orchid Soleil. It is sweet and fruity by combining notes of dates and mirabelles, but not gourmand. Basically, the sandalwood feels very good in the dry down, so the perfume becomes a woody fruit fragrance with a hint of vanilla and oakmoss. The name seems well chosen and suitable for the perfume and what it represents. Flower power, boho style ...
Its a fragrance of free spirits, close to nature.",02/19/22 07:32,VeroMikaela

Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"Just tested it in a shop today. It's cold here in Europe and the scent is cozy and warm. I can smell some milky/creamy notes together with dates which is pretty nice. I have both edp & edt and this one smells different. It's kind of similar somehow but not a flanker in my opinion. Fruity notes come first, then white flowers with sweet undertones as the fragrance evolves. Vanilla is like a soft cloud, the silage is pretty decent, projection good and I had just 2 sprays. I have a tester so will give it a proper day long test to see if it's worth a full bottle. For now it's a strong like leaning to love 😊
Edit: it's a love, just bought 75 ml bottle 😊",02/04/22 14:38,LudkaK
Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum Chloé,"I like the previous Nomades (edt, edp, absolue) but somehow they don’t smell pleasant on me. Maybe the oakmoss?
Anyway, I tried the new Nomade naturelle in store today. And wow, this is a surprise! It smells nothing like its predecessors. Why they called it Nomade is a mystery to me. It’s quite sweet and tropical, like creamy coconut? Very girlie at the start. After 2 hours a faint woody accord comes through, making it more interesting. But it stays sweet and tropical.

The watermelon opening is impressing. It is sappy and with sparkling tangerine a perfect introduction for the roses.
Chloé presents everything we love about roses: elegant, feminine, graceful.
Fresia and iris are very soft: makes the roses the main start, just chime in.

It is truely adorable. Airy, young, classy.
No doubt Chloé is admirable.",12/16/22 02:16,Shui-Xian

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Chloe EDT was my favourite scent in the early twenties. I own both the EDT and EDP, but I much prefer the EDT because it's lighter, fresher and younger. I agree with earlier reviews that it is a very clean scent. Unfortunately now that I'm in my late twenties, I'm slowly growing out of my Chloe phase. It's still a lovely perfume, but too innocent and girlish for my liking.",10/01/21 20:40,kaylietam

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This Chloe EDT feels like it's a little bit more on the mature side than the Chloe EDP. Sandalwood mixed with tonka gives Chloe EDT its dusty musky feeling. A hint of watermelon and pink pepper create a lightness in the opening. Then freesia, rose and iris blend into a rich powder sweetened by mandarin. Overall, Chloe EDT is beautiful, lasts longer than the EDP on my skin, and is perfect for daytime office wear. It's a clean, light scent that wafts around you off and on during the day. Feminine, projects about 12 inches, and lasts on my skin for 6 hours easily. Great gift for any woman of any age.",04/01/21 07:42,joliecat
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I really like this version. It's very fresh, floral, and clean. Less powdery than the EDP. It also lasts quite long for an EDT. I also have the EDP and Absolu version which I also love. I find this perfect for hot days as it's got a very refreshing clean scent -- definitely something that's right outta the shower kind of fresh. It doesn't smell soapy to me, not like detergent like how some are saying.

I also find that it's a perfect everyday scent. It's inoffensive. I use this when I get ""tired"" from my stronger scented perfumes.

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I loved this in my 20s, when it first came out there wasn't anything like it. Chloe is with a very sharp and clean note in the middle of a soft dreamy innocence hum of florals. The cleanness is especially pronounced at the beginning and it's almost cutting through like a blaze.
It smells fresh and youthful, a bit like a flower that is about to bloom, or a bud of it. I think this scent is for younger women, maybe for somebody who is freshly starting her career, and I wouldn't be interested in wearing this anymore. But it is such a lovely and innocent scent.",04/26/20 10:09,curieuse
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Well, i must have the aprox 2008 version. Whte box, pink beige Chloe font.
Crystal like clean antique feeling comes to mind. A scent almost of days gone by. Slightly adelydic throughout. And although it is... that watery juicy fruit sweet note shines through, but not in the now traditional fruity perfumed way. You would, in fact, not pick it perhaps at all.
Definitely a soapy persistence with a soapy clean rose that shines softly, hidden like.
Sweet '- not gourmand. Chivalrous, perhaps? Almost of the days when it would bring a man to his knees type perfume.",09/20/19 23:10,delightme5
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I got it at an old perfume bunch sale. Was not really interested in this particular one, but eventually found it very nice. It is light white floral citrus. Non offensive at all. Classy. Not fruitchully. Very lady like day scent. I normally like character fragrances, but this one is like a expensive thin silk scarf. It is one good to have when you don't want to think which fragrance to wear. Reliable day duty fragrance.",09/02/19 22:43,tandem_4x4
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Opens with sharp alcohol and rose notes, then dries down to headache inducing floral notes. The alcohol note remains throughout the life of this fragrance, which is fairly long. Sillage is less than average.
I suppose C edt could pass for a fresh fragrance, but there is a strange fuzzy quality about the scent. Maybe it's the iris or the tonka bean, notes I tend to have a hard time liking. There's no fruit in C edt, as far as I can tell. There is a good bit of sandalwood, however it's a shortlived note, well gone while the rose continues.
C. is an office safe feminine fragrance for those who like modern florals.",03/29/19 11:43,Phantomias
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I have been collecting perfumes that I think I will like (based on notes and reviews) since I quit smoking a year ago. I now have collected hundreds of beautiful fragrances. Way too much, but I want lots of options, and have a wide-ranging taste in fragrances.

Out of all of the perfumes I have purchased, many niche and other expensive frags that are beautiful, Chloe remains my all-time favorite and signature scent.

I am not good at describing notes yet, but I know I like a soapy rose for sure. Both this one and the EDP, probably leaning towards the EDT, is the best thing I have ever smelled in my life. That's saying a lot since I am almost 49!

I am told I have young taste in perfumes for my age, but that is because I feel 20. It seems like I was 20 just yesterday and woke up today 48 years old!

This is so awesome that it literally makes my mouth water as soon as I apply. The EDT is especially fresh and vibrant. This really agrees with my skin I guess. Sadly (for my husband) he tells me it smells like something his grandmother would wear. Even that has not changed my mind. I cannot begin to tell you how GREAT this scent makes me feel. CHloe EDP and EDT are the first two purchases I made when I quit smoking, and a year later, still the best ever. I even bought a couple of back ups (just in case).

I know that everyone that ends up with a perfume addiction of sorts, buys for various reasons. My reason is because of the way a scent has the power to change your day, at least change your mood or outlook. Even wakes me up when I am having a hard morning getting ready for work. I cannot believe I wasted all those years smoking. I didn't really wear perfume while I smoked bc that would be useless. Now that I don't leave home without it, and in fact is my favorite part of every day (selecting the frag), I know I will never smoke again!

Perfume in my opinion should be worn based on the way in which the particular scent makes you feel inside. So long as you're not wearing offensive frags to an office or closed environment with people, it is all about you.",02/28/19 19:09,waskotransportation
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This is a nice smelling scent but not for me. It is pleasant and unlikely to offend anyone but its a bit too clean and antiseptic almost reminds me of cleaning products.

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"i got this as a present! It's a hit perfume. Lasts long, smells good, clean and fresh! But i haven't fallen in love with it.

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I LOVE this! It’s fresh/clean/floral. Just beautiful! I’ve had this for maybe 5 or 6 years? Had it hidden away in the back of my closet and felt like I just discovered a new scent when I found it. I sprayed it on my clothes as I was about to walk out the door and was hit by a powerful BO scent. I had just showered not ten minutes before. Changed my shirt, sprayed again and once again BO! It was my beloved Chloe that smelled like BO! I’ve noticed a lot of my fresh scents turn a little off and smell like BO after a few years even when kept in dark, cool spaces. Luckily I sprayed a few times in the air and smelled my beloved Chloe again. May have just been bad perfume from the plastic spray nozzle thing. . I’m gonna be using this a lot this year because I think it’s time to finish the bottle. Just FYI this perfume is long lasting! I will spray and 8-10 hours later will catch a whiff as I move around. The next morning when I get up from bed I can smell Chloe strongly on my body. I just repurchased the new Chloe EDT. Hopefully it’s just as beautiful and long lasting.",08/04/18 18:29,rumari47
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This is a clean smelling scent, maybe too clean. Lily, rose, soap, green. While I don't dislike it it's not my taste. I wish it had a bit more warmth or sweetness. I prefer the original Chloe or Chloe Nomade.",06/28/18 17:45,Sabretoothkitten
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I always thought I owned the eau de parfum, but was recently surprised to see mine labeled as eau de toilette. Although I've had it for a few years, it still has the same scent whenever I wear it. This edt lasts a long time, nearly 12 hours and I can still smell it on me.

I get mostly roses, powder, and something sweet (the tonka bean?). The longer it stays on my skin, the sweeter it gets. Sometimes I find it cloying, but the rose helps to ground the overall scent.

Like to wear this during the day in spring/summer.",06/07/18 22:12,opaquee
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I have had this perfume for about 8+ years, and never realised that it contained rose notes. Looking at the notes I would imagine a more floral scent, but the flowery notes blend together and do not read floral to me. Instead it seems like a juicy sweet pear, but not bountiful, more subdued, like mixing it with laundry drying in the cooler early spring.
It is quite anonymous compared to more mature and sophisticated scents, but is nice to wear when I want to smell feminine but not womanly. It has a girliness and youthfulness that makes it seem more innocent. It can be worn by younger women, but also has a romantic sweeter and more rounded smell that pair well with women who are a bit older than that.
Overall it is like taking summery things like elderflower, wild flowers, pear and a slight hint of older fabric/laundry and putting it in a watery lemonade (no citrus though), then adding some rounded sweetness (from rosehip flower leaves) and depth to it. It is fresh but not zesty, just mild, watery, sweet, softish, rounded, elegant and chic.
I feel like a french girl would wear this on days where she wants to seem more coy, low-key and feminine.",12/20/17 18:52,Parchment

It smells like boob sweat mixed with some random perfume you wore at the beginning of the day with a few crushed rose petals to me...

BUT!

This is an absolute delight. It's refreshing and so so beautiful. It smells like a bride blushing away on her wedding day in a beautiful garden in the beginning of spring! It smells like her bouquet of white roses kissed by the early morning dew!

This without a doubt is what I will wear on my wedding day :)",07/11/17 02:08,shannfernando
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I'm writing this as someone who loves Chloe EDP and wears it almost every day. I love this scent as well and wish I had it in a bigger bottle but it's been very hard to find. To me this is lighter, fresher, and greener than the EDP (which I think of as less green and more pink). Chloe EDT is a very clean scent, very right-out-of-the-shower whereas the EDP, while still fresh and lush, is more sweet than clean. When I smell Chloe EDT I think of sparkling dew in a very well-manicured English lawn. Extremely feminine and very inoffensive.",06/16/17 10:55,sarahkdunning

It's a fresh cut roses fragrance, but there is something in this perfume that catches in the back of my throat and almost makes me feel like I'm going to have a sore throat just before a full fledge flu. A little to sharp for me, almost like a sparkling rose dish detergent.

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Just like the EDP, I smell freshly baked bread, warm and moreish and so fresh. It is definitely airier and more wearable than the EDP but yet still has amazing longevity and sillage for an EDT.

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I’ve been searching lately for something similar to Chloe edp but with less rose, and i ordered a sample of edt just to see whether it was different enough and in hope it will have less rose. Well, it is very similar to edp to my nose. It has the same coziness and retro vibe that I loved in Chloe edp, but it is also romantic, delicate, floral and as much roses, all the things I did not like so much in Chloe edp.
You probably buy any Chloe if you already like roses, i assume. For someone like me, who likes Chloes due to other reasons, it is a different way to go.

Chloe edt is lovely, fresh, floral, delicate scent. Opens a bit more watery, airy and fresher as edp, but as it dries down, they are very similar to my nose. It is really lovely, but not for me at the moment.

Good longevity, the same as edp on my skin. It lasted about 5-6 hours on me and then I went to bed.",06/16/15 02:17,Mirabele
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"There's a pleasant green aura in this one. Lightly floral (mostly rose, but discreet and airy), powdery but not dry. There's also a fruity element, but it's not citrus. Instead I'd describe the fruit in this as watery and sweetish. I seem to detect some benzoin and iris in the mix, too. Innocent, pleasant, pretty. Not ground-breaking, and quite safe. Clean, innocent floral powder might be a good blurb for this one.",05/29/15 05:03,ellina1984
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I have a feeling they are pulling this one from the stores. It's getting less and less available in the perfume stores. Only been seeing the big bottle or in some stores it's no part of the chloe signature collection at all anymore.

Just thought I let you know!",02/20/15 04:23,tinaelisa
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Chloe is green, floral, lightly powdery, rosy and not outdated in an unpleasant way. This is spry, mature and classy. The longevity is remarkable (as it is with most of Chloe's fragrances), but so far the eeriest spring scent I've come across.
My mind is connecting that's indelibly alarming, particularly at night. It's probably just cognitive to me personally, but that's what I think.
Sillage is heavy, & easily lasts 12 hours.
Un-yeilding and subduing, very much of a sunny scent. Simply doesn't match night time.
Smells fabulous in the morning.

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I have never reacted to a perfume as I reacted to this one. I tried it on my skin and within a few minutes I was feeling weird and sick! I was walking around the mall- waiting for it to dry and trying to ignore it, but keep feeling progressively worse. I was nauseous and just icky all over. It took me some time to realize that it was the perfume that made me feel this way. I found a bathroom and washed it off. Only then did I start to feel better. Surprisingly, no headache. I Thought I would love this one as I had smelled it on others and liked it. But, boy, was I wrong. Chemistry is a strange thing.",11/19/14 20:11,TMP

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Chloe Chloe Edp is my temptation. I want it so bad.
This one is also great, a lighter version of the EDP.
I love that kind of rose scents. Impressive.
Still, as I can't buy all of them, I would choose EDP over this one.
It is perfect!",10/23/14 14:28,ScarlettX
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I absolutely loved Chloe EDP and it was my signature for half a year. I loved the sophisticated feeling it gives off, and I thought i would love it forever. However, one day I tried it again, but there was something so chemical at the beginning that makes it screeching and overwhelming. I couldn't wear the EDP after that.

Then I came across Chloe Eau de Toilette. My impression of any EDT before is that it is a lighter edition of the EDP. However, Chloe Eau de Toilette is the younger, sweeter, more innocent sister of the EDP. All the goodness of the EDP is still there, but this time without the loudness and overwhelming scent that the EDP sometimes carries. I usually had to spray the EDP on me half an hour before going anywhere because it was too powerful. However, with the EDT, I can enjoy Chloe without being afraid that my perfume is too loud.

Chloe EDT is surprisingly long-lasting for an EDT. It lasts about 12 hours on my skin, probably the same longevity as the EDP. To everyone who dislikes Chloe EDP, try the EDT, you may be genuinely surprised.",08/29/14 17:31,Eirlys

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Hmmm it didn;t let me sleep and I must write few words about this. I once enjoyed a day all alone and was walking in city center and wanted to test some fragrances. I went for Chloe, this sheer bottle was hidden between all the Chloes on the shelf. I took this because I was curious what;s inside. I sprayed it and felt like it;s spring in a green garden full of small pink roses around, sheets were hanging and the wind blew into them. I smelled also something like roots of the roses. Sunrise, wind, the grass was wet because there was still a morning dew. I breath the fresh air from mountains. And than SLAP, I went from the store, the city was full of tourists and suddenly I woke up from a dream in the mountains and was in a dirty city. This fragrance symbolizes (for me) cleanness, nature, romantic moments, something little shy but with a big personality. I love roses and it;s here all about them. This will stay in my heart. I;ve found my signature... That;s enough.. So in love",03/28/14 14:37,kapek
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"As a die-hard oriental/gourmand fragrance wearer, it take a lot for me to praise a soapy floral scent like Chloe, which should tell you how fabulous it is. This is one of my favorite perfumes to smell on others. It is both soft and inviting without erring on the cloying or headache-inducing powdery side. I find peony and magnolia to be the dominant notes and most evident in the initial spray. The drydown yields more of a honeyed finish that is very cozy and a little unexpected. It is definitely evocative of clean linens or pricey bar soap. I find the bottle to be just beautiful, the type of thing you want gracing your vanity. This is probably a good scent for those picky folks who hate ""perfumey"" qualities (musk, amber, etc.) but want a little something to spritz. Elegant and modest.",03/21/14 12:56,Silkpuppet

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I don't understand why a lot of people describe this as 'old lady-ish'...probably the rose??

Personally I find this fragrance youthful and innocent. It's very clean airy and not as heavy as the EDP and a little more sweet.

To me, rose and iris are the most prominent notes and although I don't detect the watermelon or citrus so much, I am guessing they help to freshen it up and lift the fragrance so that it isn't old ladyish.

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I felt I need to post a comment because I discovered something new. If anyone f you is wondering what the difference between edp and edt is, I am going to answer you now the best I can.
First of all, many people say that edt smells the same like edp. I am sorry but not on wrist either a paper, they are not the same. It is not about how heavy they are. I think it depends on the personal skin type. The basic difference is, that they belong to the same scent family but:
edp is way more flowery, rosy,peony and fruits, sweeter, creamy.
edt instead, is a pure powder, freshness melon, It is like the nicest spring wash smell ever. So imho, I would use edp as the joyful more flirty one and edt as the ""pure"" adveturous and incredibly brave and a bit stubborn one. Both fit independent and carefree women. This is how I assosiate it. But I will never say that edt is the lighter version of edp in this case. they are just different. I love both and staying power and silage are good in both.",01/30/13 07:22,Margreet

Jag föredrar den här framför Chloe EdP. Jag vet inte varför, men Chloe EdP är bara för mycket för mig. EdT:n är lätt och luftig, samtidigt mer fruktig och mjuk. Den doftar pudrig ros medan EdP är mer intensiv. Den har det vackra, klassiska över sig utan att bli för stark. En fräsch vår och sommar doft. Fantastisk och en måste ha!!!",06/22/12 11:39,TaniaClamp

This fragrance is for a modern confident lady who knows what she wants and leaves a lasting impression. Yes, you WILL NOT be missed when you wear this scent!

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I'm usually not friend with these hyped design scents. I call them the ""luxury girls"", because they cost 2 thunders and a half for 50ml and you end up smelling like 80% fashion or wannabe-fashion girls.
Anyway I wanted to try this EdT and I'm glad I did, because it smells nice and highly wearable in spring.
Honestly I cannot think of it as a sandalwood perfume. The dominance is all about melon, fruit and freesia or a similar flower.
Not my usual kind of perfume, but very nice, quite fresh and elegant/refined for daytime with a modern chic outfit.
The lasting power and sillage are very good. It reminds me a little bit of Lanvin Marry Me! which is much louder and floral and more casual.
I could wear this if someone gave it to me as present, but it's not special enough to spend 80 euro for 50ml! This is crazy price!",03/28/12 06:44,Mellyhelly

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Chloe is a fragrance for young ladys with a classic sense of style. Its a perfume you can wear all year around in every situation I believe. I love to wear it in jeans and wool sweater but also in a night gown. I tested the EDP and I also think its a little bit to strong, in the line of Agent Provocatuer rose, but the EDT has the perfect amout of rose with a hint of sweet melon that gives this fragrance an airy vibe. Perfect for vintage lovers as the scent has this 60' vibe, but not in an old lady way.
Another good point is the lasting power and sillage that is extremelly good, Mugler sillage good!

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I've been out Christmas shopping and have decided on Chloe Edt for both my mum and my sister! I am touting this as a great Christmas pressie and not just because it has a cutesy ivory bow around its neck!

This smells so English, they might as well have called it Chloe English Country Cottage.

The opening is beguiling and lovely. They have left some peonie and lily-of-the-valley in with the freesia and roses. I am thinking carefully wrapped soaps in the cottage bathroom, looking out of the leaded windows across a perfectly manicured lawn, morning dew, dappled sunshine.

It soon settles into a powdery iris sandalwood base, the rose still there but now sharp and dry. It never strikes me as 'old lady' or dated but it does have that classic vibe. The movie reference?

It's nice enough and I can see how some people like it, but it's not really my cup of tea. It smells like something I've smelt a million times before, somewhere or the other. I'm going to give it another chance, though, because both my brothers, who hate most perfumes, seem to really like it.",09/21/10 14:00,atmosphere
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"While the original Chloe and Chloe Intense didn't rock my boat, Chloe EDT somehow manages to do so.

I find this version much sweeter, less heavy on the rose note and a tad fruitier. It still has that lovely, classic appeal that reminds me of old-fashioned, Arts and Craft stores with rose scented lotions and candles displayed on every counter in the shop.

Chloe EDT is Spring-like; bright, sunny and energetic. It is less like soap and more like a lightly scented powder or a scented hankerchief that your Grandmother so lovingly gave you many years ago.

I like its overall freshness. The melon and litchi notes stand out to my nose, giving this fragrance an interestingly light and fruity quality. The rose and freesia counteract with one another well, creating a slightly creamy, lotion-type texture.

I'm rather glad that I took the opportunity the test this, because if I hadn't I may have missed out on something so very lovely and delicate.",08/14/10 06:20,missk
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"At the beginning.. i did not like this scent. ACTUALLY. i did think it was old lady-ish ^_^..and too overpowering

but..

i changed my mind ever since i smelt this on a nice lady and i had to smell as elegant..

so i bought it ..


i got nice compliments..i will never stop buying this perfume. i love it!

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,I didn't like the bottle at first but then I found a sample in a magazine.It lasts a lot and make you feel that you have just had a shower.Sooo fresh.For spring and summer it's perfect.I must note that I hate Melon but in this perfume I cannot detect it.,04/04/10 11:07,katabra

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Got a sample of this yesterday, and wore it today because I had a training thing and wanted summat fresh-ish and subtle.

I wouldn't say it was that subtle, but it was pretty fresh. And even though it is pretty unique I think I've smelled it on a million women before because it seemed familiar.

Yes it's just a nice fresh floral, made me feel a bit tooooo girly though! :-) nice for summers day perhaps? or on holiday sure it'd bring back some lovely memories because of its uniqueness.

Lasts a looong time too. nice!",02/12/10 09:30,ChemistRhi
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Have to say its feminie & so alluring yet mysterious, without being harsh or loud. It is lighter than the original EDP but not as wholesome or deep.
However, that is what makes them both so special & balanced cz they completely different, yet they are quite similar.

My suggestion would be to use the EDT for day & EDP for nights, (although either are not restricted to day/night use), so then you will appreciate both within there own rights.",02/06/10 10:50,Ofeliarage

very soothing...
very relaxing...

Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Orientals are not my taste.
Florals are accepted in subtle doses.

Chloe EDT?
Light, likable, lasting.
Fluffy, feminine, fairy.
Pure, clear, virgin.

Since Im visiting Fragrantica I got disappointed numerous times, surprised everyday how happy some scents make me feel, fell in love several times.

Enchanted only once. By Chloe EDT.",09/06/09 03:59,zvoncica
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I was looking forward to testing this for months, but when I did it was a disappointing. First of all, there are not many differences between this and the EDP. Secondly, it is not as strong, which is what you'd expect from an EDT. And thirdly, when it says ""lighter"" it means getting rid of the honey, and adding a whole lot of lemon. Although, I think there are more flowers.

If anything, I find the ""obnoxious"" note even stronger. The major reason I didn't like this compared to Chloe EDP, is that the EDP settles into a deep, sweet, comfortable smell, whereas the EDT is sharper. I also think the EDP is more complex.",08/28/09 08:50,Taliera
Chloé Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I still find the Chloe EDP too strong, and quite frankly, obnoxious (but that's my personal opinion). However, after an hour or two it becomes hypnotizing - addictive - spellbinding - mesmorizing - I'm not really sure of how to describe it - but I really want it, just not the icky first hour or two. Therefore I'm guessing that Chloe EDT might be the way to go. Finally it has come to my local department store - but they don't have a tester - so let's hope that I'm right :)",08/21/09 02:35,Taliera
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I had a bottle back in 2015 and recently felt like I want to back to my perfumes I used around those years. Sad to learn this one discontinued, would be perfect for summer.",06/14/25 15:30,BrigitteGNR
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I found L'Eau de Chloé at the airport back in probably 2014-2015. Upon first smell I fell in love, but unfortunately I didn't get a bottle. I kept dreaming about having this perfume, but I was in a time of my life where there was no budget for such expensive things. I am devastated that its discontinued now, and just kept dreaming about this one.

I recently managed to find a sealed ""new"" 50ml bottle second hand. First I thought it had gone off, since the bottle was so old, because it wasn't the same fresh smell that I remembered. Its very patchouli heavy, unisex and slightly masculine, but it mellows down after an hour or so, and becomes a bit more like I remember it (but still lots of patchouli there). Layering this with a fresh citrusy scent like Clinique Happy takes me somewhat back to what I remember, but I guess it will never be the same. I want to like it, I think I don't though.

Dupe:
I read in here that Japanese Rituals by Tesori d'Oriente is a cheap dupe, so I got that one as well, and since its a new bottle, I could maybe get the fresh scent that I remembered from L'Eau de Chloé back in the day, just in case my bottle had in fact gone bad because of age.
I was surprised to see that my old bottle of L'Eau de Chloé and the new fresh bottle of Japanese Rituals by Tesori d'Oriente smell completely identical. Honestly no difference what so ever. I guess my L'Eau de Chloé didnt go bad, I might have just changed my preference in fragrance since then. Its just the patchouli that ruins it for me I think.",03/14/25 10:18,locg
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,My favorite of the Chloe EDP flankers. It smells like you've sprayed on the EDP and gone for a walk on a cool spring day just as flowers are starting to bloom. Then you walk by a house where someone's fresh laundry is in the dryer and all the scents intermingle in the happiest way. So sad this one is gone.,02/21/25 19:07,pie_pie_pie

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"This is an epitome of spring and summer mornings. Enjoying it very much in this time of the year! And don't be put off by the patchouli note, it isn't cloying here, I promise!
L 'Eau de Chloe is very green and clean, it reminds me of fresh laundry (I think it's the freesia + white musk). One of the most beautiful and unique scents I know, just pure happiness. I've already gone through two bottles and I'm so happy I managed to score a full 100ml bottle the other day. Discontinuing this heaven scent was a big mistake by Chloe, it's far superior to their recent offerings.",04/13/24 02:53,Salkavalka
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Monsieur Michel Almairac docet. Fragrance that praises the grandeur of spring, the solemnity of the floral world in its maximum expression, of its undisputed protagonist, the queen of the floral world: The Rose. Fragrance that evokes fabulous imagery: a sumptuous flower garden, a rose garden near a lush and sunny citrus grove in front of a fragrant forest. The Rose in all its immensity, immersed in citrus notes, notes of freesia and magnolia that echo superbly. An immense base, woody and musky, enveloping and intimate.",04/08/24 17:26,DariaFrancesca74

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I tried a spritz of this at Ulta a couple of years ago, and I liked it so much that I bought a miniature EDT on eBay. Well, I didn't open it up to use right away, mostly because I was trying to use up other fragrances.

I got it out yesterday to try and realized it smells a LOT like a sample of Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet that I got from Ulta a few years ago! I didn't really care for the Blooming Bouquet, but it wasn't awful, so I used it up.

To my nose, L'Eau has more aldehydes in the opening, but otherwise, it's extremely similar. It's OK, but I'm glad I have only .17 oz (5 ml) to use up!

I will say one thing for it. I have dry, perfume eating skin, and EDTs often last only an hour or two on me. This one lasted for at least 3 hours before becoming a skin scent.",05/02/23 00:53,fragrancenovice

Ever since it was discontinued I keep checking to see if it’s back or if anything like it is available. It was the best of Chloe in my opinion. If anyone identifies and knows where to find anything similar, please let me know. I can’t understand why Chloe discontinued it. Thank you!",01/21/23 15:22,Csnobrega
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I think a lot of people could not understand this fragrance. It's super pretty and very unique - alas, it is not for me, either.

THE NEXT BIT OF THE REVIEW MAY RUIN THIS EXPERIENCE FOR YOU SO READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!

If you are Hindhu or Buddhist, you may know this scent VERY well! This smells like the camphor before it is lit. This association ruined this for me. It is one of my least favourite temple smells. So I had to let it go - despite it being super hard to find.

I barely detect any rose. There's a ton of patchouli, oakmoss, citron and grapefruit, but no aldehydes :( From the house of Chloe my two true loves are Love, Chloe and Nomade. Nomade is stunning and it took me a long while to jive with it too! But now I am in love!

I envy you if this works on your skin chem and doesn't turn camphoraceous. If you have no idea what camphor smells like - go right ahead and use this, continue to love it and stay away from temples! haha

It's more of a Spring scent than summer. It needs a little bit of crispness in the air to work - perhaps mid fall, before it gets too cold just might work too! Definitely works best in the day time! A real beauty, ruined.",08/26/22 03:17,shannfernando
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,For those who are missing the sadly discontinued Leau de Chloe; Tresori de Orient Japanese Rituals is an excellent substitute. The scents are identical.

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Rose and patchouli is all my nose detects. I tried it in the Summer in a shop and liked it. Then forgot about it. Thought about it a few days later and found a nice offer so I bought a full bottle. And now, I can't for the life of me remember what was so charming in this fragrance. I remember lemons, but I cannot detect them at all now. It is pleasant but average, not too strong. I would say that it is for Summer, as the warmth may develop its depths of notes I seem not to be able to find right now. I will try it again in the warmer weather. But right now (outside there are -3 C) all I can smell is acid roses mixed with patchouli. Not one of my best impulse buys.",01/25/21 20:38,xabaras

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I had the lotion of this for years. It was fresh and youthful but sophisticated. The scent conjured the image of girl who at some point in her life would be a debutante.

I recently ordered samples of this fragrance because I never actually owned the perfume. I just knew I loved the lotion. Somehow my little sample is not quite hitting the spot. Maybe it’s a little too soft or the lotion base gave it that somewhat creamy vibe. I’m a sucker for anything that smells like body cream or lotion.

It’s still a pretty scent though.",09/09/20 16:08,danygurl06
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"The best Chloe edp flanker. It clearly smells like a rose perfume, which oddly the edp didn't. I'm enjoying L'Eau's green opening and bright finish. A lovely modern floral chypre.",05/14/20 07:50,Swedelish
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"L'Eau de Chloé opens with citrusy and green aldehydes. A bit medicinal but I suppose this might be due to aging of my sample. Fortunately the medicinal note fades in a few minutes, and the dry down is a light and summery aldehydic floral chypre, fresh and very feminine, both casual and serious. Oakmoss is the dominant note on my skin, like most chypres do, and longevity is very good, but it never feels heavy or cloying. This fragrance very easily wearable by everyone at the office, especially in the Summer heat. The little retro touch still manages to remain very modern, in the same style as Eau des Merveilles Bleue, N°5 L'Eau and La Panthère Légère ; if La Panthère had an Eau Fraîche flanker for Summer, the result would probably be close to L'Eau de Chloé.
Unfortunately this is discontinued and hard to find now.",02/27/20 11:28,Rose du soir
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I absolutely love this and I'm gutted its been discontinued, especially because it was discontinued before I managed to buy a bottle, but I got lucky and bought a 50ml bottle from a department store clearance.

As a daily wearer of Chloe EdT, (Its not my signature but really it should be, thats how often I wear it) I wear it for the very clean, fresh, scrubbed and well-groomed feel it has, I have worn it in the summer but sometimes it can be a bit too floral/cottony which is where L'eau de Chloe comes in!

L'eau de Chloe is just, wow, it smells like amazing soap and lemonade, sounds odd but it works. The original Chloe DNA is very prominent in it, but there is some extra soapiness/linen type notes in this, it also has a very persistent lemonade type nuance which runs through all the stages of this, from opening all the way to the dry down, the opening does smell vintage-ish, but it doesn't smell near as vintage as I thought it would with the colour being such a strong shade of, what I'd call 1960's-1970's green, and I think thats the other thing I love about this is how pretty and vintage it looks.

I'll be wearing and enjoying this one thoroughly during the warmer months, I would say I'd repurchase but I can't repurchase this one without great difficulty and expense, but its nice to say that I've had it and I enjoyed it, rather than be wishing I had the chance to try it and own it. I'll be trying the new Chloe L'eau which replaced this one, who knows, I may even love that one as much as I love the EdT and this one!",01/24/20 08:19,GinCatsBooks

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Ok, this flanker is different from all the other Chloe versions and in my opinion this should be a whole distinct perfume.

Not sure why it is discontinued, but it is absolutely amazing and made it my top 5!

I smell aldehydes, but crafted in a modern DNA, maybe if I were to compare it, somehow it reminds me of a softer, fresher and brighter Chanel 5 Eau Premiere (which I love). Hopefully I do not mislead anybody with my review, but this is by no means an old fashion scent, but a classy one that could fit any elegant lady over 25.

The opening is quite classic and within 20 min this turns in a wonderful creamy, musky, floral on my skin.

It is a day perfume and contrary of the name L'Eau, I do not find it citrusy and wearable in the summer heat, but more adequate on a spring or fall day.

I received compliments from people who would never say anything about my scents. If you wear it, you will stand out and feel special as probably nobody in the room will not know what you're wearing and a lot will be wondering what it is:)",10/07/19 13:59,Viviana21

I do agree with one of the reviews below, on my skin at first doesn't really have very strong aroma, but after awhile all is happening at once and the fragrance is blooming in a very nice sensual and in the same time kinda clean way. Do not understand me wrongly this one is not simple (or let say linear) one, on the contrary it is a complicated one. After the first half an hour I was not able to stop sniffing my wrist. All woods, citrus, bit of boozy-ness and all mixed up so well, that I actually my nose was/is not able to separate the ingredients, and to say which after which appears. I must go and buy this beauty immediately, especially I found it in a very, very good offer (hope there are still a few bottles in the store)...",04/29/19 12:06,Vanian

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I blind bought this based on the reviews, but I was nervous since rose is a difficult note for/on me. My skin doesn't work well at all with some rose scents. This one, however, is gorgeous! It's a fresh, clean and light rose. Like a newly sprung out, bright red rose on a dewy morning (almost all my rose containing fragrances have this kind of rose). I also get a lot of aldehydes, because this is super fizzy and sparkling on me. It's citrusy, fresh and slightly woody. The patchouli is there, but is never dark, rough or dusty, it just grounds the scent.

It behaves a bit funny. When I first apply it, I almost can't detect it, but after about 20-30 minutes or so...BOOM!! So I learned that I have to go easy on the trigger with this one and if I still don't smell it after 30 minutes I can apply some more. I think this can work all year around, but I think it really shines during spring and summer days.

It's really a pity that they discontinued this one, but I bought a 100 ml bottle so I'll be fine for a while.",06/30/18 03:10,CW81
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Although I'm usually a fan of fresh and green perfumes, that wasn't for me. It gave me a severe headache for some reason, and I'm typically enamored with Chloe perfumes like Love and Love Story. Had to give it away, and will not repurchase.",06/19/18 15:01,Nova_
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"What an absolute joy this one is to wear! It's so pretty and very easy to wear - light, fresh, crisp but with surprising sensuality and longevity to boot.

This is very ""Rose-y"" but not in an overly sweet or powdery way, tempered as it is by the zingy grapefruit and other citrus notes. It's a perfect springtime day scent.

This sadly, along with Love Chloe, is another masterpiece that Chloe seem determined to delist and replace with something massively inferior, derivative and wholly unoriginal (looking at Love Story and Nomade in particular). Why do they keep making fragrances I love and then taking them away from me!

L'eau De Chloe smells like lime and sherbert anc a little bit like aniseed to begin with. It almost disappears entirely but reappears as a rose patchouli, lighter than Elle YSL. Im wondering if in summer it will be stronger on skin. Its almost winter here and its a bit of a faint perfume.

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,I love almost all fragances from Chloé and this is one of my favourites. It’s a fresh green rose scent which is long lasting and has good sillage on me. I love how this perfume is different from the usual rose scents but the key to have a gentle floral scent wafting from my body is to spray in moderation. If I spray too much on myself then it smells like floor cleaner.,10/28/17 01:07,Fleur divina

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"At first you have a blast combination of rose and patchouli, a clean rose and herbal spicy patchouli, not dirty. Then it softens into a powdery scent close to skin and later becomes a skin scent. It's one of the perfumes that you spray liberally on your skin after a shower because you still want to smell clean and polished. Of course you have to wear your perfume of choice that lasts more, this won't do. A cute perfume for youngsters. Doesn't last well on my skin. So many notes... I can only tell rose, some soft powdery violet and patchouli.",04/07/17 13:29,iamoir

When I first got this i was not sure about it because i was only into sweet things back then, excusing valentinos creations because he is amasing, but now i have richer taste in perfume. I still prefer sweet perfum as all of my own perfumes are very sweet, such as valentina pink and gold edition juicy
la couture.

This is one of my favourite perfumes and i reccomend it to everyone who is interested in floral scents that enhance your surroundings beauty.

This has such a fresh scent. It smells as if you have teleported into a newly planted garden of flower have just spring ito season. Amazing!

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I got this as a blind buy but when I tried it, it wasn't an instant hit with me. I thought, it's pretty nice and left it at that. The more and more I use it though, I really am starting to love it. It reminds me a little of Chanel no 19 but soapier, cleaner somehow if that's possible. For days I just want a simple fresh without any fruit, something posh and elegant, this is it. I love it, it's super classy, not sexy, like a skin scent if you can afford the very finest lux soaps. I love it more and more every day. I wouldn't say it's a signature but I wouldn't be surprised if someday it might be!",11/27/16 14:29,Rebemario
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I thought I'd fall for this one, as from the bottle I got the impression that it's similar to Miss Dior Cherrie L'eau. but no, there isn't even a single similarity.
Chloe l'eau starts with a strong blast of citruses/ bergamot followed immediately with lots of rose water.patchouli/earthy notes make it deeper than a usual summer fresh perfume.
Actually it reminds me of Madame EDP by JPG and it's not surprising as they share lots of notes, but the main difference would be lack of pepper note here.
I can say it has the characteristics of all chloe perfumes, that I would describe as classy/french.The longevity and sillage are definitely not bad (just like prior and descendant ones).Still my favorite is the new one: love story.",10/11/16 03:43,tommy_girl
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Wow, so many notes and I detect only rose, patchouli and some citruses... Unfortunately rose and patchouli are the two notes that I can't stand in perfumes as dominant notes. Overall it's a pleasant, fresh, a bit spicy, and feminine fragrance, good to wear in hot weather.",10/01/16 05:04,dyaver
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I really do love Chloe, so this one was logical choice. To me, they are so alike, but different character. L'Eau de Chloe is more fresh and crispy with touch of citrus, but in the same time keeps that soapy luxury gentle powdery feeling. I was wondering if there is a sense of having both of them, but I simply couldn't gave up neither.
For me they are just perfect, with good longevity and silage, worth of every penny.
I am not a big fun of rose notes and happy to say, can not feel it here. But all notes are so well balanced and can not highlight any of them, nothing stands out, nothing loud. It is safe office scent and also great for dinner time out. Warm in winter and gentle in summer, simply all year around for all occasions.
I think if it is labeled with Chanel brand, it would get higher rating.",07/30/16 08:21,Tussa
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"The biggest note that drew me to this perfume isn't even listed.... camphor! It's so strong to my nose! Obviously it's not the whole scent... and certainly not what hits the top of the smelling experience... but for me there is well and truly a strong undercurrent of good old camphor. This is a beautiful sweet-but-not-sickly fragrance, balanced by the slightly harsh green effect of camphor. Love it!",07/05/16 03:34,kazzibee
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I love this so much, one of the bests of summer scents, so sophisticated and yet fresh and delightful. It does not get too overwhelming even in the hottest weather, it is like a fresh nostalgic lemonade cocktail on a balcony of an elegant bar.",06/22/16 11:22,Percoon
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I really like this. It's a lovely citrus floral that lasts and lasts. This screams warm weather. I tend to like ""wall of scent"" perfumes that can be oppressive in the summer, so am looking forward to having this for the Alabama heat. Starts off strong, so a spritz or two will do.",06/21/16 18:41,faerywren
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Loooove this scent. It is so interesting. At first it is very lemony and fresh but it soon changes and becomes powdery, slightly soapy and on my skin, pretty spicy. It develops into a warm, sexy scent which lasts 10+ hours. It could easily be worn year around IMO. To me it is very different from Chloe EDP. It actually reminds me of Bath and Beauty by Jil Sander which my mum used to wear back in the eigthies. I loved that scent too but it just did not work with my skin chemistry. Happy this one does work for me!!",05/20/16 13:10,kristelg
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,This one is great. Much less of that metallic twang that keeps me from enjoying the edp. Smells clean and rosey on the skin and is long lasting. A good one for wearing to social functions where you want to smell nice but not necessarily be noticed. The best one of the Chloe range IMO.,04/29/16 10:05,jana.hullinghorst
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"This is a day perfume worn by a together, stylish and wealthy suburban mom in the 1970s, who doesn't want the heat and grime of the city but is far too sophisticated to live in the country. I am not kidding. The first time I smelled this, it reminded me completely of sitting in church as a kid in the 1970s -- one of the ladies at our church in the well-to-do city suburbs must have worn this every Sunday, and I smelled it then, and I smell it now, with L'eau de Chloe. I had to buy it, since it triggers such calm nostalgia in me. Think of the Mary Tyler Moore mother figure in the film ""Ordinary People"" (but without the bitchiness, just the perfect hair, tennis and golf afternoons, etc.) All I have to do is put it on, and I think of the sharp, citrusy, ""jazzy"" scents that ladies wore in the 70s. This is a strong perfume on me. It is very green -- not as far into green as Estee Lauder's ""Aliage"", but it is in that family. It is energetic without being truly sporty, stylish and sharp but with no hint of sex, or seduction or floral flirtatiousness. If you're trying to seduce a man, this is not the perfume. It has a sophistication you can't miss. And it also has a hint of ""Love's Fresh Lemon""(which all the daughters of the those 70s mothers were wearing). I love to wear this when I want to carry off myself as energetic but not aggressive, sharp but not bold, and stylish without being trendy. I reach for this at least once a month, and never get tired of it.",04/24/16 17:10,ArianeArborene'sNose
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I hear how classy and romantic house of Chloe is. Today I decided to try this as well as Love Story that I both liked. Let's stay to L'Eau.

When I first sprayed, my senses woke up! I said yeah, finally something different and good enough to impress me. Bottle is really nice, green details and juice. I have to admit that my first though was: ""Too bad I never smelled Miss Dior Cherie L'eau but who cares after smelling L'eau by Chloe?""

All in all, I just adore it. I am 99% sure that there must be a Chloe signature scent for me and why not L'eau? Trust me, I hate when people comparing perfumes but L'eau reminds me so much of Nina Ricci-L'extase! It's not bad, but L'eau is better to my nose. I dislike rose but this sweet lokum-like rose is amazing, bright citrus tones that are so well and sweet again. I won't talk much for the rest tones that are so many but so well mixed. The perfumer deserves congratulations. A perfume for work, for meeting friends, for whatever cosy, friendly and at the same time romantic comes in your mind. So original and so bold.
L'(eau) V E it! <3

p.s: Although I think it's my favorite from Chloe, I have a feeling I'll fall from another one. Why? In general and in testing paper it smells lovely but on skin, it gives a feeling of a soapy perfume. Ok, tell us something new you will say about Chloe perfumes, but this one it's like freedom. I will run to test more from Chloe <3",04/21/16 20:21,Kon-nos91
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,I sprayed this on paper and I smell citrus green scent. No rose and no patchouli. Maybe on the skin it will smell a bit different.,04/12/16 17:10,mluckyg
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I find this to be an almost challenging perfume. It is so unlike anything else I have.
After the first spray it is ridiculously green for a long time, probably at least 2 hours on my skin. Quite sharp, green cut vegetation, freshly felled trees and earth is all I get, no roses and definitely nothing sweet. It's also more fresh spicy than warm spicy.
The green softens slowly and other notes become noticeable, I start sensing green cut roses somewhere in the background and wonderful earthy notes. The woody roses slowly move to the fore over the next few hours.
After about 8 hours the green has totally softened and the lightly sweet and woody rose has now become the star.
Definitely not a boring perfume, at least with my chemistry.
Silage is close and longevity is very good.",03/04/16 06:52,MindyMe
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I hardly sense any resemblance between this and the predecessor it is supposed to flank, but that's OK. Perfect rose-citrus fragrance. Not a fan of patch, but works very well in this formula. Always been a fan of Chloe fragrances, and this one did not disappoint. This year, it's been one of the hottest summers I've ever experienced, and L'eau de Chloe has been my staple through the season. Crisp, soapy at times, but not cloying. I must have another bottle when this one runs out.",02/14/16 01:37,tessaeastgate
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"It is just beautiful!!!!
On my skin it lasts all day even under the scorching sun.
Refreshing and bright, and sparkling, crispy as has been mentioned before.
For me a great staple. It has that kind of detergent sharpness like Chloe, but more luxurious.
The patchulie, citrus and rose together are perfect utter luxury.
I just simply wanna drink it!¡!!!",02/06/16 14:07,dormir6
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"The main difference between this and the EDP 'Chloe' is that it is much greener and possesses a sweet touch of spice. The feminine powdery-ness of the original is gone and the scent of roses is muted and really doesn't come off as a top note in L'Eau. The dry down is calmer and more mellow from the initial burst coming from the lighter notes and the patchouli. It's soft enough to be a daily fragrance IMO so long as it's sprayed moderately. Can't say how often I'll personally use it, but it's much more well rounded than the stronger-scented oriental and woody fragrances that use patchouli in their scent accords (fresh's Cannabis Rose, Miss Dior, etc.).",01/03/16 16:39,melpomeni
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"My love for L'eau De Chloe started with the shower gel I purchased at a pharmacy. Everytime I showered with L'eau De Chloe I felt transported to a place of luxury. The smell like an exquisite soap lingered on my skin all night. Anyone who used the shower after me said how amazing it smelt. I had to have this fragrance and so I did purchasing a 50ml bottle. It is such a unique fragrance being a fresher version of the chloe edp. I Have both fragrances and they are both amazing. So feminine,uniqiue and classy!",12/30/15 01:09,hails_blogger
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I love the fresh citrus scent, perfect for the day, specially summer, this fragrance reminds me a little of Coriandre, it works perfect with my body's chemistry I get lots of compliments on the scent. I think that even though the main scent is citrus, the combination with the floral makes this fragrance very elegant.",12/21/15 19:56,IleanaM
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Wow!
Amazing!
Just discovered this goodie!
So different, fresh and clean.
Green, but not too sharp, sweetness prevails.
It's not trendy, however it's not dated either!
You will get asked what you are wearing!
I can see this being an all season scent.
If you're lucky enough to find this, scoop up
A couple bottles, you won't be sorry.

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,I love this fragrance. It is very warm and soft when it is mixed with my body chemistry. It smells extremely green and sophisticated. It reminds me of Coriandre but the smell does not seem to last as long. My husband really loves it. I wear this in Spring and Summer.,11/30/15 15:55,Jenken98
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I find this a bit fresher version of Moment Bonheur L'EAU YR ,sweet rosy way with summer wind fresh vibe. And a nice surprise that a green flacon hides not a ""green"" fragrance. Cuz i am not a fan of green scents. I am really enjoying this one.
Connection of rose patchouli with fresh/citrus mix. Cant wait to try it in summer",11/23/15 09:34,kati77
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,I don't understand how some don't Smell rose. It's the very first note I Smell and continue to Smell throughout the fragrance life. It's like rose soap. Clean and classic.,10/06/15 21:08,lesecretforme

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"From smelling this several times on a strip of paper at my local Olive Young's, I get a very green and earthy impression. I smell zero rose, though definitely some unidentified floral. I don't smell jasmine. I do smell patchouli, but it's vague and so mixed with other, sharper odors that I don't always notice it. It is a ""soapy"" fragrance.

Update 9/27/15: can Pine-Sol be a note? cause that's what I identified this time...",09/15/15 07:02,mrs.hunter
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Have this sample at home for 2 years, didn't give it a chance (I don't like the Chloe EDP, EDT and intense version at all) but either didn't throw it away.
At the moment I'm in the mood of unstraining, light stuff and this is a really nice little pastel-green thing. There is a white and slightly bitter musc tone in it, that makes me think of cruder ""white bleach""-perfumes like ""Anna"" or byredos ""Blanche"", but here it is used in a way that I like, as a base, gives it a quite nice lasting power also.
Edit: I finished my tester and that is it. I must have had a confusing time. Maybe I'm already too old for this one.",09/09/15 01:58,lisa o
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I have tried and enjoyed many of this house's perfumes, but this L'eau reaches a whole 'nother level of appreciation. All the notes are so well balanced, like an elegant symphony of scents working together perfectly to make a delicately earthy, fresh, scent which leaves a drydown reminiscent of soap, but delicious luxury soap, not cheap hotel soap. It strikes that rare but beautiful perfume balance of being noticeable without any risk of being overbearing. Lasts at least 6-8 hours on me, but stays close to the skin, which I cannot stop sniffing. I am besotted by this perfume and love spraying a little on before I go to bed. My summer nightgowns all smell delicious and I catch the scent on my sleep-warmed skin whenever I pause in my night's sweet slumbers, which is often because I have insomnia, but that's another story...:-D",08/23/15 19:01,MiaClaire
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I am a huge fan of (nearly) every fragrance from the house of Chloe, which was why I was so surprised with this one. It's really completely different.

First off, I am not here to bash a perfume that is not my style. I'm reviewing my impressions of it.

I don't know how rose is listed as an accord - at all. I don't get ANY rose at all. This perfume is GREEN. Then green, then some more green. All I could smell with this was fresh cut vegetation - truly like something growing in a garden or outside and had been cut. If that is a style you like, then you are going to enjoy this one. If that's not a style you like, you will most likely strongly dislike this. This was a near immediate return for me.

It's my own fault for getting caught up in a blind buy without smelling first or reading the description, but even then there is no way I would have gotten an indication of of ""vegetation"" that seems to comprise this scent.

In my own perfuming hobby, I have learned to rely more on the accords of a fragrance rather than the notes, and that is helpful to me. I feel, however, that the accords are way off on this one. Warm spicy? NO. Rose? NO! Earthy? Yes.",08/13/15 11:02,Fragrance Lover 30
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"When you find good perfumes at Marshall's and TJ Max ,it's a good indication they are being discontinued. BTW I really like this Eau de Chloe, but to me it smells like sparkling labdanum.",08/13/15 10:58,dolcemela
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"L'eau de Chloe is one of my all time favorites. At first spray it has a very zesty, thirst quenching quality and settles down into a nice soap like fragrance with a hint of rose. I can't stop smelling my wrists as it's an addictive fragrance. It is perfect for hot humid days and even more beautiful on a cool spring morning just after a shower of rain. The downside is that it is an EDT so it doesn't hold for long. I have to end up spraying this 6-8 times to see it last for about 6 hrs. This will always be in my collection.. As long as I can find it as if has been discontinued.",08/10/15 11:21,angela.thrasher.92
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"If L'Eau de Chloe were a girl, she would be cool and fresh in a summer day. However, she is too shy n jst disappears soon. L'Eau de Chloe is too light in the hot weather n jst keep fading away. So ashamed cause the smell s suitable for a hot summer day",07/30/15 10:28,ph_nguyen
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"At first sniff, i thought this is not about what i'm thinking at all. it's green and too green for me. i haven't smell any fruit and flower in the notes at all, i hate this so i've voted dislike to it. Even i try it for few times, the result still same. So i gave it to my mom, she's very love it and told me to buy full bottle for her birthday in next couple months.( i got 5 ml. decant )

After that, today, i decided to try it again ( i wonder why my mom so love it, in fact )

The result is : I like it, very like it. It's fresh but not like floral or fruity at all. It's still green in their way that make me feel fresh, like a kind of cooling powder with fresh patchouli. I still wonder where all the flower such as jasmine and freesia gone? i haven't felt to it. But i really like it now. Scent like no other. great for a hot summer day.

may be in next couple months, there are 2 full bottles of this in my house.",07/30/15 06:17,AgentEffex
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Very classy and elegant, work appropriate . I hated it at first as I smelled it from the bottle, sprayed it on my wrist and 2 hours later I ran back to buy it (20 ml ) i will purchase the largest bottle as this scent does not last long enough on me however I will still wear it because I fell in love with it",07/05/15 13:28,Esztee
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Based on some comments below, and after having checked the wardrobe and taste of those who thumbed up this perfume, I went to sniff it.

I have both Chloé and Chloé Intense and like them pretty much. At first, I thought that l'Eau would not be me cup of tea. At all. I was wrong.
It has nothing to do with any other Chloé of this line. It's fresh, light and discreet. Citrus is prominent, and to my chemistry so is the cedar. It makes it a bit masculine and woody, which I like.
Its longevity is pretty good: 6-8 hours on my skin. Does not radiate much, though. Within arm length.

I was looking for a summer scent, this might be the one.",06/09/15 04:50,Eicher
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Very fresh and zingy scent with the same familiar Chloe elegance. The greens, the soap and the rose powder, a perfect trinity which gradually stirs together into a wonderful organoleptic amalgam as the day passes.

Great scent all around. Although I wouldn't mind it in a stronger concentration.",05/11/15 04:04,PastelMoon
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Still more powdery than a genuine fresh scent because of the rose, but definitely a lovely light and all-round uplifting fragrance. I love both this and Chloe, and Chloe intense.",05/01/15 04:17,the_new_esta

Truly love it... it is pretty similar to the original but greener...It's not too fruity or too floral..I think that anything by Chloe is a must!!!",04/27/15 02:29,paggeo
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I just got this since I wanted a green fragrance for summer....and I know this isn't a helpful review but I just don't like it. It's not as green as I wanted, so I was hoping for more patchouli, but got none of that either. The silage is terrible. I got it cheap online , I may just go and check out either Chanel no. 19 and splurge.....",04/13/15 21:00,Emilee1978
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I am thoroughly disappointed in this one. I got a lovely gift set with the shower gel, lotion, and I believe 100ml bottle of this at Costco for a really affordable price ($64.99 I think?)--and it just doesn't last. 10 sprays got me 3 hours of wear. TEN. SPRAYS. And this was layered over the body lotion. The bottle is cute, but the top is already oxidizing and looks manky (like all the Chloe bottles do), so that's a minus point as well.

If you are looking for a VERY lightweight *expensive* citrusy scent that smells like expensive lemon hand soap and doesn't last very long, you can stop looking. This is what you're looking for. I got no patchouli, no amber, no cedar, no peach, no violet, and only a hint of rosewater. Lemony rosewater. The drydown is a nice clean dryer sheet smell, although VERY faint.

I can't compare to Coriandre, as I just recently got a decant of that one, but this one was not for me.",04/09/15 11:05,Lipglossjunkee
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"A couple of years ago I was poking my way around the duty-free shop in Barcelona and was drawn to the pale green tint of this scent. I sprayed it on my arm and was transported back to the early eighties. Why? Because L'Eau was so similar to Coriandre, which I used to wear all the time. I had to have it! I think it is fresh and green enough that it could be enjoyed by men who like this kind of fragrance. Wearable year round but particularly refreshing in warmer months.",03/02/15 14:16,viridian
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"It is a very nice and coquette perfume, light, green and powdery but doesn´t last very long on me can´t smell it on me an hour later...I love it though. It does remind me a bit of Sisley´s perfume the one with the golden head, Eau de soir I think...but just a lot lighter and softer.",02/28/15 03:11,Rinio
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I was surprised that L'Eau de Chloe Chloe is actually quite strong, long-lasting fragrance. Still a hint of powder in it as in all Chloe fragrances. The top notes are more than delicious – you suddenly appear on a meadow, full of grass, daisies and white flowers. Like a light breeze of spring. In time, the scent gets heavier but still comfortably wearable.",02/24/15 05:16,MartaL
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"<3 <3 I love L'Eau De Chloe! To describe how it smells to me, I think it almost has the exact scent as the original Chloe Eau De Parfum, but A LOT lighter. When I first tested out Chloe EDP, I liked the scent, but there was too much for me, and I didn't think I could safely wear it for most occasions (I'm not a big perfume person). So I had to pass up on it. But then there came l'eau de chloe! Unlike the original, this one is so light and airy. I hardly smelled a thing when i first sprayed it, but once it touched my skin, magic started to happen. In about 5 minutes, I smelled an earthy citrus note. A little bit harsh, but that died immediately in the next 10 minutes. And in less than 30 minutes, what was left on my skin was just a very soft, sweet, rosy scent much like the chloe EDP. Despite how light and soft it was, the scent soon penetrated through my clothes, and put me in a beautiful aura. It seemed to me that my blood flow was giving it constant momentum. Very amazing sillage for a perfume that is so light! And I could still smell it on my after 8 hours. It is a very quiet and intimate scent. I like to spray it all over my body in the morning without worrying and really enjoy the ""shower"" of freshness. It is one of those scents that will make other people wonder if you're actually wearing perfume, but they will for sure notice that you smell AMAZING! <3 <3

This is signature worthy! I give it 10/10. :)",01/21/15 15:02,Treslicious
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Rose rose rose. Beautiful and fresh. I adore this. It makes me feel like a woman, like the perfect mom.

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Very Green, fresh, sweet, awake, happy, sunny and rosy! Citrus, roses, patchouli, and fruit makes such a lovely combination that reminds me of green melons like honeydew and such. I did see others mention this as room spray/freshener, which is funny because I love to spray it not just on myself but also on clothes, sheets, rooms, everything! I have also the body wash of L'eau Chloe and I wish there was a candle or room oil version! But I dont find that it is truly ""room spray"" scent. The L'eau is an easy, not heavy or offensive, fresh, juicy and feminine scent that I adore so much that I would like to have everything smell like it. When I smell this, I immediately wish for dresses, sandals, mojitos, sunshine and light breezes.",01/19/15 02:41,Pepperflower
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"On 1st spray, it has a menthol smell, reminiscent of citrus cough drops. Thankfully, it changes very quickly. Within a minute, the rose and patchouli starts coming through, followed by amber. It reminds me of spring, when you look outside and realize that finally, the cold is going away, the sun is not too hot and the flowers are beginning to bloom. The dry down is very comforting and I am not sure why. The violet is very shy. It reminds me of sitting in my grandma's sun room at the end of a newly spring day, relaxing with the satisfaction that the day has been good. The patchouli is prominent the entire time for me. I am not a big fan of citrus or fresh scents, but because of the patchouli, I like this one a lot.

EDIT- Sillage is very low, and I wish it was higher. This is coming from someone who prefers skin scents... I can only smell if I sniff 1-2inches from my skin with multiple sprays in the same spot!",01/17/15 14:59,Oamae
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Ahh, i just dont understand my nose.

When i first tried this, i get the very green bath room cleaner, air freshener smell people talk about. Needless to say, i put this away at the very back of my perfume wardrobe.

I was bored and tried this again last week and voila! I got a fresh green citrus smell and L'eau dried down to a rosey smell not unlike Chloe. I could not be more happy. I will be wearing this happily even though it's raining cats and dogs here now. The rainy weather suits it, for me at least.",01/15/15 00:21,SilverZeru

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,I have a similar type of scent before. To me it smells like a mature scent. I smell a hint of musk or peppermint. Also a hint of a note often used in male perfumes.,12/03/14 19:55,Togiii
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I received the Parfum de Roses Miniature Collection as a gift which came along with a mini L'Eau. First time I dabbed small amount on my wrist and liked it a lot. It's an unconventional tangy rose scent that didn't smell old (like so many other rose scents). Very crisp. Dried down smoothly although ended up rather soapy.

One day I decided to wear this in full volume and dabbed L'Eau on my wrist, collarbone and belly. I instantly smelled the sharp greed edge of L'Eau and as the day went by the sourness lingered and it gave me a really bad headache, and I love green notes to begin with!

Bottom line: put little on it smells wonderful; put a lot on you notice all the bad names it's given (toilet cleaner, lemonade, sharp, irritating). Definitely revealed the rose note as it dries down but with large amount the dry down is not smooth at all. If you really like unbalanced citrus this may be for you.",11/17/14 21:47,pepperoniann
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,Just got it and it smells amazing. I don't know why I hesitated to try this scent before as I have all of the Chloe scents. I though maybe it would not be different enough from Chloe itself boy was I wrong. So woody almost like an Oud smell to it. It's so strange and yet it's fascinating. Chloe has not let me down. That why I love this house so much. If you want a dupe for less try Haiku Kyoto Flower Avon for women. It's the same scent with really good silage as well.,10/25/14 12:48,ojosverdes
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I understand the comparisons to shampoo, detergent, or even air freshener. It smells very clean and fresh and it's even soapier than the original. It almost smells like a freshly cleaned bathroom outfitted with rose scented toiletries - A not unpleasant smell, but not so much what one wants one's person to smell like.

The progressively powerful rose note is its saving grace. As it dries down it smells less like Lysol and more like rosewater sprayed on clean skin.

After a couple of tries, I still can't decide whether I like or dislike it. ""Ambivalent"" probably best describes my attitude toward it.",09/20/14 06:30,HanamiTsukimi

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I might need to give it another test run, but I tried this one today and the opening smelled oddly mentholated and reminded me of cough drops and the dry down was barely perceptible.",06/29/14 20:21,moreorlessa
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I adore citrusy scents but it's very rare for me to like something so straight up lemon and grapefruit in the opening as L'Eau de Chloe is. Moreover, I actually like that the citrus lingers even in the dry down here. I think this perfume is very well balanced notes-wise and blended wonderfully. On my skin it would actually smell the same as the original Chloe - the only difference is the added citruses. Probably it isn't considered too original, but I like the idea. Very easy to wear, stays fresh all the way until it finally disappears so it's perfect for the hottest, suffocating heat in the summer. Longevity is great considered how light and fresh this perfume is, and sillage is good as well.",06/22/14 07:05,labradorite
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I wanted to LOVE the original Chloe because I love feminine, romantic scents....but that one came across as a very aldehydic artificial French milled soap to me. This version, however, is much better for my chemistry. I love the lovely opening full of green notes and citrus. Then the florals and soft woods kick in. I can imagine walking through a Victorian garden, wearing a long white flowly dress during the spring when wearing this. Very soft, delicate, feminine, innocent, and clean.",06/02/14 02:41,Aeris

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I sampled this at a duty free shop. I am not sure what happened on my skin but it immediately smelled like someone doused me in pickle juice. Tart, powdered alum, dill and vinegar, straight up in your face pickle juice. My daughter came up behind me and was looking at some of the other Chloe scents & suddenly blurted out, ""Ooooh! What in the world smells like dill pickles?!""
This seems like it would be a scent I would enjoy by the list of notes. Has anyone else experienced this oddity on their skin as well? I’ve now smelled it on paper & it was so pretty…

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I got this when it first came out and I really do like it but citrus perfumes are funny in a way because I find that the scent changes and might even go a little stale after a while. Recently I smelled it just for fun at a Sephora and it smelled so awful. I think it's because they have bright lights on the display shelves and that contributes to the change in the scent. I try to keep all my perfumes in a cool dark place, especially the summer citrus ones.",04/27/14 05:40,EternityFresh
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"SCREEEEEEEEEEEECH!!!!
Awful, awful interpretation of Chloe Signature. Starts off sharp, tangy (not in a good way) and then gives you some B.O.-like citrus. So, so nasty. I LOOOOOVE the original Chloe Signature and this was a huge disappointment.",04/06/14 02:56,ThisIsEmilyKate

Youthful freshness.",03/15/14 08:48,ScarlettX
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,My immediate reaction is that it reminds me of that cheap tuberose spray you buy at the grocery store. It gives me a headache. Dries down to smell like soap. I'll give it to a friend who loves rose perfumes.,03/12/14 17:49,Lillitth
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Al inicio detecte mucho el pachuli, luego se transforma en algo super femenino, es la versión ligera de Chloe EDP (rosas frescas, limpias), con un toquecito cítrico, al secar, en mi, queda el puro pachuli (otra vez).

Su duración es muy buena, pese a ser EDT, al menos unas 8 horas, y si no fuera porque en mí se queda demasiado el pachuli me encantaría.

Me sigue gustando mucho más la original.",03/07/14 08:57,SeleneHdez
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I keep trying it, but I find it a bit flat, like most Chloe perfumes, and formal..not exciting to me. I would feel like wearing a restrictive perfume, if that makes sense!? It lacks warmth, but I can see why some will like it, it is in fact easy to wear, it is light, suitable for any occasion.. Like wearing almost nothing..too crisp and clean for my nose!!",03/03/14 21:20,genny17
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I usually don't like these kind of perfumes, but this one is lovely. I'm usually more drawn to warm, spicy vanilla perfumes like Chanel Coco. This is very simple and suitable for spring, very fresh. I can mainly smell rose and some citrus, but not too much citrus. A much fresher version of the original. Makes me think of rain (and the perfume Rain by Marc Jacobs, as well).",03/03/14 21:01,paneradfisk
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Oh, Chloé. How I wanted you. How I tested you, long ago, and how you've changed since then, somehow, upon purchase. A lot of people complain about certain aspects of this fragrance: the citrus opening, the powdery-clean middle. But not me. Those were the notes I wanted. The fragrance opens so beautifully, with a pure, crisp lemonade feel, perfect for spring and summer. It is softened by its rosewater heart. If this were all it was, I would still love it, and not have regretted lusting after it for over a year. But almost as soon as I spray, and all along until it fades many hours later, something is amiss here, and only gets worse. It may be the ""soap"" note people have reported. But more than likely, I feel, it's that patchouli. Perhaps it's my skin, but the people who claim there's no patchouli here are wrong. A few minutes into the fragrance, it takes over, a hot, sharp, dry patchouli that gives me a massive headache without fail every time. This patchouli ruins it as a summer scent and ruins those promising top notes. I just can't accept this fragrance as it is. Beautiful packaging, crisp opening, all destroyed by hours of that lingering, scratchy herb. If only it had been created with a simple, light woody base, I can imagine what could have been. But L'Eau de Chloé, for all its outer beauty, in the end let me down.",02/19/14 21:56,Selo12394
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I don't like it. I don't like the smell of the green. I don't like the smell of the powder wafting in the air. I don't like the hints of citrus.

It's green, fresh-y, citrus-y, some powder-y, and it certainly gives off sweet floral notes in it too.

Every note I can't stand in one bottle.
It's not the fragrance for me.",01/31/14 17:40,Misspermata
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"i didnt knew its notes but at first spray i was like ""patchouli? again?"" the patchouli all you can smell at first. but then it turns to green citrusy smell. its young, fresh, happy smell. perfectly fits on summer or spring days. unfortunately my skin doesnt show the rose notes yet(it only show rose water).",01/30/14 07:20,ecerusen
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Errrr.. This smells as if dove soap had it's own house in france. I kinda wish the notes were spread out for an Oh-factor.. atlas it's subtle & chic as chloe's house. If you're hanging out in leggings/sweatshirt with a messy bun this is going to make you feel alot less sloppy as you grab a cup of coffee.

It smells quite sharp from the bottle, it mellows to a gentle floral with mild soapy woody-spice coming through on dry down. As with all chloe perfumes, they are uncomplicated & simple. They make me feel organized & minimalistic. (Although i do prefer chloe see, more)
Every perfume has a time & place. This one for me is if I want to feel clean after a long flight. Or the morning after a party.

I am tipping my toe into the floral world & i find chloe is the best way to start!",01/24/14 00:53,skylar666

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Nice surprise to me, as I usually don't like Chloe scents, especially old editions. (Newer are more compatible to my skin)
L'eau de Chloe starts like a green, spring garden, and that is a bit strange, as I can't see any green ingredients in top notes. However, after some time, rose-violet heart starts smelling beautifully. It is really pleasant, clean smell, just perfect for hot season.
But, to love it, you need to love green notes.",01/12/14 08:32,Arlene-Beatrix

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"L'eau de Chloe is wildly beautiful with a heart of rose.

I imagine L'eau de Chloe to be a nature-loving, runaway princess with a past much like that of princess Chloe EDP (if Chloe EDP broke free of her regal fate).

This is my favorite fragrance. The notes smell so fresh and this is my favorite rose. I find it to be freeing and grounding all at once.

L'eau de Chloe starts out very citrusy, like frozen lemonade but I can also smell the fresh green patchouli. The patchouli smells like it's been freshly cut at its greenest, most vibrant point in it's growth.

When the citrusy notes settle down, they reveal the rose bellow. This is the heart of the fragrance. The song of Chloe.

Chloe rose perfumes already feature the quality rose notes but here there is the poignant addition of rosewater to this fragrance—the outcome is so soft, yet so authentic that it strikes an poetic cord with me.

When the rose fades, I am left with the soft green garden of patchouli and a faint echo of the notes that have come before.

Though I have come to know it well, I feel that there are always newfound meanings and beautiful visions to bring forth from within the simple, yet ever-spirited melody of L'eau de Chloe.",12/06/13 13:53,Pink_Ruffles

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"On my skin it definitely lasts longer - not sure where the complaints come from. I sprayed it on about two hours ago and it's still going strong. It's distinctly Chloe, something else I don't understand about the other reviews. I've been wearing the Chloe Eau de Parfum for a while now, and at first thought it was what I was smelling on my watch, until I realised it's L'eau de Chloe... It becomes different as it develops though, with the citrus accord taking the lead, where both rose and lychee are more distinct in Chloe Eau de Parfum. To me the character of L'eau de Chloe is fresher, younger, more summery than the Chloe Eau de Parfum version. I would recommend it to the 30 year and younger age group. It's true what someone else here said - there's a slight (very slight) similarity with Chanel No 19. Incidentally I tested both today, but I prefer Chloe by far. Chanel perfumes generally have a too clean, too perfect, slightly cold, distant feel to me. Not this. Love Chloe. Pure class, pure femininity.",11/30/13 02:13,indorm

I don't know if its just my skin chemistry, but citrus perfumes tend to smell synthetic on me, and this one reminds me too much of cleaning products. The dry down is more enjoyable, once the lemon note settles and the florals start to peek out, but because of the harsh lemon cleaning product chemical smell in the beginning I give it a ""like"" rather than a ""love.""",11/16/13 20:48,Beckylynn8881

I avoid all chypres but a couple samples were included in an order I made so figured I give it a try, a tiny sprintz.

This smells like frozen limeaide to me, yes limeaide not lemonaide. I do detect the faint rose & patchouli in the background but not strong enough to bother me.

I dont know if I could wear this often or for long periods of time, but I do see me wearing this occasionally in the spring so my samples will probably be enough for me for now.",10/15/13 23:15,mad.kat.96

it more retro than vintage. kinda reminds me of paloma piccaso, just not as seveve.
a very pretty fragrance, withiut a hint of sweetness. very woody drydown.
i know its meant to be a summer scent, however , i think it would work well in all weather. i can imagine how the frosty weather would bring out the crispness of the scent. and i also think great for evenibgs with a black dress.

But I find it too clean and soapy for my taste, I think it lacks some base notes.
Update spring 2016: I'm really surprised that patchouli has gotten so many votes, because I don't smell it - at least it has to be an extremely clean, bright and un-earthy patchouli accord!",08/14/13 13:23,Elisa S
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"So far I had L'Eau de Chloe on paper test card. Right after spraying could not bear it: have written in pencil ""indolic"". It also smelled plastic like.
Frustrated, I wondered, if it would be the second (after ""Love"") fragrance that I can not tolerate from this house.
I am capable of experiencing the whole range of emotions while testing fragrances.
The fact that I was frustrated, means that I always approach new fragrance with a genuine hope that it's going to be at least good, I never give up on the perfumery, I am relentlessly optimistic.
Also I am impartial to Chloe brand. So, in frustration, I have left my card with ”indolic” written on it to rest.
Next day-the same, second and third day-the same smell from the card.
In about 5 days everything was gone, but not everything. Wait, is this ...creamy lilac or am I hallucinating?
This ending is so unexpected and pleasant: it’s creamy, slightly nutty lilac, redolent of Champs Elysees, but better.
Now, I am interested to know more. It's time for a skin test. Interesting how long would it take for indolic to go away to give way to lilac. I am hopeful and will update my review.
Give a balloon here to takeasniff since she so aptly gives the image of Chloe woman. Description perfectly matches my personality. In fact when reading reviews for Chloe by Chloe EDP I had experienced a strange feeling that reviewers knew me somehow. Yes, all of us could, probably, be assigned to certain type. But discovering new habits sometimes nice too.",07/31/13 15:50,RugosaAlba

It's very green and sour smelling settling into a powdery oriental. This is for the older woman out of all the other Chloe's as it has that sharpness and bitterness, i also believe the green feel adds to the maturity. I dislike it compare to the Chloe original EDP & EDT which i've had i wouldn't buy this one though as i believe it is too mature. For women 30+",07/19/13 11:48,polkadot27
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,very beautiful fragrance but poor longevity and sillage. you need to carry it in your bag and spray it every 2-3 hours. it does smell very nice and fresh on hair. it's ideal for summer,07/14/13 13:03,moongoddess
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"L'Eau de Chloe - is just one beatiful piece of creation. First spray is quite strong smelling of bitter grass, bitter lemon, cedar and everything green - almost toxic, can't say in a better or worse way. There are days I just love the opening of it and there are days I can't make myself.

Leaving this for a while it beautifully develops into mild floral-soapy scent still patchouli being the essence of it. Originally when I tried to sniff the bottle first before spraying I thought this was Chloe Eau de parfum minus all the sweetness of roses and litchi.

However, the sweetness and depth of patchouli and amber remind you about them in a couple of hours. The sillage is quite good and stays on my skin for quite a long while and develops in a sophisticated manner. I love those fragrances that are not linear and can change and make your mood change with them too. <3 :)",07/07/13 05:00,r4elle

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I was introduced to this fragrance by a SA who said she had a new fragrance very similar to Chanel no 19. Intrigued, I offered my wrist, and naturally the smell had nothing to do with my beloved no 19. But while I was driving home I started getting a soothing floral note, and it felt like a psychological massage to my tired and aching muscles.

I couldn't get l'eau de Chloe out of my mind and a week later I bought a bottle. I felt a fondness for the smell that I couldn't initially understand, but then I remembered what it was reminding me of. Years back, when my face had a particularly bad bout of dryness, I had taken to dabbing rosewater liberally over my face every evening. The rosewater offered relief from the stretching sensation in my skin, and had such a lovelyy, soft scent. L'eau de Chloe has that same smell. Now I feel I'm welcoming an old friend back.

To be honest, the rosewater is the only note I manage to get from beginning to end, but I am not complaining. I usually leave it for evenings at home, when I need to tone down after a hectic day. It soothes my nerves beautifully, and then,when I get into bed, I place my wrist near the pillow and this darling perfume lulls me to sleep.

And all this thanks to a misguided SA.",05/19/13 12:30,no5forever2

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I have come to the conclusion that this house is not for me. All of these perfumes give me images of a girl or women who is very feminine, pretty, sophisticated, intelligent doesn't swear wears pale pink, beige and frosted tones never wears gaudy jewellery or sporty clothes speaks softly has never died or coloured her hair never laughs too loud etc. Most things I am not!!:)

Obviously I am sure many ranges of women wear and like these perfumes I don't suggest women who wear this have no personality but this is the feeling I get whenever I test them I feel like a leash has been put on me and I am being told to sit down and be quite and act like a lady. I just can't get excited let alone spend the amount of money they usually sell for here in Australia. Normally I don't worry about image with a perfume if I like it I wear it but these ones just are so not what I am that I would smell and feel ridiculous wearing them.

They all with the exception of the older chloes which were very sweet and strong just end up smelling like shower products and nothing much else. They smell a little angelic which I am no angel! They are mild and very feminine.

I swear, I sometimes talk and laugh too loud, I am impulsive, I wear strong blues and blacks I can't stand beige and pink etc I have black coloured hair I don't mince words I am not reserved and polite I am just not able to sit comfortably with these. They do last very well the bottles are lovely I don't think Chloe spends too much time on bottles and they would be nice for a bride or a funeral or wedding, working with kids or hospitals etc but for me I am going to have to pass its like my arm suddenly becomes limp and I cannot even bring myself to spray them on and if I do I just fantasize about having a shower to a disturbing level so all in all not for me.",04/22/13 17:26,takeasniff
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I have this fragrance for the first day - I bought it very impulsively, more based on my expectations according to what the advertisement represented: lightness, freshness, something cheerful, associated with spring and first flowers and leaves on the trees...

What a different smell: as mentioned already, first thought of mine was: ,,This smells like an aunt in her seventies."" Not youthful. There is something old in this fragrance. Definitely there is no young girl or summer breeze as in the picture represented the fragrance (although we can still consider the presence of springtime here)

A bit of dissapointment. I will give it a try, though.


NOTE: After few hours (maybe 3) the scent really smells lovely on the skin: more tender, lighter, more warm, sunny. I am not able to identify the ingredients, the citrus smell stays here as a soft dominant, but the ,,old aunt"" feeling is gone. Very nice surprise! Obviously one of the fragrances where one has to wait a bit to let the tones develop!

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"After falling in complete love for this fragrance via a sample , a very lovely member gifted a bottle of this scent to me. :D
To me , an extremely green and fresh patchouli, ( as if a patchouli leaf was pinched while still growing on the plant itself ) earthy and alive - not a deep incense-y herbal whatsoever.
The rose is spicy , equally as the patchouli, more of a living rose.
I detect lime, verbena, a faint touch of lemon.
Natural, not synthetic.
I adore this combination. I will definitely be wearing L'Eau de Chloe all of the warm months and into the fall . Probably winter months as well ;)
It has class and is elegant, but not above being able to wear casually.
Edit : This does go on very strong, on me. I go lightly with my spritz.
The longevity for me has been 10+ hours. I have worn all day at work ( up to a 10 hour work day and had applied a half hour before leaving the house ) , and once to bed. I could detect it, and was surrounded be the fragrance the entire time. I am not sure how far the sillage had reached.",04/05/13 13:16,MeanSuga
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I AM OBSESSED WITH THIS SCENT. It is my favorite of all the Chloe perfumes (I love all of them, though). To me, this screams rose water - a very natural, delicate scent. The citrus brightens up the rose water, and the patchouli deepens it. The end result is a deliciously sunny and elegant scent, something that reminds me of tea roses, lemonade, soap, clean linens, and outdoor greenery. Fortunately on me this scent lasts all day, even if it stays close to the skin. I have a feeling I am going to wear this every day for a long time because this scent makes me so happy. I am surprised by how this smells absolutely nothing like Chloe EDP.

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,lighter/summer version of Soir de Lune,03/18/13 23:25,Momo Tse
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"A retro throwback based on the original Chloe rose EDP covered with a thick layer of patchouli. I do not get any citrus. The well familiar rose takes on the middle, embelished by moss, sandalwood and a little less patch in the drydown. It goes through the same stages as the original - sharp, then watery/flowery and slightly soapy at the end.
A lot of people call the original outdated (there's a generous amount of grandma and old lady depictions thrown around in the reviews)...well I wonder how this EDT was spared from these qualifications? L'eau is a lot more outdated to my nose. My grandmother actually wore something very similar decades ago, I still remember her scarves and brown everlasting leather purse smelled like rose oil, patchouli and sandalwood.
I tried to like L'eau but it just does not work, when it comes to personal preferences. This edition of Chloe strikes the type of patchouli I loathe the most. Thank god I can enjoy the other flankers, even though they never seem to have made their way into my perfume collection after I used up the samples.",03/01/13 09:55,LuluCoconut

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"When I first bought it I really liked it and I used it a couple of times, then I started to get headaches and nausea from it. I just couldn't stand this perfume. I would get instant throw up feeling from sniffing it. Just too much rose I think. There is sooo many rosesmells I can't handle, and this is no.1 on the list. I had to give it to my mom who really liked it, but I still couldn't stand the smell, so I couldn't get near her for a while. Worst perfume experience ever.",02/22/13 11:38,johanna.lindholm

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Opens up very citrusy, with a distinct note of lime. The first 10 minutes of this is fizzy, sparkly, green, slightly herbal and minty, and very uplifting. Then the top notes begin to fade and the floral notes slowly emerge. Eventually this dries down to pure powder. A hint of rose is present, but I wouldn't even call this a rose-based perfume. I would never guess there is patchouli in here, I can't smell it at all. Overall, I would call this slightly floral and VERY powdery.",02/04/13 06:46,Radchick
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"yes, this is a beautiful perfume but i 've dissapointed.
when i first tested it at paper, it is very citrusy fresh and rose makes me feel good. so i had perchase it.
but i tested it my skin, citrus quickly gone just left lukewarm rose smell so i can't get any freshness. then there' s nothing different with original!
it's not good on my skin. even it makes me wondered i was bought a knock-off. i need more citrus! my bad...",01/29/13 15:25,HUEbris
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"I was surprised to see that this perfume contained rose and patchouli. Michel Almairac has done an amazing job combining the notes in such a way so that the patchouli and rose are NOT synthetic, cheap and old lady like. This scent is very distinct and long lasting. 1 hr after washing it off I can still smell it.

Impressions of the perfume: spring, fresh, happy, sunshine, new clothes.

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"Fresh clean and energizing in the most comfortable way possible if that makes any sense.
I really like this one. I think i enjoy it more than the original Chloe.
This is a nice fresh Spring or Summer scent that i feel would be safe for work.
Its almost like this scent was made to put the person wearing it in a happy and confident mood.
I would repurchase this for sure as its not generic smelling like many perfumes these days.
I like the touch that the Patchouli leaves in this perfume and i also think that the color of the perfume and the ribbon around the cap are a very good match to the scent.
Great job on this flanker Chloe :)",12/22/12 16:27,Lushylori
L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"One to test on your skin. If your chemistry is anything like mine, this is gorgeous!

It is a fresh citrus in the opening and the dry down is very clean and soapy with a touch of soft patchouli, in a very pleasant way. usually i never go for fresh scents like these but this one is definitely an exception. it is very inoffensive and definitely not in your face.

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"This is an odd one because to me it smells like bathroom cleaning products, but I love it! Something about it just makes me really happy.

I didn't get the soapy or spicy...more a soft floriental.

L'Eau de Chloe Chloé,"my soon-to-be mother-in-law just bought this one for her&her daughter, so i had an opportunity to test it not only on my own skin, but theirs as well.

to be honest - i can't stand it.
it's this kind of scent that may not be pleasant for every one.
i love other chloe's - also chloe,love ones, even though they're not truly meant for me.
but this one is another story. it's fresh and a little sweet at the beginning, which is nice, because it's the best at first sniff.
then it becomes iritating, sharp, almost like after a short walk through a garden full of lemon and flowers you come in to some dark, dusty place filled with herbs and spiciness. it's also soapy and powdery at the same time.

couldn't stand it so hard i had to wash it off, and i even couldn't stand next to my sister-in-law for a longer time, because i didn't like the scent.

not what i expected, definitely. lemonade and rose are great, but are hardly there.",08/15/12 13:25,cherie97

Violette Chloé,"I've been reading the reviews with interest as I have the Iris version of Chloe, which I adore.
Unfortunately, it is out of stock in NZ at the moment and I thought the Violette may be a good replacement.
I'm wondering why no one has mentioned the Iris one as similar, as to me it is the most powdery violet I have tried in many years? Does anyone have both the Violette and the Iris?",11/10/25 14:34,pirini.covich
Violette Chloé,"Dainty Fairy.

This is an interesting one. It took me a few wears to really appreciate it. I found it almost childish in the opening, but it does settle into a powdery violet. It's unlike any other violet soliflore I have, and I have a bunch!
After a week of owning this, I crave it constantly. It's so easy to wear, so dainty, so carefree and light. I really love all the Atelier des Fleurs but this is easily one of my favorites....the other being Orchidée de Minuit.",10/21/25 17:00,chiqpea
Violette Chloé,"I am a lover of photorealistic soliflores or floral fragrances that showcase a realistic floral with just a few other supporting notes. I was in the market for my first violet perfume and debating between Annick Goutal’s La Violette and this. Surprisingly, I couldn’t find anyone comparing the two. I got a sample of the Goutal. It smells just like Canal’s violet chewing gum—sweet, tart, candied, mouthwatering, girly. I like that one a lot, but was hoping for something that felt a little less candy-like, a little more sophisticated to my taste, since I can only buy one violet fragrance for now. Unfortunately, samples of the Atelier des Fleurs line are hard to find or quite expensive, and Chloe’s Violette wasn’t available to try in my city. I don’t recommend blind-buying, but I felt pretty sure this would be to my taste based on the reviews I could find. It worked out—this fragrance is feminine, soft, realistic, skin-scent violet, but less candy-like than the Goutal. It has just a tad of powder, which feels airy rather than heavy or dusty. The scent feels youthful, fairylike. If you want a violet that is another step less girly, you might try Hermes’s Violette Volynka, which has a leather note and feels more “serious.”

The violet note comes and goes, as violet does, so sometimes you get a whiff of the whole scent and sometimes you get a whiff of the light powdery base on its own. Someone did mention layering the Chloe and the Goutal together. I expect that would be lovely.

I purchased my bottle from a reputable grey market seller; it is three years old by the batch code.",07/09/25 15:11,starbit
Violette Chloé,"There is some citrusy note at the opening. It makes it refreshing and light. I like this interpretation of violet, however it lasts maybe 30 minutes on my skin. Such a pity at this price point.",06/13/25 19:25,eva.daisy.88
Violette Chloé,"This fragrance is pure poetry. A soft violet breeze from a memory you didn’t know you missed until it wrapped itself around you. Violette by Chloé is delicacy in a bottle … elegant, whispery, and timeless. It smells like a hidden garden in early spring, the kind where the sun glows gently and the world feels like it’s holding its breath.

This isn’t your loud, dramatic floral. No. This is grace. A powdery-soft cloud of violets that clings to skin like silk. It has that vintage charm but never feels dated … just romantic, like an old letter tied with a ribbon. You wear this when you want to feel calm, grounded, and utterly feminine in the most natural way.

I’m honestly in love with the Atelier des Fleurs collection by Chloé. Every scent feels like a tribute to a single flower, letting it shine in its purest, most beautiful form. And Violette? She’s the shy star, the soft-spoken sister who leaves an unforgettable impression.

Wearing it feels like being hugged by a memory. I don’t just recommend this 💜 I treasure it.

Violette Chloé,"Opens with a funky citrus zing, making me wonder if this violet was somehow left out in the sun to sweat. But that thankfully quickly settles into a buttery, musky violet, draped in soft, leafy freshness. It’s got a faint pat of sweet, powdery makeup, maybe a light and airy, soft blush. Sort of the type that lingers as fairy dust on pretty compacts and silk scarves. Violette is not overly floral, not too sweet, starring just a cozy, plush violet in its full simplicity. If violets had skin, this is what I'd imagine they’d probably smell like.",02/02/25 21:33,luvoxlixir
Violette Chloé,"Absolutely in love with this. It has a decent longevity and I can smell it all day round. It reminds me of running through a field of violets in summer as a kid, the sun is shining, you are barefoot and you can feel the wind blowing through your hair, all you can hear is laughter and birds. The violets are so fresh and photo-realistic but also somewhat candied which makes it even more nostalgic.",10/21/24 06:04,Jtaimeniche
Violette Chloé,"I love violet. It's one of my favorite notes and perfumes that feature it as a note are usually an instant love. Violets unfortunately have scent molecules that cause you to go anosmic for a brief while to the aroma which gives most violet-forward perfumes notoriously terrible longevity. That being said, I went into this expecting poor longevity. I was not prepared for how poor it would be.

The scent is an absolutely perfect violet. It's a really jammy, fruity-sweet violet with good amounts of sharp powder. I loved it and immediately it sat close to the skin (so basically 0 sillage). I was willing to be ok with that, and even ok with the price tag, because I love violet scents that much. However the longevity is basically 15 minutes; I'm not even joking. I sprayed it on the back of my arm then just walked around the store and waited in line to purchase something and I went to sniff the back of my arm again and it had the faintest ghost of a scent. Heartbreak.

As a scent, it's perfect for daytime, spring or summer. It has a charming, timeless innocence about it. It brings to mind the image of wearing a long white cotton dress and bare feet on the grass. It's lovely but at this price point for this performance it's essentially useless. A 10/10 scent, but basically a 2/10 experience.",06/11/24 13:02,parfumparfan

Violette Chloé,"I am on a constant search for a perfect violet following the sad demise of Penhaligons Violetta, and my second love Santa Maria Novella's Violetta. I had hoped that Chloe Violette would deliver what I am longing for, but sadly for me it does not. It is a beautiful scent, and it smells natural and expensive (which it is), but I don't even get a hint of violet flowers from it. To me it has a pepperiness reminiscent of nasturtium, perhaps this is the violet leaf extract coming through. But where are the flowers? Not in this bottle, not for me. However, I have layered it with Goutal La Violette and this is a big improvement to both fragrances. I turned to Goutal's La Violette after Penhaligons discountinued Violetta, and although I like it and it is OK as a stand-in, it has too much rose for me and lacks the green notes of Penhaligons' Violetta: but layered with Chloe Violette's peppery greenness, together they transport me to the springtime woods. It's an expensive combination, but for me it is worth it (unless Penhaligons re-release my all time favourite).",04/08/24 03:19,Spellbound27

Violette Chloé,"I find Violette an ethereal fragrance, as if you went outside and surprise, the breeze brings the scent of some violets to you. You're not even sure where exactly they are growing, but now you want to go look for them.

It does have a lightly powdery phase but mostly it's gently fresh. It is also not especially green, nor is it musky. This is a completely inoffensive fragrance that could be worn anywhere. I wore it yesterday also and it wafted up at me for hours, but didn't project much. My husband also liked it on himself.

Of all my violet fragrances past and present, this is the least assertive, and the most like what I imagine the living fragranced violet flowers to smell like (the little violets that dot my lawn have no fragrance).

I have 30mls of a 90ml bottle remaining and I'm just having to use it sparingly and I'm not a 1 or 2 measly sprays type of woman but l know once this is gone its gone from my life forever so I'm holding on for dear life.
I wore this to work one day sprayed liberally of course as l didnt want to waste my more expensive special ones for work, and oh my gosh for the first time it struck me, what's that amazing clean powdery but soapy fresh and classy smell? I thought it was someone else wearing something great and after sniffing myself realised it was me!!
I'm not going to bore on about each note you can see what's in it on here above but this stuff is- just got out of a huge marble bubble bath, having used obscenely expensive French soap and powdered yourself in something wonderful and soft, and perfumed yourself with something gorgeous and expensive, and putting on a soft white cashmere jumper and all the fragrances are mingling into this amazing scent.
Oh my gosh why didn't l buy 5 bottles when l saw it on sale for £21 and bought this as a cheap and cheerful wear to preserve the time l have left with my expensive ones? I'm so upset l wasted it. 😞 😢 😭 Finding a bottle of this now is equivalent to finding the holy grail it's near enough impossible.
Funny story when l was a little girl of about 5years old l would sneak a little use of my mummy's expensive grown up lady perfumes. She had all the Diors and Chanels and Estee Lauders and l would put on her perfume & her pearls and bracelets & fox fur coat and high heels and Dior makeup, and pretend to be a fancy lady going out to dinner. One time she had an enormous bottle of Chloe and it wasn't a spray it was about 200mls and full and it had a big fancy clouded glass decorative sculpture stopper in it. Of course l dropped it and 80% spilled out all over the carpet. In panic mode because l knew l wasn't supposed to be messing with her things l filled the rest of the bottle of perfume up with water and it all went white and cloudy. I heard her coming upstairs and put it back on the dressing table and went and hid. 😆 Well needless to say l heard her screaming for me then, and that was one of the biggest hidings l ever got in my childhood! Its been referred to ever since as the Chloe beating! We laugh about it now, l deserved it. (Relax everyone it was 1980 a time when even the neighbours and friends of the family were allowed to beat you if they saw you misbehaving outside and your parents were grateful to them for doing it, and then they would beat you for giving someone else cause to do it!) 😆🤣 Anyway love this perfume even though its lure got me in a lot of trouble once.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"I just found a vintage EDT bottle from mid 90's, with very little left in it. The juice is dark in color, there is no writing on the bottle and on the bottom, it says that it was made in the USA.
I don't know what I have, is it the original version from the 70's which was still made in the 90's, or was there a reformulation in the 90's?
I remember (not very proudly) that at the time, I used to buy frags that had gifts with purchase (large duffle/weekend/tote bags, makeup bags, miniature perfumes or matching soap/body lotion/shower gel), and it was mostly scents that I didn't like.
Chloe was one of them so I gave it to my mom, she liked and used it.
I don't remember how it used to smell back in the day but I imagine that the juice turned.
It smells harsh, strong and vintage, more like my Magie Noir from '91 or Rumba by Ted Lapidus (I don't have the original Balenciaga). No fruit, coconut or anything juicy in this scent.",11/12/23 13:08,Chrisandra

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"Chloe, classic Chloe, used to be a soapy tuberose chypre, floral and green. My aunt wore this in the mid 1970's. After she visited I would go smell the sofa cushions where she sat because Chloe wafted from them. The new version is cheaper but still recognizable.

Even cheapened, Chloe is better than most new perfumes out there. I don't dislike modern perfumes. I just prefer structure and complexity typical of older fragrances. Once upon a time women wore beautiful, interesting, layered scents to present themselves as polished, chic, and stylish. Older perfumes just do more. Sometimes I like that.

And it's great to return to scents that are NOT influenced by La Vie Est Belle, Coco Mademoiselle, Baccarat Rouge 540, Angel, or Poison. Like listening to seventies music before auto tune and drum machines. Sometimes I like that.",07/02/23 16:54,Alces Alces

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"I have wanted to try Chloé for a long time, it being an oft-recommended vintage gem. I have a vintage miniature of Chloé, complete with lily-shaped lid, and the bright amber liquid is just as good as I'd hoped. It is quite similar to Balenciaga Michelle, an underrated 1970s floral that I reviewed recently, but Chloé is headier and less fresh up top, and more soapy overall.

Chloé opens with sweet, juicy peach, followed by sweet, heady florals. I get a lot of orange blossom, and sweet ylang ylang follows, lush and tropical. Coconut enhances the tropical creaminess. The aldehydes here are more soapy than bright, so much so that Chloé doesn't feel like an aldehydic floral scent in the manner of No. 5/Arpège etc., it feels more like a floriental with chypre facets.

As in Michelle, Poison-like tuberose features prominently as the floral heart emerges, lasting until the drydown. Powdery rose joins it, rounded out by clean jasmine, and some iris follows. Clove-like carnation adds spice.

Narcissus leads the drydown, polleny and grassy, and a lovely chypre-like mossiness emerges. Soft woody notes round it out, but it is mostly rich, sweet amber that makes up the base. It becomes musky as it fades, sweetly balsamic until final fade. Sillage is strong and longevity is long-lasting.

A huge yet cleverly balanced amber floral, this is complex yet cohesive. Evocative of its era, but still wearable today, it is extroverted femininity in a bottle. To be worn with confidence. 4/5.",02/18/23 09:16,Enrium

When I inevitably missed it and went to buy another bottle, I found it was discontinued!! Haven’t been able to justify the hefty price tag it now comes with just yet.

You're absolutely right.
The 'old lady smell' comes mainly from noses without an identity..Noses that have no sense of quality olfaction. Noses that didn't have the privilege to experience the magic of signature aromas that have a story of a decade to tell and continue to take us back to a time when there was a sense of meaning in life. Noses that are so narcissistic they can't imagine nor accept they'll ever get old.......
Nowadays, especially the poor millenniums, will grow older without having the privilege to learn what timeless perfume should be like-today, everything almost smells identical to each other, has that same heavy sweet smell that 'yells' for attention without deserving it.....

I didn't like Chloe when I first tried her. She didn't give me a headache or anything like that, I just thought it was too floral-y for my tastes. Like being a child and getting into your grandmother's perfume collection. My mom actually made a point to say I was wearing ""old lady perfume"" whenever I wore Chloe.
But now! I love her! Before everything shut down due to COVID I wore Chloe everywhere, to the grocery store, on the bus, to class, work, everywhere. Got a few compliments on it, but not enough to make it my all-time signature scent. Sometimes I'll use Chloe when I get out of the shower, as the scent seems a little out of season for the upcoming months. It's more of a spring/summer scent, rather than fall/winter.

The current version seems quite faithfull to what I remember of this scent. I have a feeling it really is discontinued now, even in drugstores and outlet, which forced me to order it. Let’s face it, I can’t see how it could sell anymore. It’s chemical, it’s super loud, it smells dated. And by the way not the best use of tuberose in my opinion. I love many old scents with tuberose like Loulou and Poison. But here, the peach / tuberose combo does not stand the test of time absolutely. Or maybe the reformulation is to blame? Maybe a vintage would be better for wearing. The original Karl Lagerfeld pour homme in its current formulation suffers from the same issues as this one.

When I bought this recently, I realized that it is not quite the same as the earlier Lagerfeld version. That one was sweeter, softer and deeper at the same time I think. And I got that as the first Christmas gift perfume I recieved from my husband, in 1983 - I was so happy, and he was so happy too, to be able to give it to me, since we were quite poor back then!

I had a couple of bottles of that first version, and the third time I got it, it was this newer version in the oval bottle. But I did not realize then, that it was reformulated. Or was it not? This was around 2000 I think.
But when I recieved the bottle I have now, I got a little bit disappointed, because now it is definitely reformulated.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"I really liked this back in the 80s, so when I recently purchased a set of four minis (in an effort to build up my stock of original Organza Indecence, which is why I purchased it), I was looking forward to trying it again. What I remembered the most about it was the peach note, not having the nose or knowledge to identify any other notes. Of course, the opening is off, but as a lover of many vintage perfumes, I knew not to pass judgment until it had a chance to settle down. Once it did, I immediately recognized the tuberose, and was happy to have even a mini, which is labeled as Parfum, with Parfums International listed as the distributor. Does it strike me as particularly sophisticated? No, not really. Do I think it is pretty in a loud white floral sort of way? Yes, definitely. Fortunately, I love this type of sweet, nectary peach and tuberose. Can I see why it would give many perfumistas a headache? Absolutely. But I love it for what it is - a heavy explosion of sweetened tuberose that now comes to me full of znostalgia from a time when I didn't care about the art of perfumery. I just knew what I thought smelled good, and that was more than enough for me! I still love it!
PS - those who remember this being in drug stores as teens in the 70s must have had some very high end drug stores, or Chloe must have decided to aim for more exalted ground in the 80s!

When the formula was first created it was not a cheap scent at all and sold in nice department stores. Later on it was found in drug stores, and still is . It has been around since 1975 ! There are good reasons it still sells - it is a tribute to classic femininity created by esteemed designer, Karl Lagerfeld ( recently deceased ). This smells like femininity in a bottle . It is not an overtly sexy scent , but it it is sexy in a soft and alluring form that does not conjure up images of stiletto heels .

Chloe has been reformulated and I still like it , but notice some missing notes and it is less complex and intense these days . Even in the reformulated state it is still quite pretty and a huge seller for almost 50 years . Recently I stumbled on to another perfume that is a dupe of the original that seems closer to the 1980s version I wore. It is called “Hawaii” by Milton Lloyd and is extremely inexpensive . If you like this kind of scent, check out Hawaii which is more complex and richer . Chloe and Hawaii are probably the two perfumes I would choose as my favorites of all times .

Recently I smelled Chloe at a discount store, and it smelled cheap. A strong alcohol blast on first spray leading to a suffocating tuberose and syrupy peachy notes. To me this fragrance was always heavy, especially since I was into light airy florals at the time, but I never remember it smelling like this. Now it was sweet like so many fragrances are today. What a difference time has made in fragrance geared towards the young. Today, candy is being marketed as scent. Sweet fragrances were part of the toy make-up kits we played with when we were children. Is the sweet perfume craze a reflection of level of maturity today? I don't know, but I often wonder if we were offered the sweet scents of today back then, would they have been as popular?",01/11/19 03:39,Anamandy

I don't find this overly sweet—definitely not a syrupy sweet like, say, Amarige or Chloé Narcisse. I can smell the flowers, but the aldehydes, oakmoss, and carnation give it a peppery green edge.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"annxyz - SO true. I cannot improve on your review. This is lovely, the tuberose is so warm and cozy and sexy in a low key way. Very well blended. I would say this is more of a fall/winter perfume. This one is a classic.
Edit: Cooler weather here and again, I find myself reaching for this classic. The tuberose in this is wonderful and warm.
Edit:I have verified that Coty has discontinued this. It does not fit in with their brand and current perfumes trends. Sad. You would think something that is popular since 1975 would get a pass, but no :(",09/13/18 16:41,felicite34

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"This perfume says “woman “ . It is the ultimate feminine floral . I can not understand why it is not preferred over the new generic and over priced version. This has much more warmth and depth .

Some reviews call it “dated” . How so ? Because it does not smell like berry jam or marmalade ? There are many things that would be considered dated , like a John Constable or Renoir painting . Many of the most striking creations are found in museums and galleries and revered. Do we need to dismiss something because it has been around a while ? Is it to be disregarded because our mother wore it ?
There was a time when women were less inclined to strive to be the sexiest woman in the room . This is a perfume for a woman who has no need to be a vamp . She is comfortable with her own skin and her definition of femininity is not dependent on being like everyone else, nor on being sexually provocative .


I wore this as a young mother ( thirty years ago ) and my husband loved the way it smelled on me . I am a grandma now, and was prepared to purchase the “new “ Chloe while shopping with a good friend.

On me it was a beautiful spicy rose with a peppery note that im guessing was the carnation. Lasts AGES, couple of sprays and its there all day.

I was unpacking perfumes that I had boxed up from my days of working in the fragrance and cosmetics industry in the late 70’s and 80’s and I found my vintage Chloe perfume in the Lalique crystal bottle and it still smells divine!

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"I got a vintage Chloe, 50ml, like the above bottle but def a Lagerfeld box. At first I thought it was musty/soapy and powdery and I liked it fine... but you must try on skin!

On skin I get SWEET buttery tuberose and coconut. Damn, it really really smells like melted butter- lol! Sadly I don't get much moss (got more moss/greens on fabric from my first test) just very potent full tuberose/coconut in a very very nice sweet way. Opens with aldehydes too. I find it quite sweet, and reminds me of Chloe Narcisse in that way.

I wanted to get woody mossy musk but it never came. I will say, it stayed POTENT on my shirt, but the skin application which developed/changed more, disappeared rather quickly- which is probably why I didn't smell the base. Despite this being a vintage bottle, I found the skin lasting power to be disappointing. However, I was heavy handed and the shirt sillage was HUGE, but did stay linear in the middle notes. I put a squirt of Silences on my skin later that night thinking it would boost the moss/green drydown of Chloe, but it was AWFUL (lol) and the potent Chloe from my shirt took over easily in 5 minutes.

I went to ebay to check out how cheap a small bottle of the current formula cost... and... well... I found another vintage and bought it. Haha. The 3.0, 90% full FROSTED bottle this time. YAY! $20!

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"Enjoying this, my mother’s favorite, now that the weather is FINALLY warming up and feeling more like spring. A nice daytime fragrance, good for work if used sparingly.

The aldehydes in the beginning provide a sparkly-soapy clean, invigorating start, then I get hints of peach and coconut. The flowers arrive, but are over-arched by a creamy tuberose that dominates for the majority of the fragrance. It ends with a musky soft sweet tuberose with a faded sparkle of aldehydes.

It definitely has a classic vibe that I enjoy, but it doesn’t feel dated at all. The modern EDT I have is pretty strong for the first few hours, but softens down nicely after that. Perfectly serviceable, no complaints here.",04/23/18 14:16,Blueflowers

The coconut swings between the notes freely as i can detect it with allot of roses, narcissus, jasmines, carnation, oakmoss, sandalwood, ylang, and orange blossoms. I can detect lilac, musk, hiacynth, cedar, and orris.

This is a blend of floral sweet with coconut, and woods. I've see this in a local antique vintage shop and it ran out of stock quite fast, and now i just understood why it want out that easy and fast. Impressive",04/20/18 04:43,Q80

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"I really, really, really like this! This has the potential to become love. I have a thing for vintage or old school fragrances that standout from the infinite sea of sweeties lining modern shelves. However, they can't be ""too old school."" I'm picky. Some 70's and 80's fragrances are favorites for me but I struggle with finding a place to wear them so I just don't! lol My Poison and Paloma Picasso are like that. They collect dust because it's hard to wear them in the modern world despite their beauty. I want that standout vintage smell without feeling completely out of place wearing it today. Chloe fits the bill perfectly. It's timeless, though it hints gently at times gone by, and it just works!

The Aldehyde & Tuberose combo lend a ""classy classic"" feel to the fragrance. It is creamy. It's clean. It's not soft but it doesn't scream either. It has a certain balance that I really appreciate. Some reviewers say peach is prominent, but I don't get the peach and I'm glad. I don't typically love heavy peach. I will edit with any revelations after a few more wears but it's fantastic so far!

For me, this is the senorita version of Chanel no 5, how someone else said in a comment smells like luxurious french soap, I usually dislike heady pure florals like Organza, Anais Anais or 5th Avenue, but this is not that, it has something so alluring, sexy but aristocratic. it remembers you what it means to be a woman and why you should be proud to be. Deep, it's like the person who wears it has something, a secret or a way of seeing things you will never understand, but you cant stop trying and falling for her. The vintage vibe is subtle, just enough to make you get into the trap of melancholy of golden times/dolce vita period.

Chloe is a perfume I remember from the late 80's but it didn't appeal to me then. I wore Miss Dior original, Rochas Femme, Magie Noir, Opium, Cinnabar and Jolie Madame in my 20's so Chloe seemed a bit lacking in sophistication for me.

However I'm visiting vintage fragrances now I have the inclination to indulge. This one is a new version of the vintage, in the same bottle and packaging as shown at the top of the page. After wearing Chloe for a few hours now, I am enjoying the perfume. The aldehydes are clear as well as the florals and tuberose. I'm quite a tuberose aficionado these days and this one isn't tuberose heavy enough for me to want to buy another bottle in a hurry. But I will wear and enjoy it.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"I first had this is the mid to late 80's while attending college. I wore this and Anais Anais a lot. They were my intro to the big powerhouses of silage. Decades have passed, and I moved on from these to other styles.

However, I kept seeing this at TJMAXX, but always passed on it for years because I heard the reformulation was crap. Finally about 4 months ago, I saw a gift set with a damaged box for $14.99 for a large bottle and a giant lotion...what the hell, I'm going for it.

To be honest, it's just the way I remembered it. It doesn't smell different, and it's still quite strong. 2 sprays-7 hours, I retroactively say sorry to all my friends back in the 80's because I know I did much more than 2 sprays back in the day.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"Some might relate to this: the relationship I have with Chloe (this one- not the new stuff) is similar to a relationship one might have with a troublesome lover. Wearing it is like having a passionate torrid affair with someone who you know is all wrong for you, yet they keep drawing you in.

Chloe is a very lovely scent- certainly one of the all time greats- but it's so intense and animalic! Generally I gravitate towards fresh clean and fun fragrances; picks that are pleasant and easy to wear. Chloe is... sort of naughty. To be sure, it qualifies as a romantic scent. But it's the part of romance that happens after dinner at the fancy restaurant and the long evening stroll by the water. It's what happens when you get back to the hotel after all that. It smells like love, affection, a box of Valentine's Day chocolates, wet bedsheets and lingerie strewn over the chair. Yes, it's ""love"", but love in real-time; warts and all.

About 30 minutes later a beautiful aroma reached my nose and sticked with me throughout the evening (even after doing the dishes).

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"Recently bought a vintage, Lagerfeld version, from eBay. Mostly for sentimental purposes, as it was one of the fragrances my mother would wear (and I frequently stole from her medicine cabinet for a spritz) when I was a child.

This has all the elements I remember. On me, the peach is creamy and prominent and I blame this perfume for my peach obsession of today. Of course, it may also have something to do with my love of tuberose. We start early, right? There's something so satisfying about the round fruit-shaped frosted bottle with its silver cap.

I don't adore it as much as I used to - these days I prefer fewer aldehydes, something less big, less '80s-feeling - but I still reach for it when I'm feeling nostalgic. It's like the comfort food of fragrances for me.",09/24/17 12:29,DulciusExAsperis

Now this is a so peculiar perfume...in a good way. It stands out of the bunch and is a love or hate perfume. So...i love it. It opens with the most medicinal aldehydes followed straight away with the tuberose. The tuberose stays there while the aldehydes dissipate introducing the peach which is creamy. Don't forget about the moss. Is here in the backstage keeping all the notes interesting and saving them by become dull and another 70-80s perfume. This is the most spectacular of this frag. The oakmoss keeps all together and don't let them become sugary sweet. The drydown is very smooth because the sandalwood enters the game and stays that way till the end

I cant stand smelling like candy floss, or like every other person. I clearly remember the time when CK one was launched, and EVERYbody, men and women, were wearing the same thing. Went to the movies, and the whole theatre was CK one!

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"Wow. This perfume is amazing.

I was shopping at Marshall's with my mother this afternoon when she stopped to look at a box set of perfume and lotion. She looked at it and said, ""You know, I wore this for years right after I met your dad. Think he will still recognize the scent?"" Mind you, my parents have been married for over 30 years. So we buy the (very reasonably priced) box set and head home for a Father's Day celebration. She dabs on a bit of the lotion on our way.

After getting home she has my dad smell her wrists. ""Hey! I know this!"" He says. My mom's eyes light up. He remembered this after so many years.

On my way home from dinner I stopped back by Marshall's to pick up a set for myself. I didn't really pay attention to what the fragrance smelled like, but I wanted it just knowing it was special to my mom. I sprayed a bit on and started my drive home.

MY GOOD LORD. This stuff is great! Slightly suffocating when you first spray it on (it's harsh, y'all) but give it 15 minutes and you're surrounded in a halo of creamy, clean goodness. It's so hard to describe.. it's not too sweet, not too in-your-face and CERTAINLY not too old fashioned. I'm 25, for the record.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"I have the Chloe, Parfums Chloe version. Never smelled the Lagerfield version, unfortunately, so I cannot comment on that version. Not the Chloe New, either.

The Chloe I have is still wonderful. Completely different than anything being released lately. It is a heady, sensuous floral but the addition of the aldehydes keeps it from being syrupy and heavy. It is so beautiful. Warm but totally appropriate for summer wear. I was actually hoping it would be more powerful and have stronger sillage and projection.

This is immediately going into my Top 5 favorites.

UPDATE: Wow, what a beautiful scent. Dried down to a lovely, slightly soapy (think Ivory) floral. This really is perfect for summer. It may be a faux pas to mention this, but I'm getting a slight EL White Linen vibe (which I almost got, instead of the Chloe). I can also smell traces of what inspired Chloe Narcisse, which is a favorite of mine. This is NOT overpowering or a sillage monster. Now, I'm going to have to track down some vintage.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"This is another one I love, as it's another one of the few vintage perfumes that seem to suit my body chemistry.

It doesn't seem to be too sweet, or overpowering (if used in small doses) on me.

It's just sweet enough and a little spicy.

Almost edible, especially once the flowers fade a little - but, definitely not in that sickly, artificial candy type way many contemporary perfumes have.

It's very far from that.

It's more like a spiced fruit dessert.

Almost Christmasy, even.

I also happen to really like the Chloe fashion house; so, it's kind of like it was meant to be.

When I was a little girl, my mum didn't like Chloe very much.

Whereas vintage perfumes tend to go sour on me, they tended to go overly sweet on her.

So, it's totally understandable that she would have considered Chloe a no-no for her.

She said she didn't like musk very much and it is fairly musky, I guess?

Also, she had more of a stylish, but slightly androgynous vibe, which didn't really gel with the whole ""Chloe girl"" look.

Whereas, as a little girl, I was really into feminine stuff.

I remember standing in Boots with her and being very drawn to the beautiful, calla lily bottles and the sweet, heady smell.

I even liked the soft shape of the letters, saying ""Chloe"" and the accent over the e.

I remember I pointed over at the Chloe counter and said ""What about Chloe?"".

She said ""Chloe?! No."", very firmly and scoffed slightly, at the very idea. xD

I'm sure I saw the Chloe sales assistant, who was looking over at us, smile at me somewhat sympathetically, lol.

Looking back, it was quite funny.

Anyway, gorgeous, slightly sultry, feminine fragrance, as long as it suits your body chemistry.

I haven't tried the new version, by the way - I'm mainly referring to old vintage bottles of the pure parfum, in the little glass-stoppered bottles.

Those bottles are so beautiful.

Wish there were still bottles (and perfumes) like that, now.

Imagine a little bottle like this, with a frosted, graduated, light dusty pink orchid stopper, for example.

But, I digress...",04/12/17 20:12,chloeh
Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"Since my first review, I've added a small bottle of the vintage pure parfum to my collection. It's a beautiful heavy floral perfume. Tuberose is the top note, and it's very rich and heady. I don't get the sharpness of the EDT in the pure parfum.

The amber, sandalwood and benzoin drydown is sumptuous despite it is in the vintage EDT concentrate.

Chloe is deep, comforting and warm and it wraps you up in a tuberose blanket. I find that the base notes of ambery, tuberose deliciousness are more like the top notes with a hint of peach on top but it starts out with a burst of powdery white flowers and aldehydes.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"I never really appreciated this beauty when I had it at the end of the 80s, I rarely wore it and I've been ignoring it ever since;I'd dismissed it as an old fashioned heavy floral. I have the little round glass bottle parfum version with the glass lily stopper in its ever so slightly worn-looking box, the 9.5ml Parfum in a silver canister which comes with a funnel & soft cloth holder in a stiff box, a splash and a spray version - a lot of juice for something I rarely wore!! I re-tried the pure parfum first & the first sniff on the stopper didn't smell too promising; maybe a bit sharp and nothing like I remembered but I persevered anyway and oh! what a treat! On my skin the coconut smells almost vanilla-like, it is rich and amazing, it stays pretty much the same after the opening notes have faded after a few minutes.There is nothing sharp here, just smoothness and warmth. I wore it to work and was virtually wrestled to the ground by a work colleague who couldn't stop sniffing me and my 16 year old son adores it. On a personal note, it takes me back to being a teenager, full of hope for the future & it reminds me of a friend who used to love it who is no longer here and mostly it makes me feel happy, calm and at peace - the power of perfume. I'm going to wear it more often now, the edt versions work really well in warmer weather.I'll check out the newer version as well but I'd recommend trying the Karl Lagerfeld original, it is truly beautiful, even for a non floral lover like me.",09/14/16 04:42,thedivinemrsmiggins

Late 80’s, early 90’s, I had all three of these beauties in my perfume stable, but Chloe was my go-to scent. I loved it, so it was very disappointing when they reformulated this. It appears that the old version is back though, or as close to it as I remember it, so I purchased a bottle of the new EDT for old time’s sake. It’s lighter and not as rich as I remember – the vintage version seemed so lush and sumptuous when you sprayed it on. It would settle around in you a beautiful, warm cloud and the staying power was incredible. That said, this most recent reincarnation is certainly better than the first reformulation I tried, which was nothing like the original. Why, oh why, do perfumers do this? It was a classic, dammit – a classic! Still, this is lovely. Dali for Women, by Salvador Dali, reminds me of the original Chloe, but the Dali is spicier, while the Chloe is sweeter. It’s still gorgeous, but I’m going to keep my eyes peeled for the vintage stuff.

It's not too fruity but just enough for me. The flowers are not many but they are fragrant and make a statement. There's Queen Jasmine, in all her glory, a real Indian jasmine, with unapologetic aroma that hits your nose. Smells like a beautiful Hindu priestess. There's also carnation flowers and roses. The darker scents of sandalwood, woods, musk and incense are also here, giving this body a full body and a complexity. Beautiful. I can't believe I had never checked out this perfume. It smells like a million bucks but it's a cheapie, so get it while it's still selling and I hope to God it is never discontinued.

Base Notes: Sandalwood Amber Musk Benzoin Oak Moss Cedar Wood

Chloe! So how've you've been? It's been a long time.

Let me tell you what Chloe did for me. I refer to the vintage 1975 Chloe. That was the fragrance I was familiar with when it was still selling before the reformulation. I went to every job interview as an 18 year old fresh out of high school girl wearing this perfume. At the time I thought it was the most divine, ""grown up"" and classy fragrance of my life. I clung to this perfume like my life depended on it. My boyfriend at the time was Manny a boorish but loveable Brooklyn bad boy car mechanic slash high school football player, who absolutely hated this perfume that he compared to ""old women's soap"". Lucky for me I was too busy to even think about what he meant by such nonsense. I got the jobs I wanted wearing this perfume. It always did the trick. So did Classique by Gaultier which Manny really liked but which I wore for ""comfort"" and not for ""social climbing"". Chloe was the perfume I strongly believed opened doors for me as a young woman in Manhattan NYC. Chloe was like a magic invisible woman who was always with me helping me out. She was my perfume fairy god mother. She always received compliments. Older women looked at me like like I was one of them. At the time I wanted the respect of my elders including my professors. Older men always checked me out when I wore this perfume with my outfits. Mothers who were going out with their kids always looked at me like I was taking on too much too soon. This frag was my first true entry into adulthood.

Chloe is a classic floral chypre. It opens with perfumy aldehydes. Now if you have no problem with aldehydes in fragrances this should be easy for you to wear. If not, look elsewhere for perfumes that do not contain aldehydes. This is an aldehydic scent as it opens. It's the aldehydes we have come to enjoy in classic vintage masterpieces like Chanel No. 5, Arpege by Lanvin, Chanel No. 22, White Shoulders by Evyan and First by Van Cleef and Arpels. The sparkling refreshing aldehydes are what makes this frag ultra feminine, for women only. Emphasis on women, not 15 year olds. The fragrance then turns into a fruit concentrated scent of peaches and coconut. The coconut is rather heavy and becomes milky sweet and tropical. It has a touch of the exotic with a tropical paradise type of vibe. Then it gets into it's floral heart. I smelled rose, carnation, jasmine, tuberose and lilac. The honeysuckle is also rather heavy to the point it's a floral honeysuckle and fruit type of frag. It's sweet but not cloying. Out of the depths of the base notes there's something that sort of turns into a honey. It's also like caramel. It becomes an unusual early gourmand fragrance before the gourmands ever arrived in the perfume universe and surprisingly without containing gourmand notes. The caramelized amber is at work. It's a dark and delicious amber perfume. The base is also rather woodsy and that sandalwood makes this frag into a chypre. There's oak moss and sandalwood which for me always make frags winners. The only thing missing was musk, but without musk the whole thing is more feminine. It's floral, fruited and woodsy. It has a long life and she's with you the whole day so you better like Chloe because she accompanies you to the doctor's appointment, to lunch with friends, to children's soccer games, to PTA meetings, to dinner dates, to the movies, to trysts with lovers, to any place you take her to.

Chloe and I are still together.

I think bout the women who wore this in the 70's. I can see the same woman who wears Fidji by La Roche Aliage by Estee Lauder or Chanel No. 19 wearing this. This is just as much a chypre because of the woods but it's not as green. It's more floral. The amber is what really make this perfume magical to me. The flowers are to die for, the coconut is nice if you don't mind it, and the aldehydes are the icing on the cake. I think of successful, hard working feminist women wearing this perfume, 1970's women who put their careers first before any other element in their life. I thihk of Marlo Thomas in That Girl or Mary Tyler Moore. This is a gorgeous grown up perfume for the woman who believes in herself. Chloe believes in you too.",06/19/16 00:50,Gigi The Fashionista
Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"I got my long-awaited sample of vintage Chloe today, only to discover it is much softer and more mannerly than I would have supposed. Within minutes it dried down to a mellow floral blend that reminded me of Lilac and peach blossom. I could still smell the hints of more complex florals, and the nice woody, mossy base, but only as the merest suggestion. I was expecting more drama and risk with the narcissus and tuberose. A very pleasant, enjoyable scent, just not the classic powerhouse I was hoping for. Perhaps I can wear it on days I'm feeling subtle and mannerly. There hasn't been one yet, but you never know...

A note: Don't get this confused with the new ""Women's Chloe"" in the pale pink, fluted bottle - it is NOT the same thing at all. Fragrantica has a whole different listing for it as ""Chloe Eau de Parfum/Toillette."" They don't smell anything alike, except that they're both faintly sweet smells. But then, so is antifreeze. Just saying. The formula listed here is long obsolete; it looks like there's a modern reformulation. Not sure of the quality.

Update: I realized belatedly I had the EdT version, which I've since learned are always nearly invisible on me. I need the strong stuff. An experience with the EdP has caused me to fall deeply, affectionately in love with this scent, and see its richness and addictive complexity. It's a classic for a reason!",05/04/16 15:20,EvesFolly

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"Vintage Chloe edt by Lagerfeld

I had this dream that I was trying to walk through this thick haze of aldehydes, orris root and aquanet, its stench was so overwhelming, I fainted to the ground.

As the haze of one of the roughest starts in perfumary began to dissapate, I come to my senses and see Karl Lagerfeld holding a giant tuberose stalk of flowers that smelled so thick, heady, buttery, oily , real-almost off putting but not-and he began to beat me into submission to worship at the alter of the man behind the fan. Tuberose, tuberose and more tuberose.

Little while later supermodels descended and sprinkled jasmine, peaches,hyacinths , carnations and honeysuckle all over me. I passed out again at the heady floral that reminded me of its rival at the time Anais Anais...

But Lagerfelds white floral was bigger, stronger, louder with brass. It was going to be beautifully noticed.

I finally woke up in a field of mossy , soft musk with honeysuckle still lilting in and out wondering what happened to me... I had met Chloe.",04/15/16 02:20,SuzanneS
Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"This review is for the Chloe currently available in 2016.

This fragrance is extremely old fashioned, and absolutely out of step with contemporary perfumery.
Which is not necessarily an entirely bad thing... ;-)

Probably the single most noticeable aspect of this powerful perfume is it's complexity. Compared to the sweet simplicity of mainstream perfume of the past few years, this is a wonderland of blending and harmonising, with many, many ingredients coaxed to show their best selves and meld into a vast, glorious symphony.

Whether you like it or not remains purely subjective, but wearing this is a complex, long lived, experience that you definitely share with those around you.

Despite having worn this (with a heavy hand, too, I suspect) as a teenager myself, I don't think this is an easy perfume for a younger woman to wear. It has a lot of presence, and a significant degree of sophistication about it.

I also am not too disturbed about the reformulation aspect of this perfume. I have a large bottle of the vintage and yes, it is different from that which you can buy now. But the modern interpretation is faithful to the original in spirit, and has simply tweaked some of the aspects of the perfume that are less acceptable to the modern nose. It's quite cleverly done, and the modern version still smells very recognisably like the old Chloe.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"A couple years ago I received this as a gift from a friend. My immediate thoughts were that this was too ""old"". As others note, its' aldehydic opening that resembles Chanels' No. 5 was quite off-putting.

Well I just pulled this fragrance back out as I'm trying to clean out my apartment and found that I don't completely despise it, as I used to. It continues to reside outside of my favorites and regular rotations, but it's also not the most disliked in my collection. Well, any longer.

It's a tad heavy, and very much reminds me of perfumes I associate with my elders. However it's kind of warm, powdery and comforting (if not overdone!).

It's a fragrance I'll use sporadically, perhaps when I feel like using something dissimilar to the rest of my collection, or have the desire to step a little out of character, but overall this is not quite to my liking.

I hadn't smelled it in many years but took a chance and bought a bottle at Marshall's yesterday. I got in the car and opened it and spritzed my wrist. Oh. My. Heavens. It was like I'd found my long lost soul mate. Not sure what that says for my skin or nose, since so many seem to find this one unpleasant, but just one spritz on my wrist put me in fragrance heaven. It is very similar to the Chloe Narcisse I've had but less intense. I really hate it for those who don't smell it like I do. But that happens both ways.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"I'd always expected this to smell differently. I think it's the dark amber tone of the juice. You expect lethally Pungent with an outdated ripe civet and black currant leaf urine smell.

It's a bit of a cult classic and can be had for a song so I decided to give it a try. I realize that it has been reformulated and in some instances, I'll go hunting for the vintage version but in this case, it just makes more sense to go for what's there.

I am pleasantly surprised. This is a light garden of white florals centered around the sweetly feminine stridency of tuberose. I've smelled this before during my childhood in the late 70s/early 80s but did not realize that I was smelling Chloe. The wood basenotes don't get in the way of the womanly florals and the soapy aldehydes prevent the scent from being cloying.

I will be wearing this in spring summer for a nice switch up from my usual florientals and chypres.


ETA: Maybe I'm a bit strange but all of these reviews calling this ""grandma"" and outdated. I think it smells sexy and very feminine. There is a reason why tuberose plants were considered taboo during the Victorian age----the scent was supposed to enhance the libido making men incapable of containing themselves. As such, young girls were not permitted to have them in their rooms or while accepting gentlemen callers. Hilarious! Tuberose in the days of old was considered so overtly sensual, that in historical diaries and literature it was at times referred to as the flower of whores. Tuberose and Jasmine were scandalous back in the day.



ETA: Came back to this review in a bit of a confused state. I am wearing this today in warm early Spring weather. I am confused because I don't understand how this perfume is not more popular. Actually, I suppose that I do. So much of perfume is subjective and dependent upon the marketing of the perfumer. People hear 1970s and automatically people are going to think musty and fusty. In reality, this is really awesome.

It's a honeysuckle, peach, tuberose aldehydic perfume with a definite layer of sweet crystallized sugar. Sugar cubes. It's white flowers on a bed of sugar cubes. Again, it's not cloying despite the sugary element, the aldehydes give it a triple milled soap quality--very clean and bright. I'm really falling in love and can say that I would likely include this in my personal fifteen absolutely necessary scents. It has all of the elements that are supposed to be popular today: sugar, check! White floral, check! Clean scent, check! Too weird that more people are not in love. Again...marketing seems to be everything.",02/17/16 11:34,Ferminadaza
Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"Tried as part of a Sephora sample box a coworker generously passed on to me - I'd previously sprayed my wrist at a department store and pretty much promptly forgot about it but this time, I sprayed the tiny spritzer on my chest/neck and WOW, what a difference! At first it was a very warm, weird, heavy cloud that I figured would dissipate as the day wore on but it morphed into a spicy pleasantness that kept making me wonder WHO I was smelling because it was SO different! And even now, almost 24 hours later, I can still catch it when I wave my pajama top around! This is one of those powerhouse scents for a woman who wants to smell as strong and unique as she is, which is to say, it's not for everybody.

To me,this Chloe It is nondescript, dull and fusty. It reminds me of an old cheap Avon ""perfume"" .

Considering it's composition, Chloe should be fresh, spicy, exciting and sassy. It is not. It reminds me of overripe peaches on the verge of going bad.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"Some departent stores are actively putting the classic Chloe out for test, and it's easy to see why. The scent is retro-fabulous! Its a warm, yellow floral (tuberose, I'm told,) that is pillowly soft, with a little bit of sweetness and touch of spice. With drier, more floral fragrances cycling back into vogue (my fellow Millienals have become adults!) the classic Chloe is the perfect ""sorry-not-sorry"" scent for the young woman who has made her peace with inevitably becomming her mother.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"Oh Chloe!!! I was about 7 or 8 years old when my Mom first purchased this in the late '70s. I can remember sitting in the bathroom watching her put on her makeup and teasing her hair, cigarette leaving a trace of nicotine on the edge of the sink, and her fussing that she forgot she left it there. Chloe cut through all of it: the hairspray, the cigarette smoke, the tobacco, the face powder. It was sweet and thick and bold. Mom wore IT. It did not wear HER. I was delighted when she bought it; I did not like the dark side of Emeraude and the other metallic powder dark scents she had worn through the years. This was bright and unique. She later went back to the powder dark side, and I don't think they suit her as well. I've tried Chloe several times and it's generally better for me in the summer when I'm a bit more sweaty and oily. But nothing as good as how it smelled on my Mom....",10/13/15 13:51,Scout
Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"In 1975 when Lagerfeldt launched the first perfume under his name, poor Chloé had more than her fair share of critics. The perfume was dismissed as being too heavy, too cloying, too sweet and too old-fashioned. Even the design of the bottle, with its soft curves and lily-shaped stopper, was criticised.
Soon, however, its utter originality and unequivocal ambience began to reveal itself and ultimately became an enormous success.

Chloé is, or was, a perfume aimed directly at the heart.
A perfume of love - intimate, unhibited and passionate.
If it is perceived as 'heavy', it´s simply because it is absolutely committed to the exploitation of one dominant flower -
the pervasively lovely tuberose. It clings, it envelops, it persists and permeates, but it does all this with a rare beauty.
Its scent is beautifully rich and creamy, almost euphoric, and when handled by a perfumer of great skill it can be the ideal catalyst, the point of departure.
That´s certainly the case here.

Few perfumes can rival the graceful femininity
of this amber-coloured one.
The dreamlike blend of tuberose, jasmine, spring roses, honeysucke and orangeblossom together with a distinct peach note are seamlessly woven together with a discreet backdrop of oakmoss, musk, amber and a light facet of patchouli.
The total effect is nothing short of hypnotic!

A wonderful, truly great floral composition that is beautiful, mesmerising and soft as silk at all stages of its development.
For such an icon of a perfume, I hope for a deserved comeback of this great classic.
I have a few bottles carefully stored away from light and heat and used on special occasions.

This 1975 Chloé is in my opinion the true Chloé, and has absolutely no relation to the new perfume with the same name.",09/21/15 07:43,calma

ETA: I've been trying to figure out what this reminds me of, and I have it. Chloé smells clean and luxurious like the richest bath products at the fanciest bed and breakfast.

I used to enjoy the heavy, syrupy sweet, almost gooey floral concoction. It is a reminder of Guess jeans, penny loafers, big shirts with shoulder pads and perms (and rooster bangs). I decided a few months after I turned 40 it was time to not necessarily reinvent myself but more like refresh myself and accept that I am officially a woman and not a girl. This fragrance just does not fit my image of myself anymore. There are plenty of old school 80/90's perfumes I still enjoy but my definition of feminity is more along the lines of the lovely French women with pencil skirts and silk blouses...they are timeless...I doubt French women in the 80's used Sun-In and electric blue eyeliner with pink hair mascara pulled through their bangs. I think they have always been the same and that is who I have become. Not trendy or faddish....just timeless..undated.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"Review of vintage edp:

Let me begin by stating that I dislike coconut. On my skin, Chloe opens with a strong wood/rose accord, very dense, and very dry. Within about 15 minutes, the coconut appears This is not an oily coconut, or a suntan lotion coconut, but a toasted,caramelized samoa cookie type coconut- it's actually really wonderful. Combined with the rose and wood, the combination is lazy, warm, and rich. This phase is delicious, almost gourmand to my nose, subtle, comforting, and I find it impossible to stop huffing my wrist!

In the dry down I get lightly sweet honey suckle, a touch of spice from the ylang ylang, orange blossom, and a strong, spicy cedar base. Faint jasmine (in the peachy headspace this note can develop) wafts in and out, by far the most subtle use of this note that I've encountered. I LOVE THIS SCENT! Chloe is truly amazing, and I already feel a need for a back up bottle. This is a scent to be savored, almost indescribable. It is beautifully balanced, and on my skin, remains dry and spicy start to finish. This is what I was expecting from Dune, a rich, spicy, oriental vibe with enveloping heat, like the warmth of sun radiating from a rock face.

I notice that others review this very differently- vintage scents (mine is from the 80s) can age differently, or this may be a function of my skin chemistry, but for me Chloe Chloe is the perfect laid back floriental. I guess I'll have to buy that back up bottle, to be sure!

I highly recommend trying this scent! However, as so many others report different experiences, it may be best to try before buying! Either way, this is one to experience. I honestly thought I would hate it, but this is a scent that I LOVE! I would be perfectly happy to smell like this for the rest of my life.

EDIT: I just tried the reformulation. It is a white musk bomb! The notes of the original may be there, but all are overwhelmed by soap.",05/21/15 14:10,lotus and jasmine
Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"Vintage Lagerfield Pure Parfum:
It starts with a short burst of honeysuckle and orange blossom that flies up your nose, but within seconds there is warmth, spices and a boozy peach that encapsulates you as all sorts of glorious florals come through including tuberose, hyacinth, ylang-ylang, jasmine, narcissus, and lily of the valley. I also noticed a slight woody scent with amber, and oakmoss. It's hard for me to describe this fragrance any further other than that when I smell this it makes me happy.

This Chloe may be dated because its so different from the modern florals but this bold, intoxicating feminine scent is elegant and beautiful. Lots of love for vintage Chloe.",05/10/15 07:48,Walking Unicorn
Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"this starts off all white florals and tuberose. it's kind of powdery and definitely smells 70s/80s to me. i guess this is tuberose, but i feel it's such a melange of florals that it doesn't come off as straight off tuberose really. personally i detect more peach and orange blossom in this, at least at the beginning. after awhile i sense more tuberose, but i think the hyacinth and lilacs are making it seem more powdery and spring-like. i am glad i finally got to try this after all these years, but it's not really for me. i do realize that i recognize and have smelled it on people in the past, which is always interesting.",05/04/15 22:04,mirrorghost

I am actually quite upset that I am not getting the beautiful fragranced loveliness that is being told over and over again. Thats probably down to the formula.The only good thing for me? It has incredible sillage and longevity-- but that only makes it worse if you dont like it! The bottle is just as yawningly boring too lol. Such a damn shame really!

It has a sweetness that is tamed, never gets out of control. I'm surprised because the opening can be quite strong, but soon this symphony of flowers turns quiet and stays that way.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"Review for Chloe Lagerfeld (older version)

Dear God how I miss these older vintage silage bombs! This is the stuff I grew up with as a kid. If you saw this on your Mom or Grandma's vanity and sprayed it, a few washings with Dawn soap could not hide the fact you were snooping through their vanity fragrances and there was no covering it up or washing it off.

Chloe is a very elegant but dated fragrance. Personally it's way to loud for my liking. It's very heavy and strong. This was how perfume used to be made. You would pay a decent price for it at the Dept store however you were never let down. This along with a handful of other 80's scents such as Estee, Cinnabar, Youth Dew were all made to last. It's sad for me to smell fragrances now that are a mere shadow of the power houses we had in the day. Chloe is a true FLOWERBOMB. This is what flowerbomb was meant to be. If your lucky enough to find the vintage version just a small dab will do you the less the better it's nice but only when worn gently. When I say gently it's like spray on a cotton ball and just dab it under clothing. It's that potent.",03/30/15 16:32,perfumeaddiction

I was wondering if I was going to like it at all, as some of the reviews are poles apart but for me this was love at first sniff.

To think that this is the Coty Prestige version, I can only imagine the depth of sweetness of the original version. Oh!

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"I am fond of a good many old fashioned floral bombs, and to me this is the best of the lot. Comments about a hairspray aura in the opening are absolutely accurate. The first time I tried Chloe, my impression was hardly favorable. Overwhelmed, is more like.

But I've grown to love the pungent opening, aware that beyond it is awaiting me the perfect blend of honeysuckle-sweetness. A quiet layer of romantic musk blends all the florals seamlessly together. Tuberose does not run the show, but simpers quietly in the background, behind her gorgeous floral cousins! If you wish to smell unbelievably feminine, I can think of no better choice than Chloe. Beguilement waits behind the hairspray. ;)

All this said, Chloe is also perfectly office appropriate, provided you spray lightly and/or wear under clothing. There's an almost soapy note when worn in a restrained manner, which could easily be your body wash or bath salts lingering softly... Whether to wear as a siren song or a polite, ladylike manner is up to you, but I find Chloe to be a winner in every way imaginable.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"I can't believe I've never tried Chloe before. I've smelled the new version (Chloe EDP), which of course doesn't resemble this (the Lagerfeld) one at all.

I suppose knowing that it had a strong dose of tuberose is what put me off of trying it. I like tuberose, but too much can be headache inducing for me. I was pleasantly surprised by this though. Very lovely, old school tuberose scent! I found it to be a little overwhelming in the opening, but as it settles, it warms up nicely. This is one that you have to go sparingly with as it's heavy and will knock you out if over applied. The dry down is lovely; it get a certain spiciness/sweetness and added warmth on my skin, kinda like a cuddly blanket. Sillage was big and longevity was superb on my skin.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"I wore this back in the 80s and have a distant memory of it being feminine, pretty, rich without being heavy - a little lady-like but not old fashioned. I haven't worn it since then though.

Just the other evening though, I was at an art preview and this person who I normally find really irritating was chatting to me and I noticed she was wearing a lovely and vaguely familiar perfume. It smelled classic (possibly Hermes I wondered?) yet fresh, full and...interesting! So of course I asked what she was wearing, and it was Chloe.

I stuck around longer than usual to chat (I know this makes me sound like an uppity cow, but you've never met this person) because she smelled nice!

We got into a conversation about perfume, as you do, and she revealed that she has quite a collection, including a vintage bottle of Chanel No. 5 in parfum.

Well, there you go - she knows a thing or three about perfume - and she's a good artist to boot.

So the moral of the tale is; some things in life make up for being a bit irritating.

The scent impression was slightly peppery, rich but not heavy or cloying, white floral, elegant and even slightly dewy. I might seek this out again...

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"This review is for the vintage Lagerfeld EdT.

I seem to have reached a stage in my pefume exploration where I can appreciate a fragrance for what it is, without necessarily liking it.

And so it is with Chloe. This is a well balanced white floral (I don't much care for white florals in general) with a very pronounced tuberose note (I REALLY don't care for tuberose). However, the ingredients seem to be of high quality, the composition is nice, and erm - it's very good if you like that kind of thing.

I'm reminded of Anais Anais here, not that they are especially alike, but they were launched at around the same time (1975 and 1978) and they both bewildered me then. As a youg girl just getting interested in fragrance, I was the target market for both - but I just didn't like them, and couldn't work out why. Even then I was much more into Miss Dior and Arpege, and I was delighted when Opium came along.

Now I'm no longer bewildered, I simply realise they are good of their kind, but not to my taste. Marketing is a funny thing - even now I can't see Chloe as a fragrance for young girls.",02/11/14 05:07,blacktaffeta

BUT, this perfume is a transformer! Give it a little time to melt into your skin and work with your chemistry and it becomes a very classic and mysterious little scent. On me, it stays close to my skin.

The aldehydes are apparent, which I think give it that unpleasant smell in the beginning. On the dry down though, the aldehydes go into the background, making room for the warm, comforting smells.

There is a powdery, white floral note that rounds out this otherwise kind of dirty perfume.

I would recommend sampling this on your skin first. Honestly though, its cheap enough on the internet (and apparently in TjMaxx type stores) that you should just buy a bottle of it.

I can't seem to like it in the new formulation and it lacks the nostalgia value too. Eh.,11/05/13 23:04,Mimielle
Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,This smells like what I expect a French perfume to smell like. You can tell it's a classic right away. Not light but then that's what a classic French perfume was originally like. Makes you feel like a woman!,11/01/13 10:47,marine.altunyan

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"I just found the EDT at TJ Maxx at too good a price to pass up, since I've been wanting to try this for a while.
I don't find this scent overwhelming or cloying at all, but I did apply it very lightly. I was quite alarmed when I first applied it, because it smelled like everything wrong with the 80's, but that dissipated quickly and I found myself utterly charmed. It settled within a few minutes into a lovely soft honeysuckle, with a dry woody undertone which seem to save it from tipping over into cloying. About four hours on, it's deepening into jasmine with an earthier base, and I suspect that in another few hours it will have gone softer still, and low and dark and gorgeous. I still need to live with it for a few days, but so far, it's instant infatuation :)",09/21/13 15:08,atroposofnothing
Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"I wore this in the mid 1970's, one of my boyfriend's said it was so strong he could almost taste it. Not a good thing to hear at any time. It was rich,full sophisticated lady scent, and I was a teenager and couldn't pull it off. I recently got a current edition of this, wanted to see how it compared to the 1970's version. It is still a heady tuberose, white floral bombshell of a fragrance, and I can wear it, it doesn't wear me. It lacks some of the depth of the original Chloe, but I still like it very much - it still has decent projection and longevity, at least no one will complain of ""tasting"" it again....the days of perfume smelling that powerful are long gone.

Chloé (Parfums Chloé) Chloé,"My mother has worn this for years. It smells better on her than on me, but it's feminine and soft. I don't generally like a lot of the ""classic"" perfumes--I hated Chanel No 5 for instance--but this one is very pleasant.",09/01/13 21:19,stephm99

It smells fruity, elegant, strong but at the same time so soft.",09/01/13 14:44,lisatenholt

Hysope Chloé,"Starts off with a lush, green neroli burst, very crisp, very fresh, the promising and non-soapy type. Then, this takes a turn into a watery, pretty rosy-clean territory, smoothed out by a delicate touch of tonka which provides it a warm, lightly sweet backbone. But just when you think you’re in the clear, whatever hyssop is supposed to be jumps out with a wild, camphorous, borderline medicinal vegetable note. And I'm not talking in a “fresh garden” way. I'm talking maybe, like, boiled herbs in a fever dream—a nightmare, looking at how pungent this scent has become. It’s sharp, it’s nasal-clearing, and it is NAUSEATING. A betrayal in a bottle.",02/02/25 21:36,luvoxlixir
Hysope Chloé,"What a perfume! Wow! The quality of raw natural materials is obvious, this fragrance smells lile nothing else I tried before. It is not too floral, nor too citrusy, a spring melange beween this tiny misterious flower -hysope- and neroly, fresh raspberry,violets and a touch of rose. It s quite exquisite and peculiar, this is probably how a princess smells. It is a bit expensive but considering everything in it is natural, even the origin of alcohol, and because it s an exclusive collection, worth all the money. Great longevity, solid sillage but not nuclear - hey, it's not made of.arabian molecules which is selling in tones.

Simply amazing!

Hysope Chloé,"Beautiful, effortlessly elegant, timeless scent. Makes me think of Meryl Streep. It was an impulse purchase as a gift to my mom who didn't end up liking it (blind-buying it may not be so safe after all), so I offered to take it home and I'm so glad I did! I can't get enough of it. It smells so clean and soft, almost fluffy throughout the middle and base notes. Sits close to the skin but, if sprayed generously, will send wafts of its lovely aroma whenever you move. Although violet is listed, I don't smell much of it at all. It's mostly soft rose, hyssop, raspberry, and tonka.

If you like it but can't justify the price point, check out S'Oliver For Her: The opening is a bit screechy but the dry-down is surprisingly similar. It lacks the slightly citrusy flower note, which must be hysope, but the DNA is there.

And if you used to love Gucci II in the 2000s, check this one out for that nostalgic raspberry note.",09/16/24 09:56,Extravaganza

Hysope Chloé,"Unique. It is fresh just in the beginning. Emanates clean vibe, sort of herbal aroma. However at the dry down it is deep, heavy and mature fragrance. Maybe it is hysope?

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Ah, I still remember how much I wanted this perfume to work out for me… smelled it on someone back in 2017 and got obsessed with it. Unfortunately, after purchasing it for myself, I got repulsed by it. I think it wasn’t compatible with my skin chemistry, because it was very challenging to go through the day wearing this composition. Ended up giving it away to my friends’ mom.
Works beautifully on some, and absolutely terrible on others 😅 Do not blind buy even if the palette looks very appealing and familiar to you, make sure you try it first.

Also, all Chloe perfumes that has that little silver top on the bottle, oxidizes very quickly and start looking dark and dirty after a few months. Not sure if that’s a common issue or it’s just humidity/ environment that caused it… but I had three different bottles of Chloe with that silver top and all of them tarnished very quickly even though I did nothing to it.",08/29/25 05:42,ItsyourgirlAri
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"This pretty much does what it says on the box. It stands halfway between the brands eponymous Eau de Parfum and Diptyques Eau Rose. Quite close to the latter even.

A more lifelike rose than its predecessor, foregoing clean freshness in favor of crisp botanicals. Rosewater misted on actual garden variety roses, big beautiful petals grown for aesthetics rather than aromatics. A faint whiff of fruit juice sweetness, store brand fruit punch but as one remembers it from childhood. Nostalgic in the way of pink herbal essences or any other early 00's fresh fruit-musk concoction.

Understated, fresh, dainty...yet sensual enough to be sexy. A bit like a Sade song; tender and sweet, but also deeply romantic and sexy. The rose isn't overbearing, but you know it's there. All the other notes support the rose and uphold it as the main note. So so so perfect. My daily scent this year.",07/04/25 22:12,onikaburger
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Light, sweet and girly rose. To my nose this is generic and boring but quite pleasant parfume.

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"This fragrance has been with me since 2014. I wore it for my wedding that September. It felt like me, fresh, romantic, full of light. I’ve bought it again and again. It’s one of those perfumes I always want around, especially in the warmer months. The lychee at the start is juicy, almost watery. So transparent, it feels like biting into fruit straight from the fridge. But blink, and it’s gone. The real story here is the rose. 🌸
Not just any rose. This one is pink, soft, just blooming. Young but elegant. Clean, airy, and full of grace. It doesn’t try hard, and that’s exactly why it works. It’s not powdery, not overly sweet. Just… beautiful.
There’s something about it that feels innocent. But not naïve. It’s polished. Feminine. Refined. The kind of scent that leaves an impression without ever shouting. I’ve smelled dozens — maybe hundreds — of rose perfumes. Now, the downside: it vanishes fast. Two hours, maybe. It doesn’t cling. It’s a whisper. I wish it stayed longer. But maybe that’s part of its charm — like fresh flowers that fade, but you remember them anyway.
What can I say? It made me feel like myself. Clean. Loved. Romantic.",06/10/25 20:50,mindzy
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I remember first tasting lychees in my 30s in Dubai. Seeing them I thought they’d be similar to strawberries. After peeling them their texture felt like the inside of grapes, but when I tasted them, OH! rosewater! with some juicy, tangy sweetness to them. I’ve known many flowers with fruity nuances but that was the first time I sensed a floral nuance to a fruit.
When I first smelled Roses de Chloe, it transported me to that moment. The first couple of minutes are a very realistic lychee flavor, but it’s very transient. It is soon overtaken by the smell of very fresh, youthful, innocent, pink rosebuds, just starting to bloom; a very, very lovely rose indeed. Then a squeaky clean, white musk, almost detergent-like looms. The musk gradually overpowers the roses, so in the late dry down, it is mainly the white musk. Those beautiful roses are still there but are in the background now. The elegance of simplicity, a strong like from me.",05/28/25 03:35,Tinabill
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I expected more from this fragrance based on the notes. To my nose it's almost identical to Idole EDT which I don't like that much. This is a green rose, not fully bloomed yet, very light and underwhelming - the best I can describe it. It's wearable in warm weather but it's not my type of rose.

If you are worried that this perfume is now being discontinued, sample Idole EDT and see how it compares - it's even better and fresher than this one in my opinion.",04/26/25 09:45,Elyka21

I got a sample because a review of Diptyque’s Eau Rose said this smells exactly like it. I disagree! Eau Rose is a very dewy, fresh, green rose that feels more like rosewater and I think it has a lovely gentle sillage. Roses de Chloé smells heavier and way more soapy. It clings to your skin in a way that Eau Rose doesn’t, and I feel like the sillage is poor. I think it’s mediocre at best.",02/19/25 16:09,Sleepy_cactus

Like Chloe, it is a modern classic for sure. For me it is a photorealistic rose with some of the green stems. First impression is fragrant rose, I don't get much depth from the other notes. Gives a three foot bubble before settling into a skin scent after a half hour.

Wanted this for years and finally bought a 30mL full size from Nordstrom Outlet. The metal on the bottle has tarnished. I don't know if my tastes have changed but it doesn't smell like I remembered having more depth than a straight rose. Wore at home. Would not repurchase.",08/13/24 03:15,thewho

It is a very simple fragrance - it misses any base notes, it leaves my skin within 2 hours but still somehow manages to give me an headache. It is sharp and smells almost like scented laundry detergant was stuck under my nose. I am very sad for the money wasted. I much prefer the Yardley English Rose - also lasts for a short time and misses base but it smells really natural and costs only pennies.

The sweetness here is really pleasing, with borderline candyish facets that are balanced very nicely by more refined green notes, like juicy green apple and crisp, woody rose stems.

It's soapy and playful, like an outdoor clawfoot bathtub that's foaming over with sudsy kids' bubble bath, and sits nestled against the side of a big, sprawling rosebush heavy with pink blossoms.

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"A natural non-candied rose in this captivated my attention. It’s not very complicated but somehow we’ll blended anyway. It lasts a notably long time on my skin, significantly longer than most floral perfumes. After 14 hours it’s still on me. Doesn’t have too many chapters of evolution but rather a consistent presence. The roses stay pleasant throughout the journey.

If you can’t stand roses why would you even get this? Either way it’s probably not going to be around for long. I acquired a bottle because I like the scent and it performs superbly on me. (Somehow summary here suggests lack of longevity but I have to highlight, even as that’s not my top priority in fragrance this one lasts and lasts on me - like >24 hours kind of thing. Idk re sillage as it’s even further from my priority to bombard others with my fragrance — but honestly this is a longer lasting floral. Fairly easy to wear and pleasant to most but it isn’t a whisper of a mist of a dream of a fragrance, you know? It is pleasant but present, and present a long time!",11/09/23 21:15,ace.kittyhawk

If you wanna smell like a naturally pretty pink flower that doesn't have a mean bone in her body this is it. You can't go wrong here.

This is the girl that's naturally charismatic because people genuinely like her and you can't dislike her if you tried, because she's just so wholesome.

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I have the roller of this scent and it really doesn’t last long on my skin at all but I don’t really care- just keep reapplying throughout the day. It smells so nice, like a real backyard garden rose; femme, clean, soft & intimate. I think I could wear this for any occasion. My favourite thing about this scent is that it pairs really well with others- it you want just an added layer of rose thrown in this does the trick without overpowering.",08/03/23 12:35,cymbidium
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I've been on the hunt for a fresh rosy perfume for a while, I've tried Francis Kurkdjian La Rose, Tom Ford Rose Prick, Jo Malone Red Roses and I can say this one is by far my favorite. I'm very picky when it comes to perfume, many fragrances give me throbbing headaches or mix terribly with the chemistry of my skin but I am pleasantly surprised by this one. I think the powdery aspect gives the green a good balance, Red roses was wayyyy too green for my liking and it felt like there was nothing to offset that. When sprayed on my skin, it lasts so long, I'm on hour 8 and am still catching whiffs. Oddly reminds me of Golf Le Fleur French Waltz but more feminine and sophisticated. I'm awaiting on my bottle of Diptyque Eau Rose and if that doesn't please me I will be buying a full bottle of this. Clean, romantic, and perfect for any occasion.",07/16/23 15:14,sendmealovenote
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I’m very disappointed in longevity, I sprayed Burberry fruity on other hand so compare to Burberry this was very weak, at first I didn’t like it but drydown was nice but 2 hours and was completely gone, while Burberry was there for rest of the day. So I don’t even bother to describe scent (which I like), waste of money, quality isn’t there.",07/14/23 10:00,Jordan 99
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Chloé's Roses De Chloé fragrance is really nice, but I found the longevity a bit wanting. It only lasted just over 3 hours on my skin. The projection is about moderate though and you can smell it an arm's length away. I think it would be very appropriate for both office and casual settings because of this.

The smell of this fragrance is a fairly naturalistic rose, but I don't think that it smells as naturalistic or as good as Annick Goutal's Rose Absolue perfume. I'd say that this rose fragrance (Chloé's, that is) is a fair amount more citrusy and a little bit more fruity from the bergamot, lemon, blackcurrant and apple notes that I detect. A bit grassy from the tarragon note that I can smell, too.

I still think that this is quite nice, but not really full bottle-worthy for me. That's why I'd give Roses De Chloé a 7.5/10. If you're wanting a great photorealistic rose fragrance, try Rose Absolue by Annick Goutal.",06/27/23 03:22,WhiteFlowerPrincess

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Im not a fan of Chloe, I have never used the creamy one yet I tried this cuz somehow Im obsessed with roses fragrance. The opening Im not gonna say that I Love it but still, it is nice, it just didn't be like how I have expected. The opening is roses, like a bunch of fresh roses, A REAL ROSE. After sometime I sense sth citrus maybe the lemon or litchi but it's only a few, and lastly I can smell musk, anyway it would have been better if the sillage and Longevity is doing better. On my skin it lasts only 2hr and gone, I know this is edt but I have tried some another edt, it has longer longevity than this. And if gonna talk about sillage, it just not work on me, anyway maybe all of this thing is bc of my skin chemistry doesn't match with it🥲",05/05/23 05:42,chadam_.
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I am a huge huge fan of original Chloe. I even love the newest flanker with the tangerine but this one I cannot seem to love. I think it's because the soapy note is missing all together. It's kind of like a very very light rose perfume. Extremely light. If you're looking for something to wear to work if you work in a hospital or something, this could be the one. I bought a huge bottle of it as soon as it came out because I thought I would love it like I love all their flankers. Listing it for sale online. I just will never reach for this. It makes me kind of sad because I thought it was going to be like an intense Chloe since Chloe already smells like rose. I thought it was going to end up maybe smelling like a soapy Stella absolute. That's Stella Rose absolute is still the best rose I've ever smelled",04/30/23 19:27,waskotransportation
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I'm on a quest to find another fragrance love since Stella cannot be my one and only, especially since it's discontinued. The rep at Sephora recommended this. Sprayed it on my wrist and this was so bleugh. It opens with a full blast of roses, then dries down to this soapiness. The soapiness was almost sharp on me, which was not pleasant. Then towards the end, it started turning sour, like in a sappy way. Scrubber.",03/10/23 10:34,stella.cherie

I’m a lover of old garden heritage roses, with their strong and unique fragrances, but this smells like a generic red rose straight from the supermarket refrigerator. The other slight notes make it more interesting. I had high hopes as a big fan of the OG Chloe. I like it, just not as much as I hoped with my blind buy.

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I just got this today, i got three travel size rollerballs. My mom (85) got one, and i (49) took one, and i will give one to my daughter (22). Very nice rose, pretty much straight up rose, very beautiful. I think this is a great scent for layering over something else that is deep or dark. I may try this with botega vennetta. My mom loves it too. I do not seem to get noseblind to this. I think you could use this for traveling and no one around you would be upset. It smells like you took a bath with rose soap, but in a good way.
Update: i never gave my daughter the other rollerball i kept it. She actually loves the original chloe, where i am not as in love with it, i prefer this.
One thing i have noticed is i tend to like the work of certain perfumers — i have many by amandine clerc marie and i fell in love recently with izia by sisley. If you like rose you should give it a go!",10/09/22 10:26,AuthenticAF
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I’m a sucker for a great realistic rose scent & after reading all the terrific reviews, I so wanted this perfume to be a staple in my collection. Because it truly is a wonderful tea rose scent. On me - for less than an hour. I have experimented with different ways to increase longevity. I’ve sprayed it into non-scented lotion and lathered it on. That extended the scent for a short time. The best was to directly spray it on clothes.

But one of it’s charms seems to be that it is a light scent you can spray on anytime without fear of over spraying; so I will use it for before bed time and anytime I want that lovey tea rose fragrance for a short time. But I will not be purchasing another bottle. Hopefully, this perfumery can figure out a way to make this into an EDP with increased silage and longevity. That would really be something special.",09/02/22 13:46,Allegoria

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"This perfume is wonderful. At first smell all I got was rose. But as it progressed, it blossomed. Fresh cut rose with sour orange upon arrival, sweet soapy rose next, finishing to a musky dry down. Lemon is also ever-present. It’s not too heavy or old ladylike as other rose perfumes can be. Moderate longevity. Can definitely be layered, but I prefer it on its own. The projection is great on me and I have dry skin. This may be my new spring perfume. I’ll have to stock up before they discontinue it.",08/17/22 12:36,Itslorr
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"This is a beautiful, bright, dewy rose fragrance. It's one that can be worn year round. It doesn't smell mature or heavy; I can see younger or youthful ladies enjoying this fragrance.

few months.
However now we are in full rose season in the garden somehow I found myself craving this fragrance. For two weeks now I can’t get enough of it! It it’s extremely long lasting on my skin, on spray and I can smell it on myself for hours and then I can still smell for the rest of the day when I bring my wrist to my nose.
The following day it is still on the skin as a soft gentle gorgeous musk.
Funny I disliked it immediately after buying, but now i could drink it now that it’s summer season.",06/06/22 22:52,anthemily
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I didn't love it initially. It felt dated and not nearly as delicate as the OG Chloe EDP. As it dried I began to appreciate this soapy rose, but it isn't something I'd repurchase",04/18/22 16:44,nickinicole
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Oh... my beloved is long gone now. My mother just gifted me a 50mL bottle of this a few weeks ago and I must say it is heavenly. I already adored the og signature Chloe but this is, certainly, the best.

Imagine a fresh field of roses, soaked in dew as it dries in the sun. Precisely how it smells to me after it dries down.

I suppose my generation is very fearful of rosy perfumes, probably due to the heavy stigma of old woman enjoying the smell. Do not mistake this for any dated smell of roses or even cemetery flowers you have smelt in the past. It is entirely *fresh*. The roses smell as though as just harvested, almost as if you crunched a blossom in your hands and the residue remained there for hours still, enveloping you with it's background flowers and musks.

In my humble opinion Chloe should not shy away from this fragrance whatsoever, as it pleases both the young and the old costumers of the house. The first because of it's modern spin with the added lemon and green notes at first - smelling youthful and crisp. And as for the second due to it's robust rosy body, an ingredient sure to make the elder swoon because of how refreshingly modern it made such an usual scent feel.

Needless to say - it smells just as clean as can be. Highly recommed to those prone to headaches/migraines as it does not smell even the least bit sweet to me. Suitable for the office, a casual date during the day, informal situations of all kinds in both spring and summer alike. Hard to be disliked. RIP. 🎀",03/28/22 23:12,suchascentfreak

Granted, it was only $30, but still. I’m not sure what about it I’m not wild about. Maybe I’m just not a rose person.

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Thin, short lived, unsatisfying, costly (for what it is), and ultimately boring.

I wish there was a better conclusion, but there you have it! No offense intended to Chloe Rose lovers. I'm sure you smell good and that your taste is good. I expect more performance, sillage, and panache at this level.

If it helps any, I also feel this way about a great many other designer rose based releases. They lack character and substance and the promise of a lovely soliflore rose dies as the fragrance rapidly fades.... Little to no projection or longevity is common with 'modern' rose, alas, or else it is extended and amplified with patchouli or fruits, thus making it not a soliflore at all.

The answer? There is no holy grail rose for me yet, but for a modern rose the best I could ever hope for is Paul Smith Roses! It is everything I'd ever hoped the mainstream designers would release and then some. Airy, long lasting, strong sillage, pink, and lovely. It is Chloe Roses Done Right.",02/18/22 19:00,drugstore classics

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"At first spray, Chloe Roses smells exactly like a fresh bouquet that has just been removed from a flower shop refrigerator. Cool, a bit green, fresh tea roses scent blooms and grows stronger as the bouquet warms to room temperature. At this point, projection is moderate and remains so for about 2 hours before fading slowly into a close to skin scent. Not powdery. A touch of lightweight white musk gently floats like a soft cloud around these roses. Tarragon and wood notes make me think of a garden bed and keep the scent from being too sweet.

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"A fresh, soapy rose scent that reminds me of hanging sheets to dry on a crisp spring day. I prefer this to the original Chloe but it nonetheless feels cluttered - the peach note feels completely out of place, too sexy for the rest of the composition. Admittedly, I wear this often because it is nice and relatively inoffensive but after this bottle I don’t think I’ll buy another. It gives off a pretty, youthful, plain aura - sweet, but not a head-turner. Great for the office, or a first date picnic, not so much for compliments or head-turning. I will say that it seems to strike some people as muskier - I have an extremely sensitive nose and doesn’t strike me as a particularly strong scent, but my mother thinks it’s too musky.",12/20/21 00:41,Jasmine7

The musk turns into warm velvet during the drydown turning cozy over time; quite a change from that bright fruity opening, actually. That super sweet bright note is very much gone now and left behind the velvety rose petals in its wake. The drydown of this is much better than the opening but you've got to be a fan of musk, first and foremost. Nice but not my style. Feminine and best for cold weather.",10/17/21 12:59,NDStars

Big love.",08/25/21 12:47,mariamarouli91
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"The first thing you get with Roses de Chloé is a noseful of the most beautiful red roses in full bloom. After 10 minutes, it becomes a trite red rose with maybe some red berries it it. While not being all bad, it reminds me of red gummi bears. I don't hate it, but it also does not excite me as well.

1 hour in, the rose turns pink and the fragrance becomes dewy and nice. This is hands down a very beautiful stage of this perfume where it slightly reminded me of Stella by Stella McCartney.

2 hours after the initial application, the pink dewy rose dries down to a classic rose with warm undercurrents. The berry notes are gone. At this point, although not unique, this rose scent is still nice. It remains like this for two more hours until the big let-down. This is when the rose turns all musty and unpleasant. I got a strong musk note that, while probably being synthetic, does carry a bit of an animalic component which I don't love.This is where the fragrance remains until after six hours, the scent is gone without a trace.

Roses de Chloé is an unisex fragrance leaning in the feminine direction. I find it appropriate for many age-groups, although compared with the classic Chloé EdP it feel approximately 10 years younger and is best worn by people from their 20s to their late 40s.

All that being said, I don't think I can recommend this fragrance. I do not think it is an altogether awful perfume, but it just isn't that great either. This is the thing with rose fragrances: there are just so many great alternatives. Especially given its rather awful final few hours, Roses de Chloé is just too much of a rollercoaster ride for me.

TL;DR: red, dewy gummy bear rose, turns musty on some skin.",08/21/21 18:06,Eribert

on paper it’s really lovely, but not sensational.. it really is a clean, green natural rose like mentioned in previous reviews. love it!!!
overall okay.. an 8/10 from me tbh, but it’s not FBW. especially with it’s weak longevity :( only bought this one because i got it for a great deal online. i think there are cheaper offers out there for rose perfumes like this one",07/14/21 21:44,adelaidesandrina
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"This is a no-fuss rose. Clean, mildly soapy, but the rose is absolutely the star of the show. This is a fresh and green rose, there's almost no sweetness. Totally inoffensive and perfect if you're looking for something simple, feminine, and easy to wear. I do feel this is a tad overpriced for how simple it is. It reminds me of many other non-designer rose scents, like BBW Rosewater and Ivy or some of the rose offerings from The Body Shop. You're really just paying for the bottle with Roses de Chloe (but let's be honest, it's quite a cute bottle!)

Edit: Had to change this from like to love. This is my favorite rose ever, a very soapy, freshly laundered linen rose. I hate how pathetic the performance is, this is one of the weakest fragrances I've ever tried, it's undetectable within 2 hours.",06/21/21 18:04,clairesque
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"The more I wear this, the more it resembles me of Delina PdM.
A true scent of natural rose with a bit of cleanness (a little bit soapy which I absolutely love) and some sweetness of fruits. My untrained nose picks up rose, a hint of magnolia, and the musk.

I have bought the smallest bottle and it's the cutest thing ever! The longevity is reasonable and the people around me notice this scent very well. My headaches tell me I cannot overspray this, but the 4 sprits (2 in each arm) are enough for me to scent this all day. The dry down is beautiful, a clean rose that sits very well on the skin.

If you like Delina but don't want to splurge like me, give this a sniff!",06/01/21 01:28,Liliana Ângelo

I feel like this is a well balanced fragrance, but the longevity, like many other Chloe scents, is not there. I only get about 3 hours of this before it becomes purely a skin scent. It's pretty, dainty, girly, and worth purchasing if you're not paying full price.",05/22/21 04:50,DaniBear1121
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Roses de Chloe is what I wanted Philosophy's Ballet Rose to be... the two are very similar, sharing the same beautiful rose/litchi/musk scent profile, but RdC is deeper, more nuanced (more fruit and wood accords), and lasts longer.

Ballet Rose is (or was, rather, since I've swapped it away) completely gone off my skin in about 2 hours. RdC sticks around for about 4-5 hours on me.

It's easy to like and enjoy, as are the rest of the Chloes that I've tried, but I know I don't like them nearly enough to pay full retail. I received a sample and a partial bottle of RdC in two separate swaps as freebies, and I purchased Chloe EDP at a significant discount. They're enjoyable, easy to like scents, but the MSRP is laughable. Get them at a discount and take 'em for a spin--there's very little to dislike about the line.",05/15/21 11:47,Tolkashutka

Something about Chloe's rose scents just don't work with me, and all I get on myself is rose-scented baby powder. I get a very innocent and polite vibe from this, so it's a safe blind buy if you know and love Chloe's style of rose, but it's really not for me.",05/10/21 21:38,blindboughtjunkie

Until one day I walked through Anthropologie and sprayed one of the perfumes they carried on me and it smelled identical to this. Lollia ""Always in Rose"" is a rose & hibiscus perfume that smells so much like this, for a big bottle for half the cost.

My nose picks up the peach, and mixed with the rose, is so beautiful. I haven't smelled the original of this line, so I can't compare, but this was another blind buy win.",03/27/21 14:33,Roses1357
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Pretty rose that starts with some fruit, but it doesn't scream ""lychee"" at me. I wish it did though, I love lychee. Anyways, the fruity freshness doesn't last very long. Within a few minutes we've moved into definite straight rose territory. It is a light, airy, springtime rose. It stays this way until fading away a couple of hours later. This smells 80% like the original Chloe to me, but less sharp and lower longevity.",03/20/21 19:05,fyetan
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Ohh this one is so lovely, like a romantic rose. Not too heavy, just a delicate rose, light and airy with woody base. And for me it's really different from Goldea",02/28/21 22:14,Lalala99

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I associate different fragrances with specific items of clothing and settings. In this case, I imagine Roses de Chloe on a woman in a white sundress on a summer afternoon. She is sipping on iced tea with a group of female friends. This is not a sexy scent necessarily.... its more friendly, youthful and casual.

Roses de Chloe is a light, linear rose scent. This is not a complex fragrance by any means. Rose perfumes have a reputation for smelling ""matronly"" but in this case, there is a slight freshness and fruitiness that prevents it from being dated. I know melon is not one of the listed notes but I swear I can smell something along those lines in the top notes. The melon vibe fades after a few minutes and then the fragrance is a pure rose. Though its an EDT, I find it to have decent longevity, particularly on clothes.",02/04/21 13:07,Cristinaaa
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,Smells like a fresh cut rose. So realistic. I prefer this over Stella.,01/04/21 06:56,Sreza7
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"My favorite Spring fragrance. Sweet clean rose mixed with magnolia. The dry down on me is amazing. It’s a white musk that sticks to my skin and is almost imperceptible, but is there. I’m on my second bottle of this juice.
It’s not sexy, not offensive, just pure and lovely.",12/27/20 19:44,Love2smellgoox
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"This smells exactly like a freshly cut rose. Delicate, beautiful and romantic. One of the most gorgeous perfumes I've ever smelt and by far the best rose one.",12/11/20 02:47,rosegoldrosie
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"My boyfriend's sister wears Chloe Eau de Parfum and I always wondered (still do) what in the world makes me so nauseous about that fragrance.
All this to say - I was initially hesitant of Roses de Chloe. I tried in on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised! I was looking for an everyday rose solifore and this is it (I initially purchased Rosa Nobile from Acqua di Parma and couldn't stand it - it gave me a headache and it reminded me of a potpourri grandma smell).
In this fragrance, I don't smell any of the other notes mentioned besides rose; perhaps a little musk but that's it. Especially no cedar, black currant, apple or peach.
I purchased this fragrance and I'm currently wearing it right next to Hiram Green's Lustre. What a difference! Curious to see Chloe's longevity.

Edit: I really enjoy this fragrance. It reminds me SO much of Daisy Eau So Fresh (pink bottle) but it's a little more elegant.",11/13/20 11:43,gmaster
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I agree with other reviewers, this is a very delicate and natural rose. It’s crisp, clean and easy to wear. I feel like a ballerina when I wear this, because it just feels/smells like that creamy pink color of ballerinas’ ensembles. However, I have a few male friends who wear this and it smells so nice on them. This isn’t as a blooming bouquet smell, it’s more of the soapy smell of the original Chloe accompanied by a clean rose. One of my favs 💕",10/12/20 07:42,personalskin2520
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"This is the most natural rose you could ever smell, according to me. Absolutely lovely. I have the original Chloe too, and love that one as well. If I would have to choose between the two, I couldn’t... but the original is more of a city rose for me, from a florist shop, given by your admirer, or your man. Enjoying city summer. But this one: it is more of an oldfashioned and softly intensive garden rose. Fresh in the morning, when you go out in the dewy grass.
The difference of colour in the packaging is just right, I think.
The only downside with this: might be the shorter longevity. The projection and the sillage is weaker than the original, but that does not have to be a downside. You just choose the fragrances for different occasions.
And if I, when I can afford yet another fragrance, do buy a bigger bottle ( I only have a 30 ml, with little left) I can allow myself to respray a bit during the day.
Beautiful enough for very special occasions, but can also be worn just for oneself to feel calmly fabulous and happy, an otherwise normal day at home.",09/16/20 02:11,Miasha
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"This fragrance from Chloe was hugely disappointing, it smelled like plastic roses and increased this feeling the intense citrus dose present in the heart of the fragrance gave the feeling that it was a cheap perfume that seems like air fresheners.. I tried to love it but I couldn't 🥴",08/27/20 03:48,shady111777
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I was suprised to read the reviews and learn I'm not the only one who feels a bit sick when sniffing this perfume. For some reason it's nausea inducing. Apart from that, the scent itself - objectively, perhaps.. - is good. Wanted to love it but couldn't physically",08/23/20 13:07,merely_there_b
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"This is the fragrance that does not need many words.

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I'll be honest I smell absolutely no notes in this apart from the rose. Inoffensive, subtle, linear (on me) and very pleasant smell, though not very intriguing or good value for money (as the commenter below me mentioned as well). To me there's nothing unique enough in this to be worth the price. I also hate how the metal on Chloe fragrances rusts/oxidizes. If I ever want a gentle rose perfume, I will look for something that's half or third the price of this one.",06/29/20 08:38,kkaattjjeess
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"If you like rose, I think this is a safe blind buy just for the scent alone. You may think it's not groundbreaking, long lasting or good value for money but you can't deny how PRETTY and DELICATE this is. Furthermore, as simple as the composition is, this is one of my more complimented perfumes. This is for a woman who doesn't try too hard, but still comes off as elegant and refined. Try it, it probably won't blow you away but I come back to this time and time again because it's beautiful and refreshing.",06/28/20 13:31,kaya0101
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I got a sample sprayer forever ago from Sephora, and I never really tested it; it just went into a basket with a bunch of other samples. As I am bored AF and also curious about where my collection stands, I have been slowly going through things to see what I want to keep and what needs to go. I grabbed this thinking it was the regular Chloe namesake fragrance, which I find inoffensive, but was pleasantly surprised when I was hit in the face with roses. For a mainstream brand, this is a good rose fragrance. It reminds me a lot of the original formulation of Stella McCartney's Stella, just slightly softer. I am surprising myself a lot, but I definitely will pick up a FB of this since a good mainstream rose fragrance is something that I love to have and the new Stella isn't as good for me.",06/26/20 21:22,pleasuretoburn
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,Instant classic smells like clean and fresh roses 🌹. You can’t go wrong with this. I adore and have gotten compliments on this one. It’s a practical scent suitable for work.,05/05/20 19:34,Lovetolove
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"This reminds me of Rose 2000, and at times throughout its development, Rose 2000 had trace whispers of Parfum sacre (both spiced rose perfumes). Both, were perhaps .?? a touch heavier than RDChloe.
Anyway, RDC is BEAUTIFUL. . AND it smells more beautiful as it dries down in its captivating and slight complexity - so wait for it.
Doesnt nearly everyone appreciate the soft faint smell of a fresh opening rose ? A bit sweet but not too so.
Quite therapeutic and inviting is Roses De Chloe. It is a garden you want to enter and stay in , because, it feels alive and real.
Lasts nicely, freshly, and i smell a faint greenery surround throughout its wear.
Anyone should try this - guys as well. You'll be surprised !",04/20/20 15:55,delightme5
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I bought this perfume as a blind buy because I wanted a) a Chloe scent in my collection and b) a rose scent.

The bottle - beautiful, classy, feminine. You can't go wrong with the bottle design.

The initial spray gives me nothing but roses upon roses. It's almost too much - but shortly after when it starts to dry down you get that classic Chloe DNA that's a bit more tart, woody, floral. There's nothing sweet about this fragrance. I haven't tried it on my skin yet, but on paper and at the atomizer, it's a classic Chloe fragrance but heavy on the rose.

Lovely. Classy. It makes me feel like a classy high society lady in the UK.

To me it's probably the most sophisticated classically floral scent I own. I'm not sure when I'll wear it - but it'll be during the spring and summer during the day for sure.

As a disclaimer, I tend to like more of the vanilla, powdery florientals.

This fragrance is a 7/10 for me.",03/31/20 14:11,codymarieb
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I wanted to make Roses De Chloe my next spring rose but I can't. I've been testing it a few days and kept being reminded of another scent that was burned into my brain as a pre-teen in the late nineties... Tommy Girl. A scent I never liked for myself but smelled all around me as it grew in popularity among my peers. It also brings to mind Lancome Miracle and Versace Bright Crystal. Just like Tommy Girl, that magnolia note in Roses De Chloe is sharp and loud and takes over whatever it is accompanied by. While I wanted watery rose and lychee in a Chloe DNA, I'm actually getting mostly magnolia and nondescript fruit. The rose is just an afterthought. Shame since I remember liking it years ago. I must not have tested it long enough or my tastes changed after having a baby (likely the latter). The upside is that's one less perfume to want.",02/28/20 19:42,Swedelish
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I love the current Chloe line. Each fragrance represents different facets of rose and emphasises them. Unfortunately I’m slightly anosmic to the other offerings (L’Eau and Fleur) and this is the best alongside Chloe EDP. All the fragrances are along a similar theme and I have to say this is such a pretty soft rose. The opening is possibly a little too on the tart citrusy side for me but the dry down is absolutely to die for. I would love this to layer with Chloe EDP I think and I will purchase this fragrance soon. It’s not too soapy or powdery but just perfect with the mild fruitiness. Gorgeous.

I would not compare to Sisley Izia or Paul Smith Rose as Izia is much soapier, dryer and less sweet/soft and Paul Smith is much sharper and more tart. Izia is a very different kind of fragrance as Sisley has a very distinct sort of style and Paul Smith is a very linear sort of rose.
This is soft and cosy and pretty and I wish it came in a bigger size... to be honest would not compare this with any other rose fragrance as this has very distinctive Chloe DNA and is not at all similar to other rose fragrances I have tried.",02/25/20 21:01,Jmalone84
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Very pleasant and unique rose: realistic and balanced. More sweet than fresh, not powdery, soapy or Oriental. I borderline love it. It has been compared to a Montale, and I can see that, though it is speaking of strength and quality I suppose... it isn't as intense for sure, and I like that. Has a touch of my beloved roses from Roses Musk, but the sensuality of musk here is dialed down, and the roses are louder. I wish my bottle of Chloe EDP could magically be replaced with a bottle of Roses de Chloe!",10/19/19 16:56,kastehelmi
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"The first 3-4 hours are really lovely. Unmistakable rose, but modern and fresh smelling rather than traditional. It manages to be sophisticated yet youthful, and romantic without being ""sexy"". I can imagine it being appropriate for most occasions. Buuuut... After about 4 hours it dries to a strange sour greasy smell which I don't enjoy at all. This might just be my nose though because no one I ask knows what I mean!! Also it does smell very similar to Paul Smith rose.",10/16/19 07:36,CrazyCrab
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"A MASTERPIECE!

This is an actual garden of roses, bottled. It’s soft, sensual, elegant, romantic and just plain wonderful. I get compliments every time I wear this and I wear it a lot because I just love it so much. An everyday, versatile, completely inoffensive fragrance. I generally love Chloé’s fragrances, but this one is definitely one of my top favorites, if not my favorite. I wear it to bed sometimes because it’s so lovely and calming and I can never seem to get enough of it. Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous!

Thank you, Chloé!",10/11/19 15:09,wickedsoul
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Lovely fragrance! Very feminine and romantic. I get a sweet, a bit powdery and warm rose. Very comforting and pleasant. I am positively surprised.
It reminded me of Valentino Donna, but Roses de Chloé is younger. It also reminded me of Rose Goldea, but Roses de Chloé is less soapy.
This is the perfect perfume for a soft, sensitive and sensual girl.
It’s inoffensive, appropriate for all occasions.
Sillage is soft.
Thumbs up! It goes to my wish list.

I prefer Paul Smith rose by far over this one, that one is the best rose fragrance I've ever come across and for the price it is a steal, it is so much more special and smells absolutely gorgeous, this was a definate flop for me x",08/24/19 05:43,babyrose1985

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"ย้อนไปสัก 5 ปีก่อนหน้าที่เทรนด์น้ำหอมหวานหยาดเยิ้มเหมือนน้ำเชื่อมอย่างลาวิเอเบลที่ฮิตกันตอนนี้จะมา กลิ่นแนวกุหลาบลิ้นจี่อย่าง Chole นี้เราจะได้กลิ่นฟุ้งอยู่ทั่วทุกหัวถนน

สาวออฟฟิช 1 ในสิบคนน่าจะเคยผ่านกลิ่นนี้ เรียกได้ว่าใส่กลิ่นนี้ซ้ำกันทุกโบกี้ BTS เชียวละ

ก็จะไม่ใช้ฮิตได้อย่างไรในเมื่อแนวกลิ่นแสนน่ารัก สดใส ใช้ง่าย แต่ยังหรูหราเหมือนคุณหนูผู้ไม่เคยย่างเท้าขึ้นรถเมล์ กลิ่นกระจายตัวดีในอากาศชื้นๆอย่างบ้านเรา ทั้งยังหาซื้อง่ายราคาไม่แพงอีก แถมติดทนเสียอีก

เพื่อนสจ้วตข้าพเจ้าท่านหนึ่งเคยกรุ่นกลิ่นด้วยโจมาโลนนัคทารีนและน้ำผึ้ง จู่ๆก็เปลี่ยนกลิ่นเป็นกลิ่นหอมแหลมของกุหลาบ แทรกโทนหวานฉ่ำคล้ายน้ำลิ้นจี่กระป๋องแช่เย็น และน้ำมันมะกรูดนุ่ม

ทางเราได้ดมแล้วชอบมาก ตะบอยถามนางอยู่หลายรอบนางก็ไม่ยอมตอบ อุบไว้หอมคนเดียว จนเราต้องไปตามเจอเองว่าเป็นกลิ่นโคลเอ้นี่เอง

ตามธรรมดาโคลเอ้จะจำแนกกันง่ายๆด้วยสีโบว์พันรอบคอขวด นอกจากความหวานเข้มข้นกุหลาบน้ำผึ้งของโบว์ดำ ก็มีโบว์ชมพูนี่แหละที่ชอบ

ใส่กุหลาบลงไปหนักมือหน่อย แต่กลิ่นเบาอ่อนหวานกว่าโบว์ครีม อาจจะหรูหราน้อยลงแต่สดใสมากขึ้น เบาพริ้วกว่าเดิม

เสียดายเก็บไว้นานแทนที่กลิ่นจะกลมกล่อมนวลเนียนขึ้น แต่กลับไม่ใช่ กลิ่นเหมือนซ่าปร่าขึ้น ยังดีไม่ถึงขั้นบูด

ส่วนคอขวดต้องดำๆแบบนี้หละถึงจะขลัง อิอิ",07/10/19 02:02,Smell

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,I absolutely adore this fragrance. I just wish it performed as well in warm weather as it did in the cold. The first time I wore it the weather was still cold outside and it had great longevity and silage. I could smell it most of the day. Today I wore it for the second time and for some reason it was gone within an hour. It wasn’t even a skin scent. I did my usual amount of spraying and in the beginning it was so intense my friend jokingly asked if I bathe myself in it. Within an hour neither she nor I could smell it. I'm beginning to wonder if this is one of those scents that doesn't work well in all seasons. That would be a bummer because the warm season is why I bought it. As for the purchase I know it's not a fake because I bought it from a reputable department store. Anyone else have the same issue I'm having? I don't think the bottle is bad ether because as I stated earlier I could smell it fine in the cold weather. I don’t know what to make of this. It is really strange and upsetting because this wasn’t a cheap perfume. I’ll just have to try it again on another warm day and see if it happens again.,05/17/19 20:57,Anamandy
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I’m starting to think Fragrantica ratings of a perfume aren’t accurate, cause based on the ratings of this you’d think it’s pbjectively good. It’s deifnitely NOT, it’s an acquired taste, especially not if you don’t like rose.",03/27/19 07:07,justchillinxo

I love how bright this fragrance is on my skin. It isn't a dour aged rose, but young, bright, and feminine one.

Sillage is about arms length. I can smell it on myself when I wear it for the first hour, and then it settles into most lovely gentle fragrance at the points I've sprayed.",01/18/19 14:45,Laurendhatch

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Been searching for the ""perfect"" rose perfume but it was very difficult to find the right one cause most of the rose fragrances smell like old lady. I tried Roses de Chloe on paper when it was on sale but i thought it just smell like alcohol with a very expensive price tag even after reduced price.

I went home and put the paper on my nightstand, the next day i woke up and sniff the paper aaand... Voila! I have found the ""perfect"" rose that i've been searching for. I bought it on that same day.

Roses de Chloe does take time to reveal its beauty. When i first spray all i get is rose water & alcohol. But the drydown is AMAZING. To me it is really the ""perfect"" one, the rose is really there without that vintage old smell. It is very elegant, feminine, beautiful, sweet and lasting power is quite good for an EDT. It is a beautiful nice girl wearing pastel color feminine dress kind of smell.

But I could not detect it after an hour, which is a huge disappointment considering its price!

EDIT: I stand corrected on the projection and longevity. The bottle I bought was unboxed and I imagine the liquid that was in the tube I guess was oldish. I sprayed it again and it's all good, above average.",11/12/18 07:58,shusha
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I was looking for a perfume for my wedding and was recommended the Chloe EDP. Although I liked it, I found it to be a little too clean/soapy and wanted something a bit warmer for my wedding.

I bought a sample of this after reading reviews and I love it! I've worn it for a couple of days as I wanted to make sure that I was 100% on this. I definitely liked it and I don't get fed up of it, which I often do quite quickly with perfumes.

I didn't consider myself a rose person before but this is just lovely. It smells romantic and can totally imagine myself wearing this on my wedding day.

I do find that I can't smell it fairly soon after application but I don't have a good sense of smell. In any case, I didn't want anything too overpowering for my wedding so this suits me just fine! Some might say it's a little safe for a wedding but that's what I'd like for a special day.

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Before testing this scent, I was already interested due to the high amount of raves on this perfume, I tested it at a store and I immediately was shocked with joy. This is the best version of a rose, picture an elegant rose that somehow has never touched dirt and smells of the citrus trees near by and you've got Chloe Roses De Chloe. It lingers on you for a while of course and this made me happy because the dry down is absolutely beautiful and natural- almost as if you were not wearing any perfume but were laying down in a field of roses. I am extremely impressed and this will be my next purchase and perhaps my new signature scent. The name somehow makes sense in correlation to the scent- I can see a Chloe wearing this, a very elegant lady. The bottle itself reminds me of another dear scent that i recently purchased which is My Burberry Blush, since they both have ribbons on the bottle. You will definitely get compliments wearing this and I can see any age wearing this. Whoever designed the scent (I believe the famous Karl Lagerfeld) put a lot of thoughts to this extravagantly delicate yet powerful scent, It is youthful but not childish.

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Just tested this, and it's way rosier than I expected. But it fades, for me, in 2 hours. Which is odd because it was super strong at first spray. There's a bit of ""grandma"" in this, but it's also an innocent and feminine fragrance. I will enjoy this once I figure out what to do with it. Spray my sheets or me... not sure. I tend to lean toward sexy, heavy and complicated scents or simple but rich roses like Jo Malone Velvet Rose and Oud. This is just simple and fresh.",04/24/18 21:12,lapis1227
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Blind buy for me. This smells very cute: airy, roses, a bit sweet and some musk too. Very clean scent in the rose family of L'Eau d'Issey Florale and Stella McCartney. It smells like a very watered down Montale Roses Musk. It has nothing in common with the original Chloe and the longevity of this fragrance is unbelievably poor. After two hours it's completely gone. Also, this scent is so watery and gentle that it lacks sophistication. I don't feel that great wearing it and I mostly find myself spraying this after a shower or on my sheets. Maybe it'll be a nice refresher when the weather gets extremely hot but right now I'm unimpressed, should've gotten Love Story instead.",04/06/18 06:56,JuliaQueen
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"My favorite Chloe perfume.

In the other versions I smell a ""laundry"" detergent soapy scent that I dislike.

Chloe Rose does have a musky warm tone but not as sharp as the other Chloes IMO.

Very simple perfume overall, I don't see a change in scent over time. Simple rose. But a very nice one. Pure, quality rose, soft, romantic. Feminine but not teenage-perfume like, more elegant.

Perfect for everyday, work, any time of the year.

It does not have enormous sillage just enough, at the end of a day of wearing it it's very light but you do still get a little bit of subtle rose.

Makes me feel happy but also a little bit nostalgic and sad sometimes, I don't know why. Simple beauty.",02/23/18 16:27,just28
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Ordered this after watching a rose farming documentary. I felt nostalgic about my Mom´s fragrant garden roses growing up in our old house...I feel this is a true rose smell. Husband disagrees. You can definitely give it the fearless full spray blast as it is more of a light fragrant body mist that doesn´t last for goodness sake.This became suddenly a familiar smell to me and I recall owning L´Eau de Chloe, the green one with the green bow in 2015. It´s very close to the green Chloe and a similar much weaker version of the Chloe from 2008. Although it is a pretty, feminine and romantic perfume its lightness disappoints. I miss Narciso Rodriguez´Fleur Musc so much right now. So far NC fleur musc is the best Rose smell for me. I may go back to it. But first I want to try Florabotanica out from Balenciaga as I´ve heard it is a good rose smell as well. And I love carnations too. Mom grew carnations too and they smelled divine...",02/16/18 07:03,Rinio

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I have been wearing this little beauty for awhile now, and I must say that it has captivated my heart more and more with every single spray. I wanted to create a memory with it, so I wore this to the hospital when my father had surgery to remove cancer. I associate it now with the fact that he is cancer free. So now when I close my eyes, and inhale deeply, I think ""Healed"".

I have been craving rose scented fragrances a lot lately, and this one is very pretty. On my wrist it's a green litchi rose, but when I spray it in the bend of my arm it is a fruity appley rose. I love it!

Longevity is awesome on me even though it is a toilette. I get 5+ hrs. If you love being enveloped in a rose garden, go out and get this little beauty and add her to your collection. I did...",02/07/18 07:27,mesha2sweet

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"This perfume is a top favorite of mine. I love rose scents, when done right. They nailed this one. It's sophisticated without being old, sexy without being obvious, loud yet very wearable. Super romantic. It's not a jammy rose or an old english rose...It is very much an actual rose garden scent...like you stopped to smell the roses.


I like it better in the Fall/Winter because I prefer something more juicy in the Spring/ Summer. The cedar in this makes it more of a warm scent and is, in my opinion, what rounds this fragrance out perfectly.",01/04/18 08:48,princessmorbux

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I ordered a whole slew of samples online and in a group of 24 or so decants, this is one that spoke to me. Right away, I had to go back online and order a bigger bottle. I am definitely a floral gal and surely love roses, but this scent blew my socks off. She is loud but not screechy, not a soft powdery rose, but a bury your face in rose bush...thorns and all kind of scent. I don't think I can describe it as accurately as I would like, but this rose is not boring. She is not watery or old fashioned. She yells at you a bit, but just to get your attention and make you take a moment to admire her beauty. I do love this so much.",12/27/17 15:25,AntigoneAscending
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I really like the regular Chloé, but this is far better. I smell roses, fruit and a touch of wood. It’s floral, fresh and juicy.

It’s wonderful.",12/17/17 07:14,DaniG83
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,OMG I got a sample of it about a week ago. What a beauty it is. It is far superior than the original Chloè that was released some where in 2011 in Canada.

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Sexy without obvious intension to be sexy
Chloe de roses is very soft and tender. It ´s an amazing sensual scent. Drydown is a heaven. I see a woman who wants to be irresistible and sexy but it´s her secret. Not the first plan. Balance is crucial. Something very sexy like red lipstick, something elegant like right length of skirt, something tender like feminine tender scent, then again something sexy like smart attitude. In other words I see a sexy woman without intention to be sexy. I find it very smart. Smart and sexy. What ´s more?",11/18/17 08:18,Rosepowdery
Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,The theory of smelling like a fresh boquet of red roses turned out to be nicer than really truely smelling of roses. I cannot say about the drydown I didn't last a half hour without scrubbing this off,11/10/17 11:40,winikrose

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"This frag opens into a very green rose with lingering lemon. Hours later I got whiffs of true rose. When I woke up the next morning, I still smelled it on my camisole.

I have had its miniature for a year but couldnt decide if i neened the full bottle or not as the scent is lovely and sweet and so nostalgic. It is a crowd pleaser. The only con is that it does not stay long. It fades away in 2-3hrs max on me. Whenever i buy a perfume for me its longevity is the priority but.. not in this case!!

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"Let me preface by saying that I'm not a fan of rose scents at all...I get flashbacks to the era when everyone in my office was going through a Stella McCartney phase at once. I associate the smell of roses with a heavy, suffocating cheapness. Imagine my surprise when I got a sample of this and fell in love with it! It smells of roses, certainly - but in a very soft, fresh and infinitely wearable way. Several hours after spritzing, I keep sniffing my arms and the fragrance has morphed into a delicious shower clean citrusy rose. I could definitely see this one making it's way into my Spring/Summer rotation. Finally found a rose to love!",09/13/17 18:42,fleurdecouture

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"I'm sitting in a glorious English garden with roses dewy and fresh from a gentle rain all around, ahhh ;) Haha, not really but that's how this delicious blend of floral and fruit smells on my skin! Actually, I'm on my patio with a nice glass of Chardonnay with cutoff jean shorts and a tank top! Oh, and it's 102 here right now! But the freshness of Chloe Roses evokes a fresh, creamy and very feminine vibe of soft flower petals floating around me. This is not a simple rose fragrance. On my skin, it really smells like freshly cut roses on a dewy spring day. The interesting addition of tarragon in the top, adds a lovely balance to the sweet litchi and citrusy lemon--perfect. It may be the cedar in the heart that gives this beautiful scent it's freshness. Also, the fruits chosen here: apple, currant, peach really help to keep this a youthful rose scent. Love that!! Truly, I'm loving this rose Chloe so much right now and haven't yet experienced the warmth of the dry down with that great musky-woods blend. Looking forward to it...and one more sip of Chardonnay. Cheers my friends, this one is a keeper.",07/31/17 15:48,tabitha106

Chloé Roses de Chloé Chloé,"For years I avoided rose scents, as in my mind I pictured geriatric homes heavily scented in rose and lavendar pot pourri. My mother use to work in a nursing home & on occasions when I would visit her work place, the scent of rose & lavendar was everywhere and seemed to hang around like a bad stench.
This is my very first Rose based perfume, which I would never in a million years would have thought of trying, had it not been gifted to me by my then 15 year old niece.
Thank goodness, I absolutely love it! The top note is definitely rose, however it feels bright and fresh and lingers enough for you to enjoy it without feeling overwhelmed. (Note, I am not one to spray heavily on any of my perfumes, as I don't want to smell like I was too lazy to shower and just doused myself in perfume.) I love smelling this scent, it makes me feel calm and relaxed for some reason. Thank heavens for my neice as she has opened my senses to more rose based scents. I am now testing out rose offerings from Diptyque & Serge Lutens which I hope to own one day.",07/25/17 02:16,Smells_Good

One of the freshest, cleanest, most natural rose fragrances I have had the pleasure of smelling in a long time. Slightly powdery but no plastic, dirt, or play-dough here! I applaud Chloe for this one. Sillage and Longevity are fabulous for a floral. Masterfully blended. No single note stands out except the rose, but it’s balanced somehow. Classy, fresh, and romantic.

Also, have you tried Pleats Please L'Eau? It is a rose based soft perfume, ideal for summer, really delicious and, in Brazil, quite inexpensive and with great quality. Pleats Please EdP is a violet based scent, EdT a sweet pea and orange flower one and L'Eau a rose based scent. For me this is the best.

Chloé Le Parfum Chloé,"What a shame...

It’s a basic orange blossom/vanilla blend, way too sweet for my taste. The rose is nowhere to be found, and the whole thing feels crude - not elegant, not refined. A total disappointment for me; how can you mess up a perfume with such a lovely note pyramid?

Chloé Le Parfum Chloé,"I looove this!!! I am a big fan of Chloe and this flanker I do like a lot! I think it has more depth, more of an evening vibe, as Chloe EDP is more versatile, more light and ethereal, Le Parfum is more dense and I imagine this one perfectly as an evening scent. But not like clubbing or anything like that, more like elegant, luxurious events. This is amazing. I do not think this is overly sweet, at first I thought it should have some woody notes for sure as it is truly a more dense and opulent scent, but turns out there is none. Maybe it's the tonka note. Overall, the vanilla and tonka do not make this scent overly obnoxious and offensively sweet, I honestly found this very luxurious, high class perfume if you can call it that way.
Beautiful longevity and projection, Stays a long time, even till next day and lingers in the air. Love it! No matter what generation you are, you are young or in your elder years, I can totally imagine this perfume on all age groups!",11/01/25 07:12,nepria
Chloé Le Parfum Chloé,"Pretty, easy going rose scent. Nice but forgettable. The orange blossom note adds a slight bitter, green touch, but the dry down is woody, powdery and vanillic. It’s less bright and floral than the other flankers, and goes into a more generic rose/orange blossom/vanilla direction. It’s also less sweeter than the OG Chloe, which I don’t like about it.

Nothing to write home about really, it is simple, linear, clean and feminine. I like it, but way less than the OG or the Absolu versions, so I won't get a full bottle. I have many scents with a similar profile and to me personally Chloe Le Parfum 2025 is kinda boring and uninspiring! And massively overpriced for the average performance..",10/23/25 03:14,Maya lilac
Chloé Le Parfum Chloé,"From someone who is not so much into floral scent, I love this flanker! At first spray, I could smell the Chloe DNA in it, but it was a tad bit heavier and less sweet on my skin. After the dried down... holy molly macaroni! The vanilla started to pick up, and it turned powdery on me (which I love). I also smelled a mixture of citric and herbal scents that lingered for the rest of the day. I could even smell it the next morning!
Definitely a fragrance to go during my cold days!",10/17/25 01:38,WSparrow
Chloé Le Parfum Chloé,"The first five minutes or so was very annoying, maybe because of the sharpness of the orange flowers.

Chloé Le Parfum Chloé,"I’ve always liked the Chloe fragrance dna but to me they are all basically the same and I’ve never really smelled one that I really wanted. Reading the reviews below didn’t really spur me on to buy this particular one but strangely enough I was enticed to buy the 10ml version. This definitely has the aforementioned Chloe dna but has a Delina vibe going on, but it feels & smells more timeless, a rose that is not too juvenile or too old, very classy. I’ve put on one spray and it projects nicely, longevity is also pretty good. Husband LOVES it, he’s used to me wearing something different pretty much all the time and hardly ever compliments me, but this is just such a pleasing and uncomplicated scent that it really spoke to him 😊. Is it really original? No. If you have any of the other Chloe frags would you need this one as well? Nooo. But if you like the dna but never felt compelled to actually buy one, try this one, I bet it will not disappoint.",09/28/25 08:35,Sjess
Chloé Le Parfum Chloé,"The first minutes are screechy, pungent, odd—pretty bad. So bad that I wondered, why, oh why, did this perfume ever get the green light to be released? With thousands of new launches every year, how could they make such a wasteful move? Didn’t they want to create something attractive? Didn’t they want to sell more bottles?

More or less at the same time, I tested a few other perfumes on my skin and then left home. After about 20 minutes, while driving, I suddenly found myself surrounded by a juicy, sensual cloud. At first, I didn’t know which of the 4–5 perfumes was the source of such gorgeousness. But my memory kicked in, and in less than a minute I remembered exactly which spot I had sprayed it on. It was Chloe Le Parfum—the very one with the worst opening of them all.

This fruity, flowery bloom was such a surprise that I went straight to the nearest shopping center to test it again, more thoroughly. I wanted to wear it fully—on the neck, behind the ears, in the hair—to feel it better and make sure it was really this one and not another.

The fruity-sweet molecules form a jammy, rich accord with the woody-musk notes, reminiscent of Xerjoff Muse. The drydown, however, is drier, less spectacular, with too much white amber for my taste and not enough juiciness. I’m on the fence—but for those few hours of heart notes, I might actually consider it the best release of 2025 so far.",09/23/25 08:08,jeanin
Chloé Le Parfum Chloé,"I recently added Chloe Le Parfum to my collection.
For me, Chloe Le Parfum is a more mature version of Chloe. Or rather, it's like a combo of Chloe Intense and Chloe Lumineuse. More perfect and round. With just a hint of fruity sweetness and vanilla.
On my skin, the tonka bean note stands out, and together with the Chloe rose, they make the scent subtle and elegant.

I have Chloe Intense, and the intensity of the raspberry annoys me – it's too childish, sweet, and girly. Lumineuse was even worse – I could only smell on my skin a plastic, artificial vanilla all the time. I had to give it to my sister because I couldn't stand it. Surprisingly, it smells completely different on her – joyful and optimistic.

So, Chloe Le Parfum is THE version of Chloe for fall and winter. It has all my favorites notes – tonka bean, orange blossom, and rose. (for spring and summer - Chloe Naturelle or Naturelle Intense)

I'm going to Venice this fall, and this scent will be perfect company.",09/17/25 23:30,ankaa

Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"I asked for this perfume (un-sniffed) for Christmas when it first came out. Tried it on and enjoyed the sweetness of the dates and the jasmine. I then put it away and tried wearing it in autumn/winter but found it overpowering and sickening. I have very frequent migraine attacks that mess with my sense of smell, and this was one that I really couldn't stand around an attack. Nevertheless, I left it til the heat of summer, and I was so glad I did. The longevity was amazing for my skin, 8 or so hours. I am no longer able to discern a lot of the specific notes in a frag, but again the sweetness of this really hits beautifully for me on a hot day. Another win by Chloe 🩷",09/30/25 06:35,amber82
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"FULL BOTTLE WORTHY. One of the best fruit scents I’ve ever smelled. It’s a sweet, creamy, resinous, fruity-floral. Slight tropical vibe. Well blended. Just as floral as it is fruity, but there’s a brilliant bite to it that propels the fruit to the forefront. It’s more peach than plum on my skin. Brings peach Jolly Ranchers to mind. I also get the deliciousness of a freshly lit cigar from it. Candied jasmine, too. Could pass for a tart peach flanker of ROOM1015 Jasmine Freak. Haven’t smelled all that much from the house of Chloe, but this is my favorite yet. So good I can’t imagine it gets any better. Gorgeous and addicting. I want it.

Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"We’re witnessing a beautiful evolution in the Chloé line - a gradual shift in notes toward the ""Egyptian"" theme that eventually lands us in Nuit d’Égypte. It’s like a slow gradient, and I have to say, it’s a really interesting concept the house has developed.

I’m usually not a fan of flankers. But Chloé is one of the very few brands that actually do them well. Not too many, and when they release one, it makes sense. Like it’s part of a broader narrative, not just another random spin-off. I enjoyed both Naturelle and Naturelle Intense. The Intense version is a bit sweeter and woodier, but ultimately, they share the same genetics. Very pretty. Very well done.",07/05/25 05:55,MetaMystic

Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"Chloe Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense starts bright with a tangy mirabelle and fresh pear. This is quickly overtaken by sweet dates (actually on my skin it feels more like honey). The jasmine note here is rendered creamy by another white flower, probably tiara, gardenia or maybe tuberose. The base has oak moss way in the background (unlike the original Nomade), the patchouli is almost nonexistent. What I get most, on my skin, is a powdery smooth wood in the dry down. It is an elegant scent in an elegant flacon but unfortunately, it has poor performance, the name should have stopped before the Intense part.
Although I LOVE white flowers, I prefer the OG to this flanker. It’s more unique.",05/26/25 04:12,Tinabill
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"I am a fan of Chloé, many thanks for the nice and clean perfumes they make, but I'm wondering what's going on with those Nomade flankers...
They are overly sweet and flat and for Nomade jasmin intense, I don't know what I'm smelling. It's like jasmine sprinkled with vanilla in some hot water and with a big splash of honey.

It would be a nice concept of a perfume but it's not at all charming. It reminds me of a jasmine roll-on I once bought and was bored of it after one week.

I'll finish my 5ml sample that I had to pay for, because I appreciate the natural side of it and the fact that there's no trace of alcohol. And I don't mind it's lack of projection, a perfume that doesn't tire the senses.

I guess it'll stay 2 years on the shelves (if they distribute it in shops and not only online as I see it's the case).

I wish Chloé would focus on creating a new solid perfume because they only have 2 remaining pillars : Chloé signature and Nomade.",05/21/25 10:47,Elenad
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"I do enjoy sweet perfumes, but this one takes sweetness to an entirely different level. Sometimes, less is more and I truly wish this fragrance embraced that philosophy. Instead, it comes across as overwhelmingly sweet, and not in a charming gourmand way, but rather in a cloying, almost excessive manner.

The opening is particularly sharp likely due to the combination of dates and jasmine, which overpower everything else and leave the remaining notes lost in the background. I do get a trace of sandalwood as it dries down, but by then, the sweetness has already worn me out.

I’m a huge admirer of the original Nomade … it’s a scent I love to the core. But unfortunately, none of the flankers have lived up to it for me. I do own the Egypt version, which feels far more balanced. This one, sadly, just didn’t work for me.

Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"If you’re a fan of jasmine & white florals, this is a must have for your collection.

This is personally my signature scent. In the warmer months the pear & mirabelle notes are bright & the vanilla is delightfully creamy. In the winter months the date, sandalwood & okamoss is prominent on me and is a “sticky date pudding” type aroma. Both warm and cool the jasmine & freesia comes through heady & creamy, but also transitions the complexity & seasonal mutability.

It is not a scent appropriate for people who strongly dislike white florals. But this scent I find a delight all year round, day or night. I’m often complimented & asked what scent am I wearing. A somewhat whimsical part of me thinks there’s a signature fragrance for everyone, where they can wear it anytime of day or year and it just compliments their personal chemistry & for me I’ve found it with this one. This pure enjoyment that I have & multiple compliments I receive may make me bias in my review.

I remember the first day I tried it as a tester. My husband (fiancé at the time) would not stop saying how good I smelled & he asked me to wear it on our wedding day. It’s definitely a scent that would have the longevity and the right balance for a wedding fragrance",04/18/25 05:44,HopeWright
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"I have a 1oz of the regular nomad and a 1.6oz this one. And the regular is sweet fruity light easy.

Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"I must admit, I had no prior interest in the Chloé Nomade line, but this version completely changed my perspective. Nomade Jasmin Naturelle Intense is a stunning fragrance that captivated me easily.

The jasmine here is fresh, lush, and radiant , balanced beautifully by a sweet, balsamic base that adds warmth and depth. Unlike many mainstream designer fragrances, this one stands out with its refined quality and elegance.

It clings to my skin all day, leaving a soft, inviting trail with every whiff. Each encounter with its scent lifts my mood and brings a sense of joy.

If you love jasmine and crave something warm and sophisticated, this one is absolutely worth experiencing.",01/08/25 11:53,dyrdkk
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"I wanted to get Nomade Naturelle EDP which lacks the patch and pear - both not safe notes with me, but a review described a smoky scent like burning wood and I was hesitant to drop the money on it. Dates as a note is weird, sometimes sour like ambroxan as in DUA Ajwa Dates or sour-balsamic and slightly smoky as in DUA Desert Mirage. I hadn't realized that dates are sour as a note.

So I got DUA's version called Intense Natural Jasmine Voyage. It is missing some notes, the mirabelle, freesia and oakmoss. It is an indolic jasmine scent with a VERY balsamic quality making it perfectly oriental, triggering vivid visuals in my brain of hot deserts and refreshing oases. The pear makes it sour and slightly spicy as in salty and the dates add the sour like ambroxan and almost smoky effect but no actual burning scent or obnoxiously smoky - I despise smoky scents. The dates note is rather a vanilla-syrupy slightly 'smoky' sour element in it, but quite dry too and the patchouli adds some subtle earthiness without being obnoxious. The vanilla in conjunction with the dates note is giving the syrupy balsamic vein that is almost boozy. For 21 bux I am not complaining, it's very nice, quite addicting if you are into mysterious oriental warm aromatic jasmine scents with a refreshing floral essence. It also doesn't smell masculine maybe as it lacks the oakmoss, even though I love oakmoss and all mossy scents even the manly ones. I am a fan of the OG Nomade btw, but I needed something new cuz I get bored too easily. In fact it reminds me of DUA Desert Mirage which is kinda like Armani Si due to being sour with the cassis and ambroxan, without the leathery obnoxious cistus and the rose. This is smoother than Armani Si, even though it is also sour, but much better, no cigarette smell from this, also not ambery sour as BBW Ivory Cashmere and I get sour cigarette vibes from that one too. So this is a total winner for me.",01/05/25 23:38,sassa7
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"To be honest I have no idea whether I love this perfume or not at all.

I have a small test bottle and it is so very sticky sweet, cloying and maybe even a little tacky. The scent is huge on me and it feels thick and heavy, think of warm languid thighs on an overly hot summer evening. At times, the smell is a little nauseating, overwhelming and suffocating but at the same time addictive, incredibly addictive. Maybe it's a bit of sexiness in a bottle, still noticeable and sticking on the body.

Thus I put it on my wishlist anyway (grin)",12/26/24 11:07,Sneeuw

Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"I recently smelled Chloé Nomade Jasmine Naturelle and the Intense version back to back and I'm not sure which one I love more. They were a lot similar, only I find this one a little sweeter and overall bolder. They gave me a tester paper, and two days later the paper still smells like it was just sprayed on. But I guess it's a different story when it comes to our bodies lol. Anyway, it's not a fragrance I would choose in my late 20s, I find it more of a 35-40s because it's still floral, sweet, feminine, a fragrance for a younger person, but it's a smell you choose when you change perspectives a little and want to get away from the overly girly vibes. If that's your vibe go for it, everyone will stop and admire believe me. BUT, also go and test the EDP version, it's worth it.",11/27/24 01:50,In_love_like_a_rose

Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"Blind Buy experience: This stuff is goooood!! I'm a lover of tropical scents. Beachy, summery scents are my thing. Everyone seems to love their wintertime scents and I'm all about the summer fragrances and I have my fair share of them. I live in the desert, so I get plenty of use for them and not so much use for fall/winter scents. With that being said, I had to come back here to look at the pyramid because I don't recall tiare, frangipani, or coconut being in this one, but it smells beachy, and I love that! It's a smooth, creamy jasmine, a very classy take on this style of perfumery. I suppose it's just the combination of mirabelle, jasmine, dates, pear, and freesia that's doing it for me. This is blended so well, none of the notes are dominant and the base is there just to support the heart and top to provide longevity and stability.

The patchouli is almost undetectable here so if you're not a patch fan, fear not. The oakmoss complements the scent to provide some class with a nice earthy touch. I would have never known there were dates in this had I not come here, nothing like the dates in Kamrah. I suppose they are used for sweetness and an earthy, fruitiness since the whole nomad line is about elegant earthiness. I just keep thinking when I smell this, I smell class. It's classy, but also youthful, feminine, and sexy. Not easy to do all of those at once, but they pulled it off here and I say kudos! I say this is good for anyone 25+. It might be a bit too sweet for women over 70, but if you like sweet fragrances and you're over 70, you do you! I'm just thinking about the women I know over 70 and I know most of them are not big fans of overly sweet perfumes. By no means is this overly sweet, at least for me, but it definitely has that sweetness of a floral/fruity fragrance.

I love this one. I keep going back to smell my hand! Definitely blind buy safe, as long as you don't have an aversion to tropical florals because that's what this scent is. It's jasmine disguised as frangipani here!",04/25/24 13:46,Blossomlove

Realistic, pollen-y jasmine cut from the bush, with a slight dash of honey in the back. Slightly church-y, earthly and evocative of opulent, dark, thick chestnut honey or dates. Think a jar of dates in a western church full of white wedding flowers. 💮🍯⛪🍵 💮

It smells really warm and comforting, like being out in the sun. It's really an absolutely stunning fragrance with fantastic longevity. It smells both bright and solar and dark and exotic (from the Egyptian jasmine) at the same time. It also gets an exotic flair from the spices that come a bit after the top notes settle down.

This was an impulsive acquisition 😅. I went to the store wanting to try D&G the only one intense and Burberry Godess but neither one convinced me enough to buy them. Of all the designer perfumes the Chloe Nomade bottles caught my eye and I randomly picked this one. OMG it was love at first sniff. Very sweet, potent and floral. Sillage and longevity are amazing for a designer perfume. The initial sweet note remains throughout and even the drydown on my skin smells more sweet than floral which I love.

Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"OMG Hear me out... this is the designer sibling of Amouage Guidance. They are quite similar (i am literally smelling them both now), not identical, but more like cousins. They share similar notes: pear in the top notes, jasmine in the middle notes (here, dates add sweetness, while in Amouage, it's osmanthus), and sandalwood and vanilla in the base. If you don't have the budget for Amouage, go for this one; they give off exactly same vibe. I still think Amouage is more complex, but remove the nuts, saffron, and Labdanum, and it becomes Chloe Nomade. To be honest, I even prefer Chloe because Guidance, with hazelnuts in top nots, has this rotting, spoiled smell that Chloe doesn't have.

By the way, out of all the designer perfumes I've tried, these are among the few I adore (maybe 3-4 that deserve my approval out there). They are not linear and quite complex in a non-offensive way. Definitely worse its money.",12/15/23 08:16,annamal

In the cooler weather I can smell the pear and the dates for the first time and they make for quite an addictive combination. I cannot smell the Nomade DNA at all, but I it has that Chloe trademark of taking something sweet and feminine and making it grown-up at the same time. My sister used to love Dior Addict and I'm thinking she would like this as a more mellow, sophisticated vanilla/white floral scent.",12/12/23 03:35,bergamot81
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"I feel like it will become my new trick pick. Such a beautiful perfume. Firstly, the pear-floral mixture is so calming and unique. After 10-20 min the beautiful sweet part begins, where it smells like tea with sweet spices or Apfelstrudel. I feel like wearing it every season, since the jasmine and light pear would fit hot seasons too. At the end, there is a nice transition from pear to vanilla, reminding of the ice cream that’s served together with the Apfelstrudel. One spray lasted almost 8h on my skin. My boyfriend hates perfumes and gets headaches even from the most natural smelling ones, but this one and Coffee Break from MMM are the only ones that he likes, so definitely also a sign for FB for me.

I feel like this perfume is perfect to wear for calm/cozy moments or when you want to feel like that. I imagine it fitting every age and being worn by a girl/woman in cozy and soft neutral clothes. Soft sweaters in winter and flowing very light linen or satin in summer. The clothes that give a delightful feeling on skin, same as this perfume gives you a charming feeling when wearing it.

Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"Very pleasant and sensual. It is definitely sweet but in a mature way. I think it's the dates note here. Dates add sweetness but in a dark and sultry way. The scent is certainly nice but I can barely recognize the Nomade DNA here. If anything, this feels somewhat close to Supreme Bouquet by YSL if you take away the tuberose and amp up the jasmine, and even more similar to each other on the dry down. I prefer the original Nomade or Nomade Absolu over this, but I am biased as I prefer the classic chypre profile. Nomade and Nomade Absolu are closer to a classic chypre than this one. Regardless, this is a grown, intimate and poised scent that I think everybody should like on themselves and others. I do feel that this could've been a starter of Chloe's new fragrance line instead of a flanker.",10/14/23 09:00,dexilio
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"Beyond testing Nomade Naturelle once in store, Jasmin Naturel Intense was the first flanker in the line that really caught my eye. I think if you already own Nomade Naturelle, then this would be very redundant for you as the differences are pretty minor. However, I personally think the changes made here improve on the original. I like the addition of pear and the slightly amped up florals.

While the jasmine note is elevated vs the original this is not really a Jasmin floral fragrance despite the name. If you come in expecting a very heady and indolic jasmine, I think you'll be disappointed. That's not this fragrance. It's also not a true gourmand but the dates are still the real star of this show. The overall effect very much gives spiced date bread in big wide pastures. I don't know how to explain it but this perfume speaks to the former horse girl in my soul. (Though there is absolutely nothing animalic about this. I'd be curious if other people who have spent time around horses get the same feeling.)

Solid performance of about 5-6 hours before it starts to really fade. I really enjoy this perfume and it's been getting a lot of wear recently both casually and at work. I will say though, when I asked my husband his opinion on this he told me he thought it smelled like the candle/home goods section of a Marshalls. So you know, YMMV. He's not entirely wrong, I can kind of see the spiced Yankee candle comparisons but it doesn't diminish the fact that I'm into this perfume and I continue to reach for it frequently. At the rate I am going through my 30 ml, it may be full bottle worthy for me. Solid designer launch from Chloe.",10/10/23 10:29,Einfinken

The original Nomade edp is way stronger than this. this is practically a skin scent. It doesn't remind me of the the original Nomade at all, but it is very nice. I have a big bottle of the original and the smallest bottle of this, and I think it's the exact right amount. I like it, I don't love it. The lack of strength and longevity is inexcusable if the word intense is in the name.",10/06/23 12:54,Veronika95
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"INSANE! The beginning opens up like the classic Nomade but after 15 minutes it turns into the most beautiful sweet jasmine scent. I dont know if I can compare it to jasmine candy, jasmine jelly or date paste infused with jasmine (it is sweet but not THAT sweet).

Absolutely stunning!!!!",09/12/23 04:27,lmnsvgz
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"A much sweeter fruitier take on Nomade absolu which I own. I feel like this is a typical designer dna, a pleasant daytime floral but overall underwhelming and lacks the uniqueness of the original. Additionally, the performance is severely lacking, not impressed!",09/07/23 11:47,PerfumePixie87
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,it reminds me of dior addict,08/14/23 02:21,Nourhanamer
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,This fragrance is so beautiful and feminine.. it’s like a warm hug in a garden on a spring day. I smelt this while browsing a perfume shop and I couldn’t stop thinking about it - so I came back after half an hour and bought a whole bottle.,08/07/23 22:30,Phbe
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"It's super similar to nomade naturelle which is a fav. Having both would be redundant but I'm glad I have a 30ml because I'm partial to a Jasmine note. There's a dryness of nomade that I adore. It reminds me of philosykos that way.

Edit: testing nomade naturelle and jasmin naturel side by side, I much prefer nomade naturelle. Creamier, stronger date note and the pear note in jasmin feels a bit artificial and honestly a bit screechy compared to the original. Jasmin seems to project more.",08/05/23 01:08,UGLYLUXE
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"I like this one! For me, the opening is quite sharp so I really have to be in the mood for it, otherwise I'll get a headache unfortunately. But I love the warm and creamy vanilla dry down so I still wear this, especially on cooler days!",07/25/23 01:48,elinlinnea
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"I'm a bit surprised- I enjoyed the opening of pear and jasmine, and it stayed a while, almost convincing me that I'd found something to adore. However, the dry down was not as nose catching- rather creamy vanilla, dates and freesia, I could no longer detect the jasmine note.",06/19/23 22:02,Lotte_Liese
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"I’ve never smelled the original naturel so I can’t compare but I have all the other nomades which all offer something different… it’s heavy on the jasmin as the name suggests… this perfume is sweet I like it if I’m in the mood…I actually layered this with the nomade absolute to tone down the sweetness… they worked well together! And I must add this perfume lasts a long time on my skin… after testing this out longer… the dry down is amazing … the woody creamy vanilla insency jasmine comes through after the hit of initial floral jasmine… tropical vibes too

Edit: I decided to get the naturel original to compare… they are 95 percent similar… I’d say original just less Jasmin honestly and maybe the Jasmin intense a tad sweeter? Not enough of a difference to have both honestly. If I really search for the patchouli in the intense I can find it but it’s not that noticeable to me! But when comparing the two I can tell the Jasmine version is a little more sharp from that note possibly",06/17/23 10:00,Casbag11
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"If Juicy Couture and Roberto Cavalli for Her had a child, it would be this fragrance. It has a hint of chewing gum that bothers me, and on my skin, the vanilla warms up the fragrance a lot. It's not for me.",06/13/23 06:13,Lilium86
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,Hype train!,06/05/23 04:57,Chesco
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"I was on the fence about the OG of this line, but this one is a definite dislike.
I don't like how the intensified jasmine combines with the other notes.
This smells bitter instead of smokey like the OG. The date note is much stronger here too, and not in a good way.
On my skin this fragrance smells like acrid wine.",06/04/23 08:09,cookygirl
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"I just can't stop sniffing. Creaminess of the dates takes a lead in this journey, followed by jasmine by his side such a combo. I never love creamy jasmine until I try this. Somehow I can't smell any pear or mirabelle.The sillage is not bad, durability also okay. Very nice to wear in winter/autumn. Expensive smell, elegant but in modern way. Suitable for all ages I think. Full bottle? Yes!

PS : I just found incense smell on the dry down, adding an oriental/dark vibes. Love it!",05/17/23 14:28,reginasiena
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"Beautiful if you love sweet, woody, jasmines. I don't agree that this smells exactly like the Nomade Naturelle. The DNA is the same of course, but the jasmine is DEFINITELY the star in this. Just lovely overall. It's a bit sweet for my personal taste, but I love layering it on top of the Nomade EDP or EDT.",05/17/23 09:05,thecellophaneflower
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,I am on my second bottle of the OG Naturelle and have already purchased a 3rd because I heard it’s discontinued. This Jasmine version isn’t as strong on me. I didn’t get those glorious wafts of creaminess. It wouldn’t be a replacement for the OG in my opinion.,05/13/23 01:01,CRiche
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"Received a tester. First impression soft creamy coconutty. Then jasmine ish wood in the background. Would I buy FB, probably not. Its not strong enough for me. It's a nice summer scent .",05/11/23 14:21,Miss Dolittle
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,I agree this smells 95% like the OG nomade Naturelle. Just has a slight floral tinge which I don’t love here - I much prefer the original.,04/15/23 01:12,LenoreHolly
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"Absolutely gorgeous, fluffy, warm sweetness accompanied by sandalwood
Smells expensive and unlike anything I know
Not as floral as I expected, a lot more sweet and musky.
Definitely try before you buy",04/14/23 15:40,Edemay
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"I've received a sample and I do not like it.
There's something in the dry down that I actually hate (reminds me of an ashtray)
But it's really elegant, feminine and well blended.",04/10/23 06:45,Kuty22
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,Very good I recive a sample and I purchased full size. It’s soft delicate jasmin but it stay a long time. And I like to layer it with Ylang in Gold Nectar ❤️❤️❤️,04/05/23 09:52,Claudiacp
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"Very earthy, just like the others in this line...I think Im just not a fan :) they all smell so masculine on me. I tried to scrub it off my skin with two different soaps and it still stays on my skin.",04/01/23 07:22,Hannehoney
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"This is beautiful! I get a very natural jasmine. It’s fresh and simple but very well done. The jasmine is definitely dominant here, i don’t get much of the other notes with the exception of a soft touch of mirabelle and a bit of dates. It smells a bit earthy and very relaxing. It’s not really sweet, it’s more floral. It’s pleasant and timeless. I am positively surprised! And the bottle is pretty too. Thumbs up!",03/17/23 03:05,raiza1990
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"Why is tuberose omitted from the list of notes? To me, this fragrance (regardless of its pointless name) actually smells like tuberose (of the sweet-bubblegummy variety). The rest of the notes, jasmine included, only play supporting roles.",03/12/23 11:10,LadyIva
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"I'm in love with this version. The original Nomade Naturelle smells strongly of incense on my skin, it's still very good but this one is much sweeter and I prefer it on me. I love it and I can't stop smelling it.",03/08/23 11:29,Selcare
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"I feel like this version has a lot more dates to it! It sits so pretty on my skin, it smells yummy, fresh and effortless. Jasmine also suits really well there. Its performance tho, is disappointing. Lasted for around 3 hours on me and had to reapply after this time. I would expect more from it.",03/08/23 08:01,YuXinSun
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,"Smells exactly as the eau Naturelle original. I would choose the original, also because a coconutty-creamy note that makes it delicious, and this flanker is more fruity than creamy.
Stick with the original Nomade eau naturelle!",02/21/23 11:01,Mirtilla
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Intense Chloé,This smells almost exactly like Nomade Naturelle Eau de Parfum? It's delicious but I'm a bit confused,02/06/23 11:38,SaraKa
Love Chloé,"I will never forget this scent. Never. I don't understand how you can discount such a magnificently beatiful frangrance. Love by Chloe was ahead of time before gourmand took the perfume scene. Love was more modern than Dune or J'dore by Dior, Love was more sophisticated, complex than La Vie Est Belle. It was powdery, floral. It was so warm, musky but also fresh.",,chaneldior
Love Chloé,"I have just recently started my perfume journey because I am on a quest to find a perfume that smells like a hug with my mom: covergirl pressed powder foundation, clean laundry, coffee, and love. My mom’s fragrance is Clinique Happy. This perfume is a hug in a bottle, and as close to a hug from her as possible.

It is feminine, clean, comforting and sweet. The florals add a beautiful complexity that settles into the powder. It’s just lovely.

I had to blind buy a 15 ml, but I was certain this would be the one. It was. Such a beautiful fragrance, I hope I can find a larger bottle someday.",10/22/25 16:54,lizaroma

Love Chloé,"I still have a little bit left in my bottle. 🥲💖
Some say it's a spring floral and i can totally understand that, considering the notes.
But to me this will always be a crisp autumn 🍁🍂night with twinkling lights✨️ and going out in the evening fragrance. Also all the -ber month festive season vibes.
It's magical💫 and incredibly uplifting.
By far the prettiest most loved fragrance i've ever known and had the privilege to own. (This AND the intense)",09/14/25 13:27,Parfluive
Love Chloé,"Just blind bought this on Mercari for $16 (the travel size)!!! I hope it's as beautiful as everyone says.

EDIT: I was a little disappointed tbh, I don't hate it but it's just not giving what I was hoping it would.. I love powdery perfumes but this was a bit too straight forward baby powder to my nose with nothing blended into it to make it sensual.",09/11/25 15:49,PaigeBanghart

Why Chloé did discontinue this amazing fragrance?🫠
So unrespectful to the customers!
This is a timeless kind of fragrance, no point to take out of market.",06/08/25 19:44,rziotti
Love Chloé,"Heaven for powdery floral enjoyers. Feminine, nostalgic, magical. It’s like a soft fairy dust, like a comforting dream, like a hug from a loved one.
It’s so sad seeing such beauties being discontinued. Why do they break our bonds with better past, I will never understand.",05/27/25 12:46,Punika
Love Chloé,"One of THE most beautiful fragrances I have ever worn in my entire life. It has a strong element of nostalgia, like something from my childhood. You won't smell anything prettier than this scent. Sweet lilacs and all it's sweet best friends, so, so pretty.",05/14/25 08:17,DollyMix
Love Chloé,"I love to sniff Love from up close on my skin. The purple flower-y nuances in all of their glory and rice come through and it feels complex, elegant and warm. However, most people who smell this fragrance in the air as it projects off of my body tell me I smell like straight-up baby powder; perhaps a novice association pertaining to the ultra powerdiness of Love. While I do love it to pieces for personal use, I rarely wear it out in public and never really have. It's an evening or bedtime scent mostly. One that I use to feel comforted and relaxed. Love Intense and Love Eau Florale are a bit more palatable due to their additional notes that tame or tone the powder down. But Love the og will always have a special place in my heart. I don't think a suitable replacement exists. It is one-of-a kind and a crying shame they stopped making this line of beauties. I cherish my 2.5 oz. bottle and will likely have it for many years to come.",05/07/25 10:54,Swedelish
Love Chloé,"I've tested this in various phases of my perfume journey / life. Always hits different. Ten years ago it felt synthetic, powdery, dated. Now it feels very much springtime fresh daywear. A good complex spring purple floral with plenty of powderiness from the rice and iris. It's just a touch on the dry side for me, a touch waxy, a little violet-y even though I see no violets. I think If I did pick a perfume in this genre it would be a bit more photorealistic floral, and a touch more sweet. This leans more on the waxy dry make up bag but still spring floral style powdery perfume. I do like it, and interesting how my perception of it changes each time i try it.",04/19/25 07:22,Cherry_Darling
Love Chloé,"I miss this perfume whenever I stop using it, no other fragrance made me feel this way thank god they sell the dupe in Türkiye, whenever I spray I feel like a ballerina in nutcracker, almost like tinkerbell sprinkles fairy dust on you...",04/18/25 12:35,dandeli0n

Love Chloé,"Why on earth did they discontinue this?
There is no logic whatsoever in perfume houses discontinuing their most loved scents. I just dont get it🤷🏼♀️",01/19/25 14:41,saramariah
Love Chloé,"Uber feminine, retro leaning (but somehow still modern) powdery floral. The florals are sweet and intense, with an almost honeyed facet that shines through the opening and lasts until the far drydown. It also definitely has an expensive make-up-adjacent smell (think vintage rice powder). Smells sophisticated but it's not exactly subtle - I often find it a bit too screechy and overbearing, especially for the first couple hours. It has excellent sillage and staying power (at least 8 hours on my skin). Even though it's only a mild like and not a love for me, I can't see why Chloe discontinued it, as it does strike me as the ultimate crowd pleaser fragrance, and I always imagined it was a big seller.",01/14/25 02:47,amelia.g
Love Chloé,"This is an undoubtedly floral scent that, if you can bear the first 20 minutes, opens up into a soapy and clean smell. Long-lasting and sophisticated. Some moments, it feels sweet, other moments it feels fresh and even slightly bitter. Musky and powdery. One of those smells that feels comforting in any season.Too bad it was discontinued.",01/11/25 11:30,Leskin
Love Chloé,"I love Powder Flowers and used to wear it religiously and to my nose it does not smell like Love. I would say only the initial blast is very slightly (30%) reminiscent of.

Love Chloé,That’s nice! Slightly soapy and vintage but still a very lovely (and quite realistic) scent of lilac (which is not a very popular note in perfumery at the moment). Light yet long-lasting purple flowers.,11/01/24 07:21,Scent.guide
Love Chloé,"For those who are looking for an alternative I suggest go try Jours Heureux 2022 by Bienaimé!

Love Chloé,"Oh my god this was my signature scent and I loved it SO MUCH!
Again a super nice fragrance where I simply don't understand why they discountinued it.
I tried to find anything similar, dupes etc but no luck.

This is the happiest powdery sweet fragrance I have ever tried. It is powdery without being lipsticky (which I hate) and without being grandma-ish. This perfume made me smile everytime I smelled it. It is comforting, feminine, soft, warm, floral, kind. I wish they bring it back.

Update: I found a dupe that is actually quite nice - if you live in Europe, you might want to check out the PURE No. 414 fragrance (where I live they are available on parfum e-shop). It is not exactly the same but close enough to give me the nostalgic comfort.",09/20/24 12:03,Nekomimikan

Edit 2025: I came across another user who said Sopranissima by Luciano Soprani was the closest to Love, Chloe that she has found. I decided to give it a shot since Fragrance Net has it for an extremely affordable price. Although the performance is equivalent to a body mist, the delicate purple floral note is nearly spot on. I have tried several dupes and I prefer this over them all.",07/22/24 13:20,acs1994
Love Chloé,"My wife's favourite one, I would say love or hate perfume, I know several women that can't stand it at all and many of them who would give fortune for it, I like that soapy-flowery vibe it gives and great performances of course, it lasts and projects whole day.",07/05/24 02:29,StevenBat

Love Chloé,"Love, Chloe perfume is a magical elixir. I recall the first time I smelled it in a Sephora upon its release, not expecting much. I consider the bottle somewhat underwhelming. However, that first sniff was pure olfactory wonderment. Just pure rice powder and flowers, like diving into a cloud of uncompromising femininity. The projection and lasting power are also remarkable. Such a shame that Chloe discontinued it, as I have met so many people that consider it a favorite and/or holy grail. Though I tend to love every fragrance that Chloe releases, none come close to my passionate affair with Love, Chloe. A few years ago I bought the closest dupe on the market, Phyllis by Pull & Bear (also discontinued now). That is a good one as well, though it has a zing or Sprite-like carbonation to it that makes it less powdery. If they re-released Love, Chloe - I would instantly buy 20 bottles and sell the majority of the rest of my collection. I love it that much.",04/09/24 13:33,EauDeLa
Love Chloé,"I was curious, and tried to find my big cousin’s perfume from my childhood memories. However it was there, but it wasn’t the same.

Love Chloé,"Like so many others, I was gutted when they discontinued this fragrance. It is special, unique, exhilarating, refreshing, and strong. I will share a secret, as I know many in the comments are pining over this scent: I went to the Chloé flagship store on Greene Street in NYC and had a nice convo with a sales associate, when she mentioned that if you ask for it at that location, they may be able to do something!! Good luck <3",03/27/24 14:59,Catherine Fairchild

Love Chloé,"I don’t get any of the pink pepper, just powdery goodness, and some rice. It’s nice, but I don’t really get why it’s so hyped up. I got a partially full 30 ml bottle second hand last year and I haven’t used much, but the few times I have, I’ve gotten compliments. It’s so weird when that happens; you’re not really into a perfume, but people around you think you smell amazing.
Lasts 6-8 hrs and projects well.",01/05/24 11:09,Frontandscenter
Love Chloé,"One of my favourite Chloe perfumes. Layering it with Boucheron Iris (in the purple bottle) became a signature scent for me for some time and got compliments on it. Very elegant and classy.

I don't know why Chloe discontinued this gem though (Whyyyy??!!). When it got discontinued I was lucky to buy a bottle but had to pay a hefty price for it!!!",01/05/24 01:17,Moonami
Love Chloé,"This one is very special. Powdery, delicate, very elegant scent, the one I used to wear to feel cozy.. I discovered this fragrance during a very bumpy and sad time in my life. And it brought me a lot of comfort.

Raquek Zimmerman wears camel clothes in this perfume video which is how I imagine a woman wearing this perfume. Confident, elegant and aware of her presence.

I miss this perfume. Too bad it was discontinued, it was a masterpiece. Powdery in its supreme craft! There is no other powdery scent like this, there is some spicy hint in the midde. Not even Narciso Poudree beats its elegance.

I dont remember smelling anything like. The only scent that evokes the same feeling is bottega veneta edp, but it is a totally different scent.

Sillage : moderate
Lasting power : 8 hs
Iris, lots of powdery notes and musk and rice.
God i miss this scent! Chloe made a big mistake discontinuing it.",01/02/24 17:29,ballerinanoir
Love Chloé,"One of the most surprising, enlivening, spirited and inspiring perfumes ever.
A cold but soft freshness that lingers for a long time, days on clothes. Hyper feminine and luxurious.
It has something activating and comforting at the same time due to the somewhat resinous pink pepper, the musk and powdery notes.
All the flowers blended into this is just... perfect.

I like to wear it when i go out in the evening, in autumn, winter and perhaps early spring.

Still have half a bottle i now use sparingly since it's discontinued.
I have searched but i haven't found anything like this piece of art.",12/03/23 12:16,Parfluive
Love Chloé,"During the pandemic, my perfume obsession was reignited. I admittedly have always loved perfume but it wasn’t until I needed a hobby that distracted me from the ensuing chaos of an all too darkening reality that I dove in deeply. In those early days, I started trying to become educated on Covid because it was slowly becoming the centerpiece of my daily thoughts and interactions. Unsurprisingly, I was led to dismal corners of the internet predicting that whole ice skating rinks would need to become makeshift morgues in order to house the expected death tolls. There was unrelenting fear mongering and divisive arguing taking place on my social media pages. It was such a paranoia fueled, bleak time for everyone. I found myself supplementing Facebook and YouTube with this site more and more to evade the drama. Inadvertently, this is when I first discovered Love, Chloé through scouring message boards. It was one of my first fragrance acquisitions after neglecting my collection for a while.

Being fairly new to this world, I couldn’t appreciate the sophistication of LC. I sprayed it on my pulse points and it registered merely as a tangy, baby-powdery scent that overwhelmed me. It reminded me of a deodorant I had owned at some point and the settled way it smelled at the end of the day while I changed into my pajamas. This wasn’t necessarily a bad thing but it wasn’t quite what I expected. I had a friend try this on and she said it smelled like Liz Claiborne’s Curve to her 🤔 I had no idea how to interpret LC initially and it definitely is a unique scent that has grown on me in the last few years. It’s the first perfume I tend to think of for a special occasion and that right there shows its place in my heart. My initial thoughts of it being powdery were accurate. But it’s not solely powdery. It could be the pink pepper or the starch from the rice but there’s this grounding warmth to this scent that just expands throughout wear time. There’s just the slightest aspect of wood/dirt hidden behind the florals that makes the warmth radiate even more. It reminds me of that old Campbell’s chicken noodle soup commercial with the snowman. The soothing heat causes the snow to dissipate revealing a chipper, comforted child. I know it sounds strange but this exactly how this perfume makes me feel! That must be why I have a preference for wearing it in cold months which are pretty frequent in my state. I choose this indiscriminately to weather and more so when I want to feel uplifted but I find that it performs equally well in all seasons. You would be hard pressed to find a perfume that performs comparably to LC in the current market with regard to longevity. I can still smell this in the morning. The unique array of purple flowers is fascinating because it would seem that they would make this scent feel dated. It feels retro but not old-fashioned. Perhaps if you bottled Lana Del Rey’s essence of reinterpreting old-school glamour… all the old rules apply but it’s a new game. The orange flower enhances the soapier, clean aspect that this fragrance morphs into about an hour in. I am a sucker for a fragrance that has intricate layers woven into the duration. This is definitely one of those. It’s a whole ass symphony for the senses.

I can’t say enough good things EXCEPT how it’s been discontinued. What a shame that people can’t experience this scent anymore. If Chloé does actually decide to hear our woes and bring LC back, it would most likely be a hollow, replicated shell of its original exquisiteness. I have heard that Phyllis by Pull & Bear comes close to recreating LC. I don’t know if they discontinued that as well but it seems like it has fallen off the face of the earth. I have seen that the bottle design was altered but it looks like they just shelved it completely. Oil Perfumery has a decent dupe that I have tried. It’s the best dupe I have tried and does come close but it’s just an impression. I will disclose that I came close to selling my bottle at some point when I saw how much money the existing bottles were going for and really needed the extra cash. I did a little bit of whining while I took the pictures for the listing and edited them. I believe I even blurted out, “I don’t wanna!” In the end, I just couldn’t. I have never had such an attachment to a perfume I was listing like that before. My rationale on reselling perfume is usually that I might not be appreciating something in my collection that someone else might enjoy and get more use out of. The opposite happened with this fragrance. I kept thinking about what a void would be left if I parted with my bottle and how much less I would enjoy my collection if CL weren’t a part of it. Yes, I know it’s only perfume and yes, I have other perfumes (some would argue too many.) This particular perfume is special to me. I found it during such a hopeless time in my life where nothing felt glamorous, affirming, or comforting. This was my little reminder that those things were still tangible and I guess it still represents those things for me. My perfume passion has started to dwindle recently, as I think it has for a lot of us, but I will forever be inspired by scents like CL. The way they make you feel is indescribable but once they have imprinted on you, you can’t let go.",12/01/23 19:32,DieT CroaK

Love Chloé,"I initially was’t interested in sampling this are all as I’m not a huge fan of purple florals or powder scents, but in the name of science I tried it anyway. I initially sprayed it on a paper strip and wasn’t really enthralled, but later that night and for the rest of the week the small paper strip engulfed my handbag with a powder-soft cloud of irresistible goodness. I knew I had to immediately buy it that week and get a backup of this rare gem. Love, Chloe encapsulates the feeling of taking a warm clean cotton robe out of the dryer after a shower. It’s warm and comforting, blanketing your body in a deliciously addictive clean powdery scent that last on the skin for ages. I can’t recommend this enough and I wish Chloe would bring it back, I’ll want this in my collection forever. A true staple <3",09/01/23 11:46,KourtMcK

Love Chloé,"Love Chloe has been my daily choice for a long time. It offers the best expression of purple flowers and powder.

A pleasant mix of sweet vanilla powder, iris and spicy pepper at the beginning, followed by a light lilac. Unlike other sweet-powdery fragrances, it exudes femininity and elegance, giving a feeling of luxury, like a pink bubble bath. After drying, there is a delicate hyacinth sensation that lasts all day long. Love Chloe is truly unique, no other perfume can compare.

Love Chloé,"I wasn't sure what I would think of this one when I first received it. It wasn't fully my note profile as powdery can feel a bit boring sometimes; dated even. This, however, is so clean, feminine, divine, the slightest hint of angelic sweetness. My Husband never really notices my perfumes, but today he could not get his nose away from me ! He claimed this is what they were referring to in Outkast's So Fresh n So Clean... I mean, I'll take it. It's clean with a hint of sweetness. It's a soft feminine soapiness like you stayed in a cottage and they left out a basket with all of these beautiful little soaps in it. Feminine! Lovely! Discontinued! Ahh! I heard Oil Perfumery makes a wonderful dupe, so we will see.


EDIT: Love that I said powdery could be dated as it's now one of my favorite scents. I look back on some of my old reviews and shudder at my past self lol. I'm still opening up to new scent profiles all of the time and that's the exciting part about trying perfumes.",10/06/22 12:07,peachpony

This is quite strong and only 1 spray is needed but it is very pretty. The rice adds a unique sweet starchiness to the dry down. This is a lot better than most of the iris perfumes on the market right now probably because of the lack of citruses and the iris isn't overdone. The adding of other fresh and sweet florals tames down the dry airiness of the iris. Very feminine, long lasting, it smells like something from another era, but it should be in ours. Beautiful, sad it is discontinued.",07/23/22 15:09,LSAUG

When you finally get your hands on a decant, there's a hesitation to try it (as you risk falling in love with something discontinued), but the FOMO of not knowing what it smells like usually wins. This, thankfully, is something that I expected to love but didn't. This is powdery and to my nose, purple and ozonic. I would say that a significantly better version of this is Pourpre D'Automne by Maison Violet- and this one isn't discontinued. Perhaps if I didn't know of Pourpre D'Automne, I'd like Chloe Love a little more.",06/10/22 20:42,silthrill
Love Chloé,"Impeccably beautiful, this is what dreamy purple smells like. Iris, hyacinth, and heliotrope served on a cosmetic powder base. Soft rice accords lend some dimension.
Sillage is arms length at best, this scent is made to lean in and intake. Lasts for ages, 8-10 hours+. Perfect all year round, I wear this outside in spring and summer, and indoors in autumn and winter. Coziness galore.

Love Chloé,"It looks like a fragrance as if spice has been added to spring flowers. Although there is no rose in it, it has a pink rose-like tone. The fragrance is generally herbal aromatic. Spice can be felt, albeit in small amounts.

The fragrance is creamy and powdery with a high amount of floral and a very mild amount of spicy. The spice is hardly felt. Pink rose and lilac are very felt. It exudes an aromatic scent.

Contrary to the rating above, the fragrance stays on the fabric until the end of the day and has a high projection and silage ratio.

Love Chloé,"I do not have the original of this perfume. I have a solid perfume produced with the essences of this perfume. I will make my review according to the perfume I have.
First of all, it smelled too green to me at first. There is no sweetness. I can say that I smell a mixture of herbs, leaves and musk. After about 1 hour, the green scent fades and only a light floral musk scent remains. It is very difficult to distinguish the notes. They have achieved a beautiful unity with each other. In general, I liked it very much, except for that green smell at the beginning. Musk is with you from the beginning to the end. I am sure musk lovers will love this one.",04/21/22 01:47,melissa97

Love Chloé,"As I have finished a 75 ml bottle I’ve had for 6 years approximately, I find this deserves a hommage. When my mother bought a 30 ml bottle around 10 years ago, I was a bit sceptic. I like powdery scents, but this one didn’t really do it for me. However, over the years I completely fell for it, as a gentle and long lasting love. The scent is dreamy; in terms of powderyness I would describe it as creamy and modern. The purple flowers blend perfectly into the musk and rice, and it has amazing silage. Staying power on clothes is until the next day. Pity they discontinued it… but as all ending love affairs, there rests nothing but to accept it and move on. :)",03/06/22 03:55,melia
Love Chloé,"This would be my signature if it wasn’t discontinued. As much as I love this, I’m not paying 150+ for an unopened bottle of this, so I’m saving my 50ml bottle for special occasions. The pull and bear dupe is close, but not the same.

This is just the most gorgeous, spicy, powdery bouquet of purple flowers ever. Elegant, long lasting and sweet. Instant mood lifter. Love it beyond words.

Not like I don’t understand this being discontinued, since I can’t imagine it being super popular. Oh well. I’m still holding hope Chloe brings it back, as unlikely as that is.",02/28/22 12:56,pulcinella

Love Chloé,"Warning: This is going to be long!

Love Chloe is a dreamy powdery floral…clean, warm, distinctive, and has a vintage/nostalgic vibe to it that I love so much. I adore lilacs! There aren’t a lot of fragrances that feature this note and execute a composition so graceful and versatile...a true modern classic. The powderiness is reminiscent of luxury face powder, and you also get that clean feeling like you just got done taking a hot shower. You know that warm, fresh feeling after, you’re wrapping yourself in the fluffiest towel...and the scent of the best quality lilac shower gel that you used, it is heavily perfuming the steamy air around you. There is also that sweet musky smell of clean skin that adds an element of sensuality (this must be the rice steam and musk combination, it comes through more in the drydown and I adore that).

I smell a vast green garden with blooming purple flowers, a romantic vision, and yet, I see a woman dressed in softly monochromatic neutrals (like the ad) in a more urban setting, beige cashmere sweater, below the knee pleated skirt...she has doe eyes and perfectly parted soft hair, a cool and distant sort of beauty, and she is sitting in a quaint cafe in Paris, warming her hands around a hot drink. Her clean and well-assembled appearance attracts attention as she looks somewhat out of place. She gazes dreamily outside the window into the rainy streets outside. Her beauty may be reserved and distant, yet her eyes reflect warmth, tenderness and perhaps a restrained sensuality...perhaps a longing for something, or someone, or a time gone by. Nobody knows if she is waiting for someone, or what she is thinking, or what she is feeling, but most likely she is just content with the moment, with her self, indulging in her reveries.

This has been my signature scent since 2014. I was 27 when I first smelled this, and I immediately knew: ‘This is me’. Full stop. It was an instant love that never diminished. People close to me have even commented that this fragrance suits me so well. Before Love Chloe, my signatures were Miss Dior Cherie (2005 version), and then Lolita Lempicka (another evocative, powdery scent with a dreamy element to it...just sweet instead of classic like Love) after MDC got reformulated. I still wear LL to this day, but I had wanted something more serious, more polished and sophisticated than LL, more ‘clean’ than sweet, something that better reflected my maturing into my late 20s and beyond...however, I still required that innocent, ‘wet-eyed’, dreamy quality to my scent, that element of ‘fantasy’ that I never outgrew. Last but not least, I also wanted my signature to be distinctive and different from trending scents, something I can wear all year round, and with great projection and sillage to boot. And this scent fit the bill perfectly, it checked every single requirement and passed with flying colors (and that has never happened before!).

I bought back up bottles when it was getting hard to find, and by now I am running out. I am looking for a replacement to be my new signature and it is so difficult! We should petition for Chloe for bring back this gem!",11/06/21 22:07,marialena888m
Love Chloé,"To Kittymoon:

I have to disagree. Strongly disagree !!!
I had read reviews before buying this perfume, and the first one I have snatched was ""that tester"", which has had the word ""TESTER"" printed right on the bottle.
Now I have managed to grab some originals - and let me tell you:

THEY.ARE.THE.SAME ‼️‼️‼️

So to all little scared perfume lovers - do not be afraid to buy the tester, which is marked like that on its glass.
You will get your beloved Love, Chloe.

My personal opinion -
I do not like it, though I love a rice note in general. Not here. I am not going to wear Love, Chloe.
But I cannot say it is not done very well. VERY well. Like some others say - I am quite surprised that Chloe had managed to produce such good, memorable perfumes thus far, including original Chloe, EDP and Nomade (and all the flankers). There is no perfume like Love, Chloe, far and wide. The vintage powder and the rice note are very noticable, and play very well together. This is an elegant, inoffensive, lady-like perfume. Something similar I found in Narcisso Rodriguez Poudree, and the drydown of Chanel L'eau No.5. If you have ever had the chance to smell old, vintage makeup, there is this pleasant smell, especially in vintage powders. I find it pretty.",11/05/21 00:35,sisina96rv
Love Chloé,Super powdery. Like real old fashioned face powder. Some flowery notes. Some sweetness. Super strong when it comes to last power and projection. I just can’t imagine wearing it. It’s simply all powder. Over the top powder.,10/24/21 11:07,ShowMustGoOn
Love Chloé,"I got few years ago a 30ml bottle of Love, Chloé. Then I didn't pay any attention to it and it just sat in the back of my perfume closet. After trying it couple of times on my skin I decided to wear it. I do agree it's a feminine and sophisticated vintage powder puff scent but it's maybe too powdery in my eyes.
I am thinking of decluttering some of my perfumes that I just don't wear and Love, Chloé is one of them. So message me if you are interested to buy the 30ml bottle.

Love Chloé,"Found an unused perfectly kept miniature bottle in my aunts perfume fridge, and years after my first whiff (in which I hated the perfume but I was 18 back then) I smelled and tried Love once more, and I think I actually love this perfume... A sophisticated, soft and beautiful formulation! Smells almost dreamy, but for someone who still has a foot on the ground; she knows the melody of la vie en rose coming down the street doesn't speak of life but still daydreams on the reflection of her mirror, she eventually comes down the stairs for dinner back to her usual place in life. Reminds me of powder compacts my mother used to have when I was a child. I think the formulation works really strange on my skin; the first spray was powder and lilac but at the drydown I cannot tell the notes apart at all. It is immensely melancholic but also enchanting in its quiet way, might be one of my favorite makeup scented perfume.",08/21/21 04:27,god-infected

Abstract purple fowers, rice and clean musk give its distinct character. Gentle and elegant but noticable. It was my most complemented perfume. Now I rarely use the last 20 mls. of my current bottle. I will wait to open my back-up until Love will be relaunched.

It was my dream fragrance. There had been no perfume that made me feel the joy happiness that Love has brought. Only Chanel Beige evoked the same feelings. Despite they have no notes in common, it has a similar, happy, feel good and safe vibe. They both share that warm and clean, charming aura.

Love Chloé,"I finally, finally got the chance to smell this and I totally fell in love... Honestly, I didn't expect the Chloé perfume to be this good, as normally I used to get samples of their perfumes in shopping centers and I found them only ""nice, decent smelling"" and that's it... but this is very, very different.
Now I completely understand why Love is so loved by many here on Fragrantica. It's slightly sweet, powdery and had this unique (not too overbearing or floral-pungent) hint of soapiness, too, which gives the fragrance this beautiful soft and clean, heavenly smell of innocence (it's almost baby-like). The scent also feels kind of nostalgic, in a way, but it makes me smile every time I smell it.
I absolutely love powdery perfumes and this is ""the new kind of powdery"" I don't have in my collection yet.
It's such a shame that this beauty got discontinued. They should really bring it back. :(",06/30/21 05:09,Skinterpreter

Love Chloé,"Why on earth was this discontinued? It is such a pretty, airy, feminine fragrance. It's perfect for the office because it is innocuous; yet it's noticeable due to its nice sillage. It evokes compliments and has good longevity (typically about 6 to 8 hours). Even after a shower, I can sometimes still smell it lightly on my skin. As for the scent itself, it's a nice combination of green, powdery, sweet, and slightly woody notes. It is well blended and doesn't smell overwhelmingly of one particular note, although the purple floral notes have a slight prominence. In the dry down, it remains true to its composition and doesn't turn too powdery. This is a perfect daytime scent and I hope it will be relaunched soon.",06/18/21 18:30,tinadee
Love Chloé,I’m not surprised this is discontinued...I don’t know why I keep trying Chloe perfumes since I never liked one.,06/14/21 07:18,Ellsa
Love Chloé,"This is powdery perfection. It smells like baby powder and makeup in the best way possible and it's a shame it's discontinued. I managed to find a 20 ml brand new bottle on ebay that wasn't too expensive, but I use it sparingly.

I find that Pull & Bear Phyllis is an incredible dupe. It's a tad fresher and doesn't have the faint pencil shavings smell of the original. Another vaguely similar perfume is Montale Powder Flowers, but this one smells like straight-up baby powder before it turns into a slightly more flowery scent after a few hours. A third option, and the most far-fetched, is Byredo Slow Dance. In the dry-down it's reminiscent of Love, Chloe. While it's not as sweet, more boozy, mature and definitely unisex, there is a lovely powderiness from the vanilla and violet notes.",06/07/21 10:13,s3raph1nas

Love Chloé,"THIS is the Purple Flower Powder Puff fragrance I've been looking for. A generous Fragrantican sold me her used bottle at a wonderful price and as soon as I opened the package I could tell it was something special.
It's a gentle perfume but the sillage is excellent, managing to be strong enough to remain present even at a distance without ever becoming cloying or overbearing. This is both sweet and slightly savory, with an elegant and feminine blend of florals that reads like a natural bouquet. You know how a room smells when you have fresh blossoms somewhere in a vase? Alive and clean and pretty.
The powder aspects here are not dry, but creamily blend with my skin, courtesy of the musk in the base. The rice is not cosmetic to me, but edible and wholesome and warm. I can't say I've smelled anything like it but it does bring up memories of a time in my life when I used Nivea hand cream religiously. It was the one in the white packaging, and I remember the sum total of my personal smell being a combination of juicy leave in conditioner, honeysuckle perfume, and hand lotion. Something about Love, Chloe recalls that seamless blending of various beauty products into one very unique signature scent.
I don't understand who in their right mind discontinued this but I have a bone to pick with them.",05/13/21 13:29,NicoleET88

Love Chloé,"I should love this by just looking at the purple notes alone, but I don't. The orange blossom combined with the musk goes very barnyard on me, smelling like a cow patty. Orange blossom is a hard one for my skin, combine that with musk and it never works. Insolence by Guerlain is one EdT I can take with it (no musk in that one), but the EdP version of it is too much, even with just the orange blossom. I wouldn't classify this scent as a safe blind buy like I would Chloe, the original. I only have a mini bottle that came in a dual with Chloe, and it's so cute I'll never give it away.",04/16/21 15:15,ceeceelee

Now i searched the web to see if i can buy another bottle considering it is really and truly discontinued and not just something i thought... omg am I now obsessed with finding a bottle since it is discontinued... and feeling absolutely gutted that this scent i have come to associate with happiness, I won't again, once this bottle is finished.

Love Chloé,"Perfection in a bottle! Elegant, sophisticated, very well done perfume. Nothing to envy a niche brand whatsoever.
This is not your every day generic type of fragrance. It is hard to describe but delicious to smell. It's definitely a powdery smelling perfume, albeit well-done. No baby-powder smell here (nothing against baby-powder scents, this is just not the case). To my nose, this is a very complex scent where pinpointing a note or two is hard (except for the powder and the pink pepper). It's neither sweet nor tart, definitely not your typical spring floral scent either, which makes it an unsafe blind buy. There is, though, a soapy quality about it that is absolutely divine.

Let us behold the exquisite minimalistic bottle for a while.

Suited for night time and/or cold days. The longevity both in skin and clothes is a monster and sillage is just perfect...not too Jean-Paul Gaultier ""Hey look at me"" (which I particularly dislike).

No over spraying is required! In fact, by all means avoid it, unless you want to end up sneezing due to the pepper note. Unfortunately It has been discontinued. I only have one bottle that's holding on for dear life.

This is my beloved signature scent.

10/10 hands down.",11/25/20 13:45,Mel14

Love Chloé,"@ioanaszmeu, your bottle may have a problem. I used Love for four years but it was never nose burning, too dry and non-sweet. It's strong at first but then settles and turnes into a relaxing fragrance. It has a kind of make-up powder sweetness. It doesn't smell like any cleaning product but has a similarity with scented tissues. It may be cloying when sprayed generously or used without giving a break. At least, according to my experiences. Regards...",10/14/20 16:14,ArtDecoStyle
Love Chloé,"One of the powderiest fragrances.

Chloe Love is a powdery smell from start to finish; clean, cool, musky powder. This powdery scent turned feminine with a sprinkle of purple floral notes on top, mainly the iris and lilac. It does smell makeup-y. It is in the same vein as Narcios's Pure Musc; both very clean and musky scents.

A lovely, inoffensive fragrance better suited for the cooler days.

Weirdly reminds me of my mom when I would hug her as a child and would get a comforting whiff of her powder blush. It’s floral, slightly sweet but not in a sickening way, powdery but not in a sickening way as well. Just smells motherly, I don’t know if that makes sense. The name is fitting, it smells like unconditional motherly love. Like compact makeup, mature and sweet. So sad this is discontinued.

Extremely powdery but something about it was so extravagant and unique, just unforgettable. I last owned this about 8 years ago, but I remember exactly how it smelled. I have no idea why it got discontinued, it really stood out from the rest of the Chloe fragrances.",09/20/20 11:15,kkaattjjeess
Love Chloé,The most subtle and elegant perfume I have ever come across. It reminds me of a very expensive Chanel powder compact. Like liquid gold but never Vulgar. It’s like ivory silk pyjamas that fit your every curve perfectly. The violets come through in the dry down but definitely not overly sweet or sickly. I always get compliments from men on this fragrance. I wouldn’t say it’s for summer but I sprits a little on my clothes instead of skin on warmer days. A lot softer than original Chloe but got its own Je Ne Sais Pa... Have been wearing this since 2010. Chloe need to bring this back it’s getting harder to come by! Pure class.,09/15/20 05:14,SmellsJustLike
Love Chloé,"This smells vintage. I don't think it's particularly crowd pleasing. Reminds me of an expensive soap/powder. It's very sweet but airy. I would only wear it indoors to feel cozy. I used to own and love this years ago, and was on the hunt for a ""left over"" bottle. Only thing is,I don't trust I will get the real deal... So I decided to give Pull and Bear's ""Phyllis"" a whirl, and boy that's a great dupe! The opening is more citrussy than I remember, but the dry down is spot on.

Whatever accords they have mixed here, on ME, that is point blank all it is. I do like Wisteria, a LOT, but I do not get that here. I sprayed half a spray, no need for anymore. Selling it on Ebay for what I paid. Fail.",08/09/20 13:02,Nataliemarie
Love Chloé,"Sadly, it wasn't as wonderful as I was expecting.
I was expecting a gorgeous, lush, heavenly, super-feminine, glamorous, powdery scent.

In reality, I feel it is more of a drug-store powdery body spray. It's sharp and spicy in its opening and only mildly settles throughout its life. There's definitely lilac and iris. The lilac isn't the gentle, sweet scent I usually love in lilacs. The iris does provide a slight cosmetic scent, but not an intoxicating one.
The powder notes are - of course - present. Again, it smells too light, airy...and, well...lower-quality. Hence, the drug store body spray.
Standard longevity and not a great deal of sillage. A skin scent. The scent is nice enough. Just noticeably average. Gorgeous bottle, though.

I feel like this is the scent that would come out of a body spray I would have bought for my mother as a Mothers' Day present at about 7 years old, with no money, and no clue what she actually liked!
Be careful when buying this for the exorbitant prices its going for online. Personally, I found it didn't live up to the hype. :(

Love Chloé,"This is perfection. And I'll hardly ever call that a fragrance, no matter how much I personally enjoy it.
But this one is simply perfect alright. Heady, yet airy. Beautiful, with nothing pathetic about it. Floating but stubborn. Clean and soapy, not sterile though. Hyper feminine floral. Sweet just enough! It's on the verge to end up bland, instead there's something just a tiny bit bitter added, in order to keep it tasteful altogether.
It's so pretty, so posh, you cannot miss her in a crowd nor mistake her for a commoner. She is the princess in her community - strikingly beautiful with perfect facial symmetry, preppy, with perfect manners and the best education out there. And hopelessly romantic.
She has never experienced cruelty whatsoever.",07/28/20 16:25,Nomen

Love Chloé,"Ill be giving a review as best I could in describing this fragrance. This fragrance starts with spiceness as we could see theres pink pepper in the top notes. It is kinda annoying since the more I spray the fragrance, the more spicy it becomes. And then slowly I could smell myself like belvita biscuit (its either the musk or the rice) since at this moment the musk is getting intensifies. Then I could barely smell the mix of this belvita biscuit scent and a note (I have no clue what the note is) which smells so greeny like a vegetable, really reminds me of a vegetable but still no idea. Then yes we r coming to the base which smelllssss so lovely, the powder and the musk + the belvita biscuit. This fragrance is spicy, sweet, musky, powdery. But the sillage is so soft and the longevity is average. This fragrance reminds me of something but i forget it so its not unique but still lovely",07/01/20 21:32,Thoriq Dorz
Love Chloé,"I consider powdery scents to be my favorite type of fragrances. Love, Chloe is beyond just being powdery, it's luxurious. It smells like expensive cosmetics. Super feminine and soothing.

Love Chloé,"I really need a full bottle of this, but the price is way up there! I haven't decided to take the plunge. I think it's beautiful. Soft and sexy, the powder, iris, and heliotrope are gorgeous on top of the musky notes. I was so surprised because I haven't found any other Chloe's to be anywhere near as good. Now to find a bottle, even partially used, that won't break the bank!
EDIT - it's fate. Just found a 1.7 oz for a more down to earth cost.
EDIT 5/25/20 - the more I wear this, the deeper I fall in love with it. If I did the signature scent thing, this would certainly be a contender, though the list is long. It makes me feel very sexy, something that is hard to find in powdery scents, which veer more to the romantic in my opinion. I can't get enough of it, but will have to be judicious in my application because of it's high price and increasing scarcity. True love for Love!",05/19/20 18:21,churinl

Gorgeous stuff, ultimately not really for me. There is something just a little too perfect in this perfume. I don't wear silk blouses, perfectly tailored pants or classic long-line jackets.

It is a light but not fresh perfume rather suitable for the day than the night. Composed mainly of purple colored flowers, it's a soft floral which has a base of rise, musk and powdery notes, so if it wasn't for the pink pepper and orange at the top of the composition then the juice of Love, Chloe would smell more simple. It's a nice blended contemporary composition of lilac and rise powder. Also, I love love love the metal details and the heavy glass and the light peach color in the bottle!

This fragrance contains one of the loveliest mixtures of musks I’ve ever smelled; it’s sensual yet comforting. It has so many layers and changes slightly on everyone’s skin I feel like I don’t have the words to do it full justice. But this has been one of my favourites since I was that 17 year old girl, and I know it will be, for many, many more years. A modern classic and gem.",06/27/19 07:10,roseberries_
Love Chloé,"Heavenly. Powdery, creamy in the dry down (I swear there's something vanilla-y in there somewhere), clean in that just-bathed-with-beautiful-soap way. So sensual. Ultra feminine. The holy grail of perfumes (for me!).",06/13/19 16:45,florally
Love Chloé,"This one is clean, warm and powdery. It's like I've just emerged from the most luxurious outdoor bath, in a garden of blooming purple flowers. Sunshine, steam, warm skin, fine bath products, lilacs, greens. A barely-there touch of sweetness. Yes, the 'expensive face powder' note is quite dominant for the first hour or so, but on my skin, it doesn't hijack the composition, the scent gets better with time. Very classy, very 'French', and very feminine, but also down to earth, inviting and versatile. A fine, modern scent with a nostalgic twist, très retro-chic! If it were a person it would be a fresh-faced natural beauty who exudes effortless elegance and a warm sincerity (imagine the wholesome charms of a young Brigete Bardot). Suits many different occassions, any age group (I've been wearing it since my mid-20s), and works all year round. Sillage and longevity are excellent, and it smells different from what most girls/women are wearing these days. You will stand out wearing Love Chloe. I will never understand its discontinuation. Luckily I have back up bottles. I get compliments from both genders when I wear this. Men seem to like it more though...the last guy who smelled it on me was a 24 year old aquaintence, he commented that I always smell so clean and sensuous, and he wasn't sure if it was my perfume or if I'd just taken a shower. It feels very 'me', like 2nd skin, and it will remain as my signature for as long as I can get my hands on it.",06/09/19 20:50,Bambi.fq
Love Chloé,"Love Love :-) Love, Chloe. I don't know why they discontinued that fragrance. It was my favorite from the line. I found it very feminine - powdery and long lasting.",05/22/19 07:50,irismrd
Love Chloé,"Hi guys, i have noticed that this fragrance is discontinued. Just to help out to whoever loves this perfume they do have it on creedperfumesamples.com i think they ship from UK",04/02/19 12:29,saleperfum007
Love Chloé,"Par pitié ne cessez pas la production de ""Love"" !! Mon flacon arrive à la fin et je n'ai pas eu le temps d'acheter de nouveau ce parfum poudré qui me rend folle !!! J'adore ""Love Chloé""....",02/28/19 00:42,irisjetaime
Love Chloé,this one is so feminine and beautiful!!!,02/20/19 01:08,Indah Ayu
Love Chloé,"I’m not at all surprised that Chloe has discontinued Love. Fragrances reminiscent of old time face powder and lipstick aren’t the current fashion, even though there are hoards of us who find it delightful and nostalgic.

Having said that though, I can’t love Love.

For me, the powderiness is overdone to the extent that this fragrance can be smothering. How many powdery notes can be thrown into one bottle? Powder, iris, violet, heliotrope (yes, it can be powdery) and musk.

Love definitely needs a light hand.

I don’t hate Love, and it can be comforting after a shower and before bed, but if you can’t get hold of this now that it is discontinued, Guerlain’s Insolence EDP might be a nice alternative for you.",01/23/19 17:30,Lilacs&Lavender
Love Chloé,"I've got admit I'm addicted to this. I own a load of florals but Love Chloe is my fave. I do detect the powderiness of iris and face powder but it's the lilac and hyacinth that make this special for me. Heaven knows why this beauty has been discontinued!
It has a little vanilla sweetness from the heliotrope and enough musk to soften and merge the notes.
My birthday is in May just when the lilac is in bloom in the south of the UK. This scent really transports me to this time when spring is nearly done and everything is still new and fresh.
It doesn't screech at you as some floral do. This is soft but also not weak. It is entrancing. My search for a lilac scent is done. It works beautifully in this.
I admit I'm on the wrong side of 40 but this is what I reach for when I particularly want to feel confident and feminine.
I'm so pleased that I also get moderate sillage and longevity. Please bring it back!!!",01/15/19 15:21,shushkin
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,You can definitely tell this is a Chloe flanker upon first whiff. Within seconds sparkles of tangerine and black current twinkle around the rose. It's backup bottle worthy.,08/09/25 17:04,BlackLabLuca
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Whoa I have a colleague that wears it almost everyday and is zesty tangerine floral smell. Very elegant, and quite strong for an EDT. I added it immediately to my wishlist.",06/18/25 00:25,IMadeleine
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,I love this. It’s so delicate and pretty!! I couldn’t stop smelling it when I sprayed it. It smells like drinking mimosas at a picnic in back of a chateau. Loveeee!,05/31/25 15:34,chrissy98
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Pretty, sparkly but very similar to the Chloé I own.
I do pick up a bit of Tangerine 🍊",05/22/25 13:40,Bea84
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"This is basically Chloé with a fleeting whisper of tangerine. But so fleeting, that if you blink, you’ll miss it. The citrus pops up in the very beginning, stays for under a minute, and then it’s gone, leaving behind the familiar powdery rose DNA of the original.

Citrus top notes are naturally volatile, so it’s no surprise they disappear quickly. But if this was meant to be a citrusy twist on Chloé, the tangerine needed more weight, something bolder to carry the opening before fading out. As it stands, it feels almost identical to the original, to the point where I’m not entirely sure this needed to exist as a separate release.

A workaround? Maybe layering it with a bit of mandarin essential oil before spraying. The oil will capture the fragrance and deliver a better longevity, and you'd get the citrus it promises.

Pretty, wearable, pleasant, but not a citrus-forward experience. This is Chloé, lightly touched, not transformed.",04/29/25 20:49,MetaMystic
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I loved it the first time I smelled it. On me it smells like a chamomile tea, so fresh and natural and makes me relaxed and happy. It's the only scent that works for me among all Chloe perfumes. I'm glad that I picked it up by accident. After 2 hours, it starts to smell like the original Chloe, but more woody and less sweet. It lasts relatively long and becomes a skin scent after 2 hours. And it's perfect for me because I can't stand strong perfumes. I have tried it multiple times and really liked it, will get a big bottle when I get a good price.",04/24/25 11:13,another.pistachio
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"What a lovely fresh scent. On paper I love this, its just so fresh, I just kept smelling the paper, and had to get a bottle.
Next to Roses De Chloé I definitely smell the difference, as this is less rose and more tangerine and citrus fresh, but they are certainly sisters in the DNA.
On my body chemistry this hits different though, the tangerine in the opening is not so fresh, but it smells sweet like honey. I am not into sweet perfumes, so this opening is not so much for me, but after 30 minutes or so I really do enjoy it, and it sort of becomes similar to the Roses de Chloé on me. Lesson learned, test the perfume on the skin.",03/17/25 05:47,locg
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I LOVE the tangerine 🍊 blast of zesty freshness I get from this (which I blind bought by the way) knowing I’d love it. It’s backed up by the rose and blackcurrant giving it some body and character in the background. It is very well blended, that I feel that the main co-star of this perfume, the tangerine, is what I actually get as the main scent. The tangerine is what I wanted and is what I get. And is contrasted with the Chloe clean/ soapy/ rose sparkly essence. This note makes me feel joy. It doesn’t last but I have an aveda tangerine essential oil i will use with it when I’m feeling more organised. I think that will help. I’ve always loved this style of Chloe bottle although I’ve never owned the classics only the nomade naturelle which I loved initially and is still special but is especially sweet and I am not really a sweet fragrance wearer but I do still love to smell it from the bottle. This however is fresh and classy combined in perfect unison. If you enjoy citrus fragrances that are perfumey but not heavy you should enjoy this, even if longevity is somewhat lacking. I’ve already bought a back up. That’s how confident I am that I’ll get through this. Enjoy 🍊",01/01/25 13:40,Rainstorm
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I quite like it, although it wasn’t what I expected. It opens up very green and fresh, then settles into a powdery rose enveloped in a warm, realistic tangerine. I expected it to be zesty and sharp, but instead it’s green-to-powdery and slightly sweet. The sillage isn’t crazy, this is more of a skin scent, but lasting power is good, sometimes I can still smell it on my wrist the next day.",12/27/24 20:04,addangel
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Very weather dependent for me, for some reason. I strongly associate it with spring and usually with summer, meaning I usually like it when it’s 15+°C outside. Wind and open air also suit this perfume. It’s very long lasting and with strong sillage. Has some sparkling soapy quality to it, like most Chloé rose perfumes. I’m not a big fan of solo rose in perfumes, but I like this one: it’s not dry, sour, heavy or migraine-inducing, but rather fresh and citrusy in a moderately soapy way.",12/04/24 10:49,santaliza_16
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"What is up with this? It was a nice scent of the original classic Chloe (from the early 2000's, not the one from the 70's) mixed with a strong note of tangerine, but it vanished from my skin within minutes 🤯! I mean there is no trace of it, not even some lingering aromachemicals. I am just baffled as to how they can even charge money for this and baffled as to how it's possible to disappear like that 🫥",10/26/24 20:10,AveParfum
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Tengo solo una muestra pequeña, pero me sorprendió tantísimo cuando lo aplique y lo primero que vino a mi mente fue agarrar un ramo de flores y rosas y pegar mi nariz en el para luego inhalar profundamente. Se siente tan natural, tan orgánico. Como si realmente hubiesen rosas encapsuladas dentro de esta botella.
Es suave, es girly, es fresco, es rosa, grita feminidad y suavidad a todo pulmón.",09/25/24 10:35,Nanvely
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"For me, by far the best Chloe scent in this particular bottle shape. Fresh, zesty, clean, with a hint of greenery. Love to wear this as a light inoffensive everyday perfume for the office. Also the perfect kind of clean girl scent. Perfect for wearing post workout after you’ve showered and are leaving the gym. Feels like the right type of thing for that. I like layering an citrus heavy body spray if I’m looking to bump up the subtle tangerine note.",08/25/24 20:10,CarlyD1234
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,The rose and tangerine notes complement each other very well. It’s smells like a garden in summer - I was expecting to see a green accord as I feel it’s quite a green fragrance. I wish the longevity and oomph was there because it’s such a beautiful scent.,06/22/24 18:11,pocketfullofposies
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"WAY better than the original Chloe! The original Chloe is beautiful, but more powdery than it is floral. Chloe Rose Tangerine made me feel so pretty and happy…it’s so fresh, youthful, and rosy. Springtime in a bottle.",06/21/24 13:33,woodlandwitch

Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Call me crazy, but this perfume gives me the “vibe” of one of my favorites perfumes ever, and sadly discontinued. Florabotanica balenciaga and rose tangerine gives me the same vibe, fresh, green, aromatic. Not a dupe, but in the sane category.
Actually im wearing florabotanica in one wrist, and rose tangerine in the other, and It feels like I find the baby sister of my beloved one.
Fresh, simple, any occasion perfume.

Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,The perfect white tee running errands type of scent ! I really like this one !,11/02/23 22:27,karinevandal
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Delicate and light. Soft citrus in the opening. Both the tangerine and rose smell realistic. The black currant brings the scent a gentle green spiciness, like the scent of the black currant plant's leaf.

A safe, pleasant scent that could be worn any time any place.",10/29/23 04:43,AinoKaroliina
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"This is the first perfume that I have ever found that reminds me of the wonderful discontinued Victoria’s Secret Victoria Eau de Perfume Cologne from 1991 which was my signature perfume for over a decade, Even though this perfume smells heavily of rose, there is something in the dark honey-ish undertone that it settles on my skin that is EXACTLY like Victoria. For me, that makes this a winner. I wish the longevity was a bit longer like Victoria though. The silage and longevity are less, which makes this ideal for the workplace.

Some people comment they can’t smell the tangerine; I only smell distinct tangerine for about 2 minutes and then it settles into citrus that is balanced nicely by the other elements. I think this is a VERY well balanced perfume with rose settling at the top, but not in a sickeningly sweet way. The middle and bottom notes anchor the rose in such a way that is attractive and sensible, with a hint of sexy.

As long as you like rose, this should be a safe blind buy.",10/21/23 21:52,joygrassman
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"This is classic Chloe DNA : sharp, fresh and a good mix of floral and fruits. I'm not a fan of tangerines in perfume but I do like this one, it settles in very nicely. After 2 hours, you get this nice light woody/ambery scent. But it is quite light, so the tenacity isn't the best. At first there's a good sillage, but it weakens pretty fast. Great for office, school or day-wear in general. I wouldn't buy a bottle because this isn't my kind of perfume exactly. As someone who doesn't like citrusy perfumes that much, it is pretty great!",10/15/23 08:00,Claugregg
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Sweet, fresh, fruity rose, inoffensive and office appropriate makes you feel clean and fresh. Longevity and sillage are moderate, might need to be topped up throughout the day. Not a special or memorable fragrance but likeable.",08/17/23 17:38,Binst145
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Initially smells like PURELL on me and turns green and bitter after an hour, with a little bit of rose peeking through. I smell like a grandma’s bathroom, in a bad way. It’s a pass for me.",06/30/23 18:24,Van_D
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"It smells like roses de Chloe with citrus, just that simple lol. I still prefer original Chloe over this though, I’ve gotten more compliments with Chloe Eau De Parfum. Go figure. Longevity is super low, like 2 hours max on a good day, so you’ll need to reapply.",06/28/23 11:34,Ohtaycanyousee
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"There are things in this rose that are lovely, however it becomes rather too green and bitter with a Lovage accord that seems to be of popular use in many fragrances these days... I'm not a fan. I'm sure on the right skin it could be lovely. Not for me.",06/11/23 17:34,jesz
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,A photorealistic dewy rose. Quite nice and delicate. It’s an EDT so it becomes close to skin an hour after spraying.,05/10/23 15:44,justcheckinout
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"The sparkling, ticklish and zesty version of the original, which is already a masterpiece to me. It performs a little less well, and as you would expect from an EDT, but stays on the skin on the same way as the OG. Is it a necessary addition if you already have the original? I don't think so, but this one is perfect if you want a slightly punchier version. Or a big Chloé fan <3 In any case: lovely :)",05/05/23 05:37,Icarel
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Fresh rose, with tangerine which brings a subtle natural sweetness, and a woody background. A bit soapy. Pretty, young, ultra-feminine. Terrible longevity (2 hours). When you first spray it, the sillage is great but it becomes soft quickly. I like the scent, but the performance is a let down. Then again it's a fresh EDT so it is what it is.",04/08/23 20:46,Clairexoxo
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Tested at Sephora. I used to really want a bottle of this. Smelling it again, it’s just alright. Clean fresh rose, with a drip of tangerine. Doesn’t have enough character for me I guess.",03/23/23 15:24,girldeadbug
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"For an EDT, this is unusually strong right out of the gate. Using very little, the scent is all around me. It does fade out as you would expect for an EDT and within a couple of hours, it's much softer. I find it more floral than fruity, fresh, elegant and feminine. A perfect, pretty scent for everyday wear in the warmer spring and summer months with that lovely rose you know from Chloe fragrances.",02/06/23 10:36,mevans
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"While not a perfect rose scent by any means, Rose Tangerine is a great improvement on Roses de Chloe in terms of longevity and throw. It still sits fairly close to the skin, but the rose note stays around for much longer. It is slightly sweeter and obviously has a great zing from the citrus, but it is still a rose-focused perfume. The two smell similar enough to me that one would not need both, and if I had to choose between the two Rose Tangerine would win hands down to come home to my collection. Of course the bottle is lovely and would look gorgeous on any vanity or dressing table, but the scent is pretty and also approachable enough that those looking to dip their toe in rose scents might really enjoy this one.",01/30/23 12:22,silverlocusts
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Oh noooo... I had so many expectations based on the notes and reviews...
It smells like celery on me, I have no idea how this is even possible! That said, I can't give an impartial review, I guess this just doesn't work on my skin. I'm mostly writing this for my future reference and to warn anybody who intends on blind buying it. Don't. Try it on first.",01/25/23 06:03,Frantheone
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I already had Chloé by Chloé but was getting bored of it from time to time and I love citrusy scents which is why rose tangerine seemed like a great option for me. While I absolutely adore the scent and I get the rose and the tangerine and the black currant, the longevity is just non existent, it kind of makes me mad. I get it, it’s edt not edp but it just does not excuse it’s longevity.",01/11/23 03:19,darlindearest
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I really love this. I really smell the rose in it. At least on my skin. I've noticed that I tend to like perfumes that are flowers with some citrus. This is it. If you're not a floral person, this isn't for you. I love it though. Very pretty. I spray it in my hair.",01/08/23 14:50,fifimsp
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"This is a lovely and elegant rose scent like from years back, although I can smell something green in there. The blackcurrant is somewhat faint and I can barely smell the tangerine, but overall this is a scent I enjoy sniffing. It lasts for about four hours before it turns into a skin scent, but when I sprayed it on the shawl I was wearing I could still smell it the next day.",01/03/23 07:07,Soledad89
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"My first Chloe and I knew I would love it (it was a blind buy). It is so elegant, delicate, and uplifting. Roses and tangerines are here, but none of them are suffocating or harsh. It's so well-balanced! Sits close to the skin, but is long-lasting (especially on clothes). I can't stop sniffing at it! Très chic!🧡🌹🍊",10/19/22 03:04,Twentzel
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Gorgeous! Sparkling, joyful, enjoyable, and vibrant. On me, this is a very clean, sweet orange with a delicate pink rosebud undertone. Although it smells like fresh dewy pink roses, its longevity leaves much to be desired at the end of the day. Tangerine, for whatever reason, seems to stick to the skin better. It's extremely stunning and a must-have!",10/04/22 02:07,abbieclark67
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I like this scent very much.
Maybe it's not the best, the most suprising or the most exqusite fragrance. But definetley it's one of the most comforting. At least for me.
On my skin Rose Tangerine turn into rosy-peachy combo with hint of musk. You can almost feel this peachy, fluffy skin of fruit. Decent longevity (6h approx.), good for work, not to loud - will not cause any unplesant sensation/migrene, not offend anyone. I could wallow in this peachy cloud forever ... but my husband can't stand it :(. All he can get from Rose Tangerine it's ""stinky rose"".
What a pity!",10/02/22 23:31,ankaa
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"As someone already mentioned, it smells like a rose shampoo: very refreshing rose with black currant and a little spice. The tangerine is undetectable on me.
Three-to-four sprays are enough to last a few hours, and you can definitely smell it on yourself.
On me, the scent barely changes; it dries down practically the same, just a little warmer and spicier.
An overall lovely fragrance, one I could see many liking, but I would not repurchase it, as I prefer some sweetness.",09/08/22 21:08,Leenchen
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,Zero sweetness. Has bite. Refreshing bug spray.,08/28/22 19:46,PGak
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Very pretty for those who want a rose fragrance where the rose takes a back seat. On me this is mostly tangerine, but it's a great tangerine. Juicy, pulpy, with a hint of bitterness you may find in the rind. A great find for citrus lovers who prefer a garden-fresh citrus over a candied citrus.",08/28/22 14:25,rainydays
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"This one is really good. it definitely has the Chloe DNA, and for some, at first scent, they might not be able to get it.
that was my case.

I tried it again one of these nights, after shower. at first, there is a strong note of tangerine, citrusy and juicy.
then it comes the rose. but it is not a rose like roses de Chloe, I would describe as a petal being crushed and you get that fresh rose smell.

the dry down is pretty simple, tangerine citrusy and the petal scent mixed.

good longevity on my skin, poor sillage. but still, a must have for Chloe perfume lovers.

to the ones that love the Chloe edp, this has its DNA, but a lot less serious and a lot more luminous, I would not say fresh, but light.

there it is.",08/27/22 18:35,ballerina77
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"The first five minutes of this on my wrist smelled a lot like Roses de Chloe (which I like, but don’t want another perfume of the same scent) and then it turned into a brighter, sparkling, sweet rose that’s just so uplifting and refreshing. I’ll keep wearing this sample until I run out. Hope I have enough to form a good decision of whether or not it’s full bottle worthy.",08/15/22 01:51,froggytable
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"At first I hated it, especially the opening. I get the black currant more than the tangerine. I got sour wine. But now I am a fan of the whole fragrance. It’s a rose shampoo scent to me and I am all about the clean/soapy/shampoo scents.",08/11/22 00:46,VioletDr
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I agree with the previous comment. If you're willing to wait for the dry down it's gorgeous....the tangerine is a uplifting one, it has a herbal seaside note. Best from the Chloe range.",08/06/22 10:18,aldinatic
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"1 - 3 sprays, lightly misted: fresh roses and citrus zest with a slight fruity undertone. Fresh, clean, delicate and youthful.

If applied more heavily than that it gets too bitter, like a grapefruit zest overdose.

This is one of those fragrances that must be worn with a slight hand. It's beautiful when worn correctly. I bought a small bottle yesterday.",06/05/22 10:44,KBreckenridge
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I have received a sample of this fragrance, it smells very straightforward, there is nothing else but a velvet rose🌹. I have a cheap hairspray that smells exactly as this fragrance, so I think you should be a big fan of this brand and rose scent to purchase this fragrance",05/19/22 03:36,Gioia's secret
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Almost smells like rose-scented baby wipes in the bottle but once sprayed is a fresh rose but with more of a white floral note compared to say Red Roses by Jo Malone. It stays like that in the dry down to my nose. I don't smell any tangerine or blackcurrant or the base notes so I'm quite sad about that but found that Gia by Tocca is what I wanted this to be, a citrusy rose.

Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I am new to the house of Chloe. I have never smelled the original Chloe edp, so this is just a review for the Chloe Rose Tangerine edt.

I put the perfume on around 7:30 this morning. It was a soft rose with a hint of green sweetness that morphed into a more robust rose as it heated on my skin. It still remained lightly sweetened by the tangerine and soft wine note of the black currant.

By 11:50 on my skin it is very sweet but on my clothing the rose still dominates. Overall the affect is quite lovely. The rose is a bit powdery like the Miss Dior Rose N'Roses Roller Pearl (not to be confused with the edt...this one is the oil roller). I don't think I need both scents in my collection, but so far out of the two Chloe Rose Tangerine edt, is the better. However both are nice and long lasting on my dryer skin type.

It is 3:30 in the afternoon, and the sweetness on my skin is still there, and a soft fluffy rose like a halo remains.",04/04/22 09:53,LisaMCollins
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"The beginning of this perfume smells exactly like fresh Turkish red roses and I love rose smell. Dry down grows on my skin, it becomes more intense and outstanding. I don't know how but maybe this perfume triggered my smell memory. In conclusion I loved this perfume.",03/23/22 22:43,BilgeD
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I adore this scent but because of my warm body chemistry, the smell of tangerine struggles to make it past the heavy floral scent so it's definitely not ""fresh"" on me. The staying power is incredibly weak as well, even for an EDT. My 'Blooming Bouquet' by Dior lasts longer than this one. I am however addicted to this scent. The floral smells more like a fresh garden instead of potpourri which I love so I may try getting my hands on the 5ml travel size bottle. If I end up really loving it I may consider the 30ml in the future, but the longevity and projection is extremely poor on me. I do highly recommend testing it on your skin. If you have a cooler skin temperature, this might work for you :)",03/11/22 14:13,Effielove
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"My mouth is watering just thinking of this fragrance, no lie. I love the original EDP, and I got a sample of this one when purchasing something else, and to me, they smell basically the same, the only distinction being that the designers of Rose Tangerine managed to replicate the explosive juiciness of the individual pulps you feel when you bite down into a tangerine for this fragrance. Definitely a younger, fresher version of the original. Yum!",03/09/22 20:11,bazbazar
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Omg - this is gorgeous! I kept forgetting to try it when I was anywhere that sells it, so finally I just ordered it. I wish I bought the big bottle. Next time. Who knows why some notes hit some sweet spot in our brains and ignite euphoria! I wish I knew exactly what they were…but, luckily, my whatever activates my dopamine is abundant in this. It smells so…euphoric! Sparkling, happy, fun, vacationey…I love Roses de Chloe but this…this is joy in a bottle. On me this is very pure, sweet tangerine, with an undertone of gentle pink rosebuds. This will be an no all time favorite!",02/22/22 17:26,Tovah
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Love this fragrance! I like it so much better than Chloe EDP. It is a beautiful mix of the citrus and rose components. I don't smell the cedar only citrus and rose. The opening is so bright and gorgeous! Smells great on the scent strip as well as on my skin. In a way, I blind bought a bottle because I only smelled it on the scent strip so I went to Sephora again today to test it on my skin. I am so happy that it worked out for me. I know other people may think differently but this is a successful blind buy for me.",02/06/22 16:30,Jasmine Joy

Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I enjoyed the bright fruitiness of this perfume, but a warning if you’re going to be around people with allergies— I started to cough and felt my throat get hoarse soon after putting it on, and it was bad enough that I had to wash it off after about 10 min, then I was fine. I’m not sure what caused this reaction as I have never had a perfume make me cough like that before.",01/24/22 10:29,Jska09
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"This is a huge improvement on the original, and I liked the original, which was my signature scent from its release in 2008 for about three years. I can definitely smell the roses and the tangerines, which serve to brighten and freshen the scent, but the Chloe DNA is still there. Really happy to have this in my collection.",01/12/22 11:23,MsFCAS
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"This one is no mystery which I appreciate. It is exactly what it says it is- Chloe EDP with a juicy tangerine and a hint of blackcurrant that I have to try really hard to detect. Since I like Chloe EDP just fine and really like a sweet citrus, I do enjoy this but it probably doesn't last beyond an hour and there's nothing interesting about it. Still, I appreciate that it brought the tangerine/rose combo to the forefront of my mind and I'll now be seeking out some scents with this profile.",01/06/22 12:45,tippytee
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I've currently got Chloe EDP on one wrist and Chloe Rose Tangerine on the other. They're definitely similar but Rose Tangerine is far better in my opinion.

I've never been a huge fan of the original. It's way too soapy and bitter. It burns the back of my throat when I smell it. Rose Tangerine, on the other hand, is like they took the original, removed the bitterness I don't like, and then added some juicy citrus. It's absolutely lovely, like Chloe had a glow up.

If you don't like the original, give this a try!",01/02/22 23:40,milkyjoa
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"A very citrusy and refreshing take on rose. It perfectly captures both rose and tangerine essences-if a rose and a tangerine had a baby, this would be it.

Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I was so disappointed in this fragrance. On paper, it's everything I love, but on *me* it becomes an unpleasant ""green"" fragrance. I lose the nice citrus rose from the tester, and it turns into something that I can only describe as being similar to old deodorant that has turned. Hope you have better luck than me!

Update February 2022: Tried it again today by accident (reached for the wrong Chloe). At first sniff I though, ""this isn't as bad as I remember,"" and I continued to get dressed excited to test this scent. Well, before leaving home I realized that I made a huge mistake. I think the problem isn't that the tangerine"" isn't bright or even fresh enough for my taste, but that it actually smells a bit old or rotten to my nose. I LOVE citrus scents, so I'm still really disappointed in this one.",11/24/21 10:16,nickinicole
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"clean and fresh, but does not last, I kept wishing it had just a bit more. the tangerine is weak and overpowered by the rose making it more peony. I wouldn't repurchase.",11/02/21 15:26,chakukan
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"To my nose this smells like walnut with a hint of black currant. No rose, no tangerine, very little rose, there seems to be a bit of original chloe DNA in the background but it's really far.

Man, how come noone mention this smells like walnut??? To my nose this is totally realistic walnut, especially in the opening. It's nice sweet smell but I don't think the name reflects the smell well. Smells like niche fragrance, very specific. I imagine it could be like some imaginary Tom Ford Walnut Garden, or something like that. I also think it's unisex, that walnut gives it a confident ""I'm doing what I want"" vibe.

I'm giving rating OK because I don't know what do with that scent, but if you want confidence boosting walnut scent with floral background this is it.

From what I read other people say here I almost think that I smelled the wrong perfume, but this is just what I'm getting from scent strip at Douglas...",10/26/21 10:09,Monke go brr

Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I grabbed a sample of this because I love the Chloe EDP and Roses de Chloe. This tangerine version smelled very citrusy and sharp on paper, so I wasn't expecting to like it. However, it's really lovely on the skin. It's a warmer version of Roses de Chloe to me. It smells very summer-y, I get lots of coconut at the top even though that's not listed as a note. It has a bit of a sunscreen smell, but still has the light fresh floral quality of the other Chloes. I'm surprised no other reviews mention this smelling beachy or sunscreeny because that is EXACTLY what I get from this fragrance. It actually reminds me of any generic ""beach"" fragrance but heavy on the rose. Perhaps I'm just associating the orange notes with sunscreen?

Like the Roses de Chloe EDT, this is overpriced considering the longevity you get. It starts to fade after about 2 hours, then lingers as a skin scent for another few hours. The scent is FBW but I wouldn't pay full price.",06/14/21 08:19,clairesque
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I was so eager to buy something fresh, citrusy and rosy for upcoming summer season and I expected this one to be perfect. Sadly, it’s not! No tangerine/ citrus )not for me at least), rose is faint and not the one I’m used to in Chloe perfumes. The longevity is extremely poor - after 30 minutes I can barely smell anything. It was a blind buy for me and it was a fail so I strongly advise you to smell it before buying (I wish I did…).",06/08/21 09:09,Mag_Mags

I prefer the freshly cut rose smell to this orangey smell.",04/19/21 22:44,Fleur divina
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"To be honest I couldnt stand this perfume. I got about 30 minutes in and gave up, deciding to wash it off. When i got the sample I didnt have the highest hopes. Mainly because while years back I really liked Chloé, I revisited it recently and found i just wasnt a fan anymore. It was coming off sharp on me for some reason. Well the same thing happened here. Very sharp and astringent smelling from the onset. I kept waiting for it to settle, hoping it was the top notes causing the issue but it remained sharp. (Maybe its my chemistry??) It still has a very similar smell to the original Chloe. So I feel like if you like that perfume and dont mind a strong orange citrus twist added to it you may like it. (That was really all i could smell from it: chloe+sharp tangerine) But for me its a hard pass. And full disclosure I dont seek out citrus scents often, just not a big fan.",04/09/21 18:58,EmilyMRI

Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"A lovely crisp rose scent, the initial fruit burst of tangerine and berries last just a few minutes but it adds sweetness and makes it very youthful. The cedar note makes it feel very clean. I have trouble to perceive the amber here. Transparent, clean, uplifting and very pretty. I think this is a very casual and relaxed scent, nothing groundbreaking here. A safe gift for an energetic lady. Projection and longevity are both moderate.",04/02/21 15:21,aspirina
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I think Rose Tangerine is a better, more updated version of Roses de Chloe. I love the scent of the latter, as it smells like fresh dewy pink roses, but the longevity leaves something to be desired at the end of the day. Tangerine, somehow, does seem to hold onto the skin better. Scent-wise, they are about 90% similar to my nose--tangerine is a bit zestier, with a little more bounce, while Roses de Chloe is a little more single-note. I've gotten back into rose scents a little lately, so I am glad that I've gotten to smell this one. I can see now why Roses de Chloe has been pushed to the side, and I think it was smart of Chloe to launch this as its own scent rather than just reformulate Roses.",03/14/21 12:11,pleasuretoburn
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Opens with sweet tangerine rose, just as the name suggests. However, the tangerine note fades quickly, and the rose takes on a touch of that soft plantish spice roses acquire as they begin to droop and wither: just a faint mineral tickle in the nose.

For a bit during the dry down there’s also a minor plastic-y note—a tangy synthetic smoothness, like a lighter and friendlier version of the rose in Le Labo Baie Rose 26. It vanishes after half an hour, though, and about an hour in the rose becomes quite green.

The woody base is smooth and dry throughout—almost powdery, even.

To me, Chloe Rose Tangerine is fine. It’s pretty, spring-y, work-safe, wedding-safe. It’s dainty jewelry and morning sunshine and a pinkish-nude lip. It's too innocuous for my personal taste, but certainly nice enough.",03/01/21 18:28,ginandrice
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"This is very interesting if you’re used to the line. Light, fresh, clean... as one would guess. It has a very fresh, fruity note that changes the composition. Sillage is very low but still has presence. I like it. 7/10",02/24/21 05:19,floralfragrance
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I love it, this is currently my signature spring fragrance. All notes there are so gorgeous - tangerine, black currant and strong sharp cedar opening.

Still I love this fragrance so much I invested in a full size product.",01/26/21 07:11,kobylnice

Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Sampled as part of the Sephora Favorites Perfume Sampler.

I want to like this, as it smells quite nice in both the opening and the first few minutes of dry down. I get nice fresh rose first and foremost, and then a background of faint tangerine and sparkling wine, like a bougie mimosa.

Unfortunately, about ~20 minutes after dry down, it's straight up gone. I know that an EDT isn't going to last as long as an EDP the vast majority of the time, but damn dude, not even 45 minutes? The extremely weak longevity takes what would be a solid ""like"" from me and turns it into just an ""ok"".

I'll save the rest of my sample for warmer weather and see if the longevity improves then.",01/17/21 13:34,Tolkashutka
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"This is my first Chloé perfume and as a rose lover I really like it. To me it mainly smells like rose, I'm surprised no one has mentioned that this has an element of powder. I don't really get the tangerine in this. This honesty reminds me of Amazing Grace Ballet Rose but slightly fruity and powdery. This was a blind buy and I dont regret it but the staying power is my problem with this, it's weak.",01/07/21 09:50,DandelionVonSunshine
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Testing this in the winter (almost) with an inside temperature of 64 degrees F. Two sprays on my right arm.
The tangerine is lost on me. It just is NOT there. I get rose, fresh, in your face, sparkling rose with a hint of some woodiness that is keeping this from making me queasy. I love rose but I guess it needs to be tempered with other notes that I notice because this is just too, too much. I'm getting no citrus, black currant or amber warmth.

Now almost an hour has gone by and this is more palatable to my nose. But that is mainly because the scent is disappearing. It hasn't morphed into anything more on me, just faded quite a bit. I am betting that within the hour, it will be *poof*--all gone. I own Solinotes Rose and I would rather wear that than this one. This is a ""dislike"" for me as the rose is just too ""there"" to be enjoyable. My husband says ""It isn't horrible but you have a lot of other perfumes that are nicer and not as harsh."" Then he sneezed. I wore Noir Extreme last night and he loved that one (for frame of reference).

After another 10 minutes I have decided to scrub this one off. Not my cup of tea or vase of roses, if you will.",12/17/20 11:21,NanaGram54
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I got a bit roped into trying this by a nice sales lady pushing product, but I ended up loving it. I didn't buy it as I wanted to see how it would wear all day rather than going off ten minutes, but now that I have worn it this is going on my wish-list.

For me, the opener was a fresh and dazzling tangerine scent, but with the citrus elements balanced by a hint of rose and a slight meatier scent I couldn't place (possibly the black current.) Over the hours it balanced really well, into a soft tangerine that didn't come off as tropical but feminine, mixed with a stronger rose vibe like pressed petals that I loved - I almost went back right then to grab a bottle. Over six hours later the scent was still very nice, though the sillage had decreased and I needed to get a few inches from my wrist to pick it up. But it had changed again, to a more down to Earthy, warm, woody citrus. It was very calming, and unique to anything I've tried (I think this is the first Chloe perfume I've tried at all.) It easily lasted over eight hours, though near the end it was a very close Earthy scent with just a hint of orange.

I loved it start to finish though, and found it unique and surprising. It felt a lot more 'well-thought-out' than many perfumes I have tried, with a story from beginning to end that I found captivating. It managed to start feminine and bright, flirty but not seductive, then move to refined and confident, and finally evolve into something mature and relaxing.",12/15/20 18:00,jenaigoss

the opening is similar to when you open a pair of new shoes in their box, not leather, but that (not terrible) 'shoe' scent+box.
let it be for an hour, and oh my, you have a make upy, dense, rosey, clean, delight.

perhaps its the cedar and berry, tangerine in the opening which on my skin is weird, sniffing the nozzle is very nice, a tangeriney- bright non dry citrus, clean, powdery, dry rose. skin its not. i think its me, i had the same issue with another chloe.

the rose part itsself reminds me of the absolute.
its dense, dry, make up powdery, rose. about an hour previous i kinda got vibes like i do from a YSL paris flanker i have which is all stems and rose branch - you gotta have a really good nose to feel the rose (or, again, could just be my charming skin).

If I have to distinguish the two, I would say the dry-down of this is a frosted fruit candy, while the other smells more starchy and creamy.

I love exploring the flankers of the original chloe edp which I love but unfortunately seems to be worn by literally everyone around me. So far I prefer, in this order, l'eau de chloe (the green one, earthy and interesting), roses de chloe (beautiful vibrant rose), chloe edt (clean soapy rose) and chloe l'eau (the light pink one, watery lychee rose) all more than rose tangerine.

The longevity is on par with the original, longer than l'eau.",11/11/20 14:55,Treslicious

Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"The first notes released by spraying it from the bottle are exactly those of Chloé, this has already been highlighted and I agree.
Then something happens, the fragrance warms, dries, almost of dry foliage and light dust.
Rose disappears completely. That is, it is ideally represented by the stems and leaves.
Tangerine takes place of the rose. But don't think about the taste of juicy mandarin but rather imagine the moment in which it's peeled, that slightly bitter scent dissolved while fills the air.
As its suspended mid air for hours, like it never completely blends with the skin, this allows it freshness like just sprinkled.
I love Chloé immensely, I thought it could never be outclassed, and I thought that until I met Rose Tangerine, and its being simply superb.",10/16/20 14:11,masako_30
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I really like this flanker. The opening was very green and grassy but this isn’t supposed to be a green fragrance at all, oddly enough. When it dries down, it’s just a soft, pleasant, classy, citrusy but not sharp, and not too sweet fragrance. It’s not mind blowing or anything but if you like fresh roses then it’s a great one. I prefer it to the original Chloé EDP. I think I also prefer it to Stella which is also a similar sort of fragrance but more sour and citrusy. I can definitely see myself using this year round. I can’t seeing it offending anyone so it’s the kind of fragrance that can be worn to work. Great for the daytime and warm weather especially.

among
sweet, oil-like, nasty rose and rather sharp cedar.
I have expected so much more from Chloé, sigh... And I want that honey-like, juicy, sweet tangerine so badly. Some other fragrance, I guess...
Must be the first of their roses I dislike (and first Chloé's fragrance whatsoever). Even the paper seems not to be dry enough to carry this scent beautifully, it just ruins that rose making it greasy, dominant and the whole composition imbalanced leaving everything else very sad and flat shampoo foam like; it was even worse on my quite sour/semi-oily skin. It developed nicely on my stiffened cotton shirt cuffs though. Be warned (and try it on the skin).",09/16/20 02:49,Liene

Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I LOVE this scent, it is so gorgeous and sophisticated. Very soft and feminine. I have been wearing it for work until my bottle ran out today; which brings me to my next point: Sadly, the longevity is very poor, I had to keep spraying and dousing myself all day long to feel like I was actually wearing any perfume and thus used up a 50 ml bottle in less than 2 weeks. I love the opening and the dry down, but on me it lasts maybe 30 mins tops. When I spend that amount of money on perfume, I need and want good performance. I love Chloè so much, I use the Signature EDP and the L'eau as well, and they perform much better. The other flankers such as Fleur and Roses de Chloè don't last on me either, so I really wish they would create some intense versions of their Chloè signatures soon, as the scents in all of them are so gorgeous, feminine and sophisticated.

Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"I love all things Chloe, specially their jewelry and fragrances. Now this one is not my favorite. Ended up being too citrusy for me, kind of like when you have so much grapefruit zest in a fragrance that is turns bitter/ smells a bit like BO. The rose note is fresh and delicate like the previous renditions, and lots of people will love it. It just didn't work for me. The citrus part reminds me of Guerlain Aqua Allegoria Pamplelune. The ad is gorgeous, and the model is heartbreakingly beautiful.",09/01/20 23:28,KBreckenridge
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"My favorite perfume of all time is Chloe and Chloe rose so I bought this as soon as it came out without even trying it and I'm so glad that I did.

I'm really not going to go and to it because their review before me explained it perfectly But I can't get enough of this beautiful scent.

It smells just like Chloe rose but the dry down is citrus. It is beautiful.

So I marked this as low longevity Because I can't smell it after 15 minutes. I am constantly re spraying but it is so good that it's worth it. Another thing I'd like to mention is that I could be nose blind to Chloe because I wear it so often so take that with a grain of salt.

I recently purchased DE Marly delina And I thought I would never find anything that I liked more then the way that smelled on my skin. That is in toll this period in a way they somehow remind me of each other a little bit. I don't know what they share notes and I am a novice but they are a little similar to my nose.",08/30/20 17:56,waskotransportation
Chloé Rose Tangerine Chloé,"Rose Tangerine has the classic fresh roses from Chloe. The DNA is there.
The scent opens with bright fresh lush pink roses and pulpy tangerine
bits. It’s not a zesty tangerine opening, nor as sparkling with bubbling feel so worry not
about being too “ginger ale”. The pulpy bits are short lived. Now the roses aren’t as bright and fresh, but more settled with faint of orange peel.. The cedars and amber are more of a supporting role here to prevent the tangerine from becoming too tangy or sour.
Interesting combo for sure and does not scream of cloying sweet rose.
It’s crisp but not zesty, tenderly sweet but not cloying. Woodsy green finish give it a more grown up feel that is not overly heavy(not a typical patchouli amber bomb). I’m in love with the dry down. Glad it did not turned soapy or powdery!
Projection is mild, but I’m a light sprayer!

Oh, how I miss this one. See By Chloé wasn’t just a perfume, it was a mood bubbly, flirty, effortlessly pretty. Every time I wore it, I felt like the main character in a soft-focus Parisian daydream. Compliments? Constant. It wrapped around me like a halo, and people always asked what I was wearing. The apple blossom here was magic. And then, just like that… it got discontinued …. WHY do they always take the best ones away? It still lives rent-free in my heart, and no dupe has ever come close. Truly one of my most missed scents.

See By Chloé Chloé,"For years, it was my signature scent, and I still remember falling in love with it when they handed out samples with a newspaper. It was my first real perfume, and I’ll never stop appreciating it.
The fact that it’s been discontinued is honestly very sad. I’ve discovered other perfumes I liked since then, even loved a few—but none of them ever reached the same level or created that special bond you have with your siganture scent.
I can only hope that one day I’ll find something similar…",04/05/25 06:07,Elali
See By Chloé Chloé,"I'm so incredibly sad that they discontinued this fragrance, it was my signature scent for years and I have yet to find anything like it since.

The initial scent is light, fresh, floral and sweet, uber feminine. But the dry-down is this absolutely incredible bedroom skin-like musk that lingers all day but people can only smell it when close to you. People would literally lean in just to smell me, and it was popular with the guys haha!

Chloe has since come out with a kind of ""See 2.0"" with Chloe Intense in the red packaging as that one has a similar apple top note and musk dry down but it's not at all the same :(

If anyone has smelled anything similar to See by Chloe pls let me know!!",09/28/24 17:48,meelonpaanty

See By Chloé Chloé,"In my pursuit of acquiring a powdery floral perfume, I impulsively blind-bought this. This has been in my collection for years; the bottle is pretty!
The initial impression is of crisp, juicy apples intertwined with ylang-ylang, imparting a green and earthy quality until it gradually transitions into a powdery floral essence. I like layering this with Zara's Lightly Bloom.

It is perfectly suited for spring and summer, and its longevity is good, lingering on the skin for 6-7 hours. The fragrance's sillage is restricted to a personal bubble; only those in close proximity can catch a subtle whiff. I love the interplay of sandalwood, vanilla, and musk in the base notes. I've added this to my list of perfumes I need to finish this year.",02/01/24 10:41,Makeup Discourse

See By Chloé Chloé,"Ah! Beautiful fragrance, that takes me back.

See by Chloé was the signature scent of my early 20's! I remember sniffing a magazine ad for it and immediately set out on a journey to find her.

She was the first perfume I used that made me feel like an adult: put together and confident, yet still young and carefree. I wore See all year round, but back then I lived in a much cooler climate, so I'm not sure how she'd fare in the hot weather.

I would say it's a warm, dark, and lightly sweet apple scent. Like drinking warm apple juice by a fire, but you're in a cool dark cave and it's raining outside, so it's still fresh somehow. One of my all time favorite fragrances, I was so sad that they discontinued it. But luckily I still have a bottle to sniff when I'm feeling nostalgic.",12/29/23 23:18,savannahlucille

See By Chloé Chloé,"APPLE-BLOSSOM NECTAR. I used to have a view of an ornamental crab-apple tree from my patio. Every year around Mother's day it would be covered in pink blossoms for a few days. Then one year it was struck by lighting which split it in two, and it had to be cut down. There's something about this scent that hooked me when it first came out in 2012. It was how I wanted to smell at the time, because it seemed to represent a version of myself where losses were recovered. Even now, testing the treasured last 5ml of the second bottle I went through (although I may have a roller-ball or two), I can imagine the pink blossoms filling the patio view.

Opens with a burst of apple-blossom - which is the star of the show here - supported by multi-faceted bergamot to help elaborate fruity aspects to the floral-apple and lend a faint citrus tone to the background. That deepens into the floral heart of jasmine & ylang with powdery, musky, sweet, white & yellow floral tones, all resting on a musky sandalwood-vanilla base. Overall I get a well blended floral-apple that starts fresh & faintly citrus but dries down powdery and sweeter to a floral nectar with vanilla & sweet-sandalwood tones. The floral nectar here is almost honey but doesn't have the animalic or near-beeswax notes normally associated with honey. Average or slightly above average performance.

Sadly this has been discontinued, but people change and grow, and losses become a part of who we are, rather than something to be denied. Now as I sniff my wrist I'm finding this evolves to a nearly uncomfortable sweetness. I look out my patio window through my unobstructed view and ask myself, 'Did I spray it once or twice?'... Still, if you happen to find a roller-ball of this for a reasonable price, enjoy!",08/07/23 04:40,suzanne_ronald

It smells the same as it did in 2012, It smells of skin in the sunshine, cream-covered skin, sunshine, and air. Evokes that feeling of coziness when you're lying on the grass or sitting in the sun, feeling soft, relaxed and happy.

See By Chloé Chloé,"Okay so my signature sent is chloe. I love the Soapy Rose. I've been going through my perfume collection and trying to sell a lot of it that I don't reach for anymore. I just don't have the space and I own far too many bottles. I've been picking about 4 a week to sell.
I bought a 2.5 oz bottle of this perfume when it first came out so it's pretty old. I had about 75% of it remaining. All that I was really thinking about is that I haven't reached for it in many years. I looked up that going price and it was a couple hundred dollars for one in my condition. I listed it as vintage for 115 and it sold right away.
As soon as I printed the label and went to package the product I got a whiff of the perfume and sprayed it one time on my wrist. By this time it's too late but I don't remember it being this beautiful. It was the best thing I've smelled in years and I've just sold it. I went ahead and packaged it and mailed it and ever since then have thought about it constantly.
If anybody has a bottle that they're willing to sell me a travel size decant, i would be very grateful. I would like to try to buy the equivalent of the size of a Rollerball if I can ever find if I can ever find it. That's kind of ridiculous that I just sold it and then realized how great.
There is just nothing like it that I've ever smelled. I came on here today to look to see what people are saying smells similar. The only thing that I see here is that one by oriflame and I checked online and there's only one online for sale and it's just as expensive as buying a vintage bottle of this.
You know what I don't understand about perfume companies in general is why they produce something this beautiful or a perfume that is a great seller and beloved by so many and then they choose to discontinue it? The worst part is they discontinue it forever. I can see taking it off the market for a few years, but bring it back. Instead, Chloe keeps on selling the ones that are not unique and beautiful that people aren't buying like Chloe absolu. Why would they keep on producing something like that but discontinue this beauty? Even cosmetic companies have been known to re-release certain bestsellers, even up to 10 years after the first release. That happened with Mac Whisper of guilt. The highlighter was selling for like $300 because it was so great and hard to find and then they just re-released it. Very smart. I was Chloe would do the same.
I love how the apples you can smell practically all the way through. Most perfumes that smell like Apple, only do so in the very beginning and that smell is fleeting. Not with this one.",05/27/23 12:38,waskotransportation

See By Chloé Chloé,"This fragrance is YUMMY. It gives that nostalgic feel of walking through an apple orchard when you were a kid. I would actually prefer this scent in a form of a body spray that you can reapply during the day, as I find it quite one-dimensional and not getting much on my skin once the apple scent dies down. Because of this it's not an everyday scent for me, but nevertheless the initial notes are lovely. Definitely an early spring daytime fragrance",04/04/23 23:55,prax
See By Chloé Chloé,"Meh. There were two distinct phases for me when wearing this one. First phase, which lasted about 3-4 hours, was a full blast of fruity apples upon apples, which was surprising to me because I could hardly detect the jasmine (and I'm a jasmine lover). Then it dries down to this musky vanilla (while retaining this light apple fruitiness), which lingers as a skin scent. The dry down is quite pleasant, but I'm not a fruity scent lover, so this is a definite pass for me. I can see the appeal of this fragrance for others though. Overall, this scent lasted around 5-6 hours on me until it became ever so faint.",03/08/23 15:09,stella.cherie

See By Chloé Chloé,"this fragrance is very pleasant and nostalgic for me. I am surprised to see that it came about in 2012, as I would have suspected it of being from 200 or so. The apple blossom top note is very mid-90's Herbal Essences shampoo and White Rain hair mousse to me. The bergamot is cheerful and keeps things bright, I would consider this a spring or summer fragrance.

I get a little bit of the musk and ylang ylang after a while, but it's soft. Sillage is limited to your own little personal bubble, this is a good choice for the office or for doctor's appointments when you aren't looking to offend anyone. Based on the brightness and retro vibes the fragrance gives off, it sort of reminds me of Cacheral Promesse, even though there are no berry notes in this one. To me this smells like something that a younger person in 2006 would have worn.

See is a musky-sweet white floral with a juicy bite of apple. It's soft-seeming like velvety flower petals but still strong, assertive in its femininity. Incredibly long-lasting, at first sniff I thought ""Oh no, this is the type of scent that fades away quickly"".. a polite barely-there floral like Allure or Baiser Vole.. but no, See makes a statement.

2) I had my eyes OPEN for a good Chloe because in the summer ; Chloe Narcisissy (sp?) was in abundance and I wanted to TRY IT! Months go by and the Chloe Train don't stop here no more at T.J. Asswipe Junction. Boo hoo.

3) Today I see Chloe See and read (on HERE) all the (mostly inane and dented) reviews calling this ""Generic Yet Incredible"" , ""Cozy but No Identity"" and ""Come Pee Pee on my Moo Moo"". . Or some such garbage. I have no idea what these people are talking about. As Archie Bunker once said ""They're the kind of people that keep fruit in the house even when nobody's sick"".

A light fruity FRAPPLE (fruit & apple to you, waffle hips) with a musk dry-down . This is ONLY a few notches UP from any dopey ""celebrity"" spritz it shares VALUABLE rack space with next to the

The MUSK is above average. The Apple scent is above average. The projection is BELOW average - like worse than a can of scented hairspray.

My skin doesn't really project any floral note in this and I find it hard to detect any. Its just fresh and fruity for me.

Something creamed emerges in the dry down- sandalwood/vanilla? Very charming! Just sweet enough but not syrupy or cloying.

After purchasing and wearing for a few weeks however, I think it's the other way around. It is fresh, fruity and sweet, but has a lovely powdery, pink petal overtone to it that adds maturity and complexity, keeping it far and away from smelling like it belongs in a high school class room in my opinion. It is a perfect daytime fragrance for spring and summer, an automatic mood lifter- I don't know how anyone couldn't be cheerful wearing this!- and when you can find 2.5 oz at TJ Maxx for $20, is a bit of a no brainer, even for a blind buy.",04/24/17 07:11,Violinplayah

I don't smell any musk, but if there is any, it is so well-blended and clean that it only makes the whole combo nice and round - nothing else. Vanilla is very natural and delicate, it soon disappears. Gardenia reappears in the base notes, after a short departure in the heart notes. Ylang-ylang unfortunately emerges after half an hour and this is the headache-inducing bit of the perfume.
Still, it's a big discovery for me and a ""must-have"" for June!!! It will be just perfect for a dinner in the blooming garden or for a romantic walk in the nature!",02/26/17 10:18,LadyPilot

See By Chloé Chloé,"Before this fragrance, I use to avoid all sweet fragrances since I always associated them with cheap & childish scents. This definitely changed my mind about them.

It's a sweet fragrance but toned down just enough for those who hate sweet fragrances as it allows the other notes to come through (tone down the sweetness + add a bit of maturity) I find. It's also perfect for those who love sweet fragrances as the sweetness is still present enough for them to enjoy. The dry down is just lovely. The vanilla here is done/used so well, way better than Armani's Si (eau de parfum) which I sadly no longer want to use after getting this.",01/08/17 11:50,mmm_331

See By Chloé Chloé,"Summary: sweet fruity floral, pretty enough and not nauseatingly sweet, though I would rather it would be a little less sweet.

---

Interesting enough. Fruity and sweet (yup, it does remind you of yellow apples), and simultaneously a sort of abstract floral. I cannot recognize the specific flower notes, just the vague idea of flowers.

It's actually quite pretty and well-done in a simple way, just not exactly to my personal taste. I would wear it if offered, but for me it lacks something. Maybe some lemon-y note?

So honey (I had creamed honey and this reminds me of it, clover it orange? It's not spicy but it gives me the idea of cinnamon on honey not sure why).

See By Chloé Chloé,"Is it possible for a fragrance to be ""bubbling"" and ""crispy""? This one proves it is.

It starts very spring-like and youthful, with notes of juicy apple, apple blossoms and lots of musk, which gives the fragrance intensity and that ""something else"" that wouldn't be there without its presence. Soon after, ylang ylang and vanilla notes render the fragrance sweeter and kind of ""caramelized"", making it a little bit warmer. Even so, as it has a discreet sillage, the fragrance doesn't disturb on days with higher temperatures.

This is one of the fragrances that make us feel clean and fresh, as if we just have had a shower. Soft, inoffensive, great for wearing on a daily basis and perfect for people who get annoyed by ""showy"" fragrances. And, for such a discreet perfume, the longevity is excellent, of almost 10 hours.",06/22/16 15:43,andreas73

See By Chloé Chloé,"This seems to be a bit of a chameleon - as if it changes its color on everyone who wears it. For the life of me (it's been a long time, folks), I can't remember another fragrance I've ever worn that goes through such a complete transformation.

At first 'See' was not particularly appealing to me (powdery, rich white musk and fruity-melon), so I was pleasantly surprised when it became an entirely different creature as it dried down. On my skin, 'See' warms to freshly cut vanilla bean and maple syrup with a touch of new leather. This scent then morphs entirely; lingering as the citrusy wild bergamot that grows in my yard, dewy springtime grasses, a bit of warm sandalwood and some element that reminds me of freshly baked cardamom bread.

Soft enough to wear any time and appropriate for any age, 'See' is safe gift choice. Sillage is minimal - even when I brazenly spray it everywhere after a shower. Its longevity always catches me off guard. Just when the scent seems to have vanished, I'll catch a warm unexpected hint of something delicious that - aha! - I believe I've just identified:

Steaming basmati rice with saffron.
Peculiar, but that's it!

While searching for original 'Chloe', I blind bought a 2.5 oz/75 ml 'See' EDP tester on ebay for pennies on the dollar. In a few month's time, I've nearly emptied the lovely bottle. Not at all disappointed with the fragrance (especially considering the incredibly low price paid), I might purchase again at a good markdown, but probably not at full retail.",05/28/16 10:54,2Dwoods

It's primarily a sweet floral but the apple note is present through to the dry down, though the note itself changes a lot along the way.

Apples, jasmine, musk and vanilla. Starts of crisp and bright with apples and musk. Jasmine is quite strong yet pristine and clean. Vanilla rounds everything out ever so gently. Chloe See is not at all complicated yet sometimes it is all I need. It's fresh, floral, airy, and a sheer veil of sweetness. I would like to wear this perfume while my hair is still wet and go outside in the sun. Which does remind me, this smells like shampoo, but in the best way possible.

When Victoria Secret Pink came out with a fragrance and body line, my favorite scent was Fresh & Clean. Getting older and wanting something a little more sophisticated and longer lasting with the same feel, Chloe See is fits the slot perfectly. Wearing Chloe See gives me a youthful feeling like I had when I wore VS Fresh&Clean in college without being childish.

Also, something about this does remind me of a 90's perfume. for as simple as this is, It is understated yet lovely and one of my favorite perfumes.",04/19/16 04:45,Pepperflower

This fragrance is sparkling and innocent, and that is why i love it so much. it's quite ingenue. something i can see young parisian ladies wearing around the streets while out shopping in the spring! it's really lovely, sweet, and romantic, but not seductive, mysterious, or sexy.

See By Chloé Chloé,"This perfume is one of my favorites. After using up half the bottle, it may be time for a review. I got this back in winter 2013 at the after Christmas sales on a holiday trip. My dad offered to buy this for me, which makes it even more special!

I must admit that I didn't start using this until winter 2014. I was kinda put off by See for a while. I smelled See on a college friend, but I didn't realize it was See. I smelled a synthetic Apple/musky weird scent that seemed to last and last AND last. I finally asked what fragrance she had began wearing and she told me See. I was shocked! Not MY See by Chloe? Can't be?

Finally, last winter I decided to pull See from its box and test it on my skin. I thought it was lovely! Definitly Apple and floral. But in a unique way. I don't think I've smelled another perfume like See. It's hard to confuse it with something else. Which I love about it! I wore it a few times and asked my husband and brothers (brutally honest critics) what they thought of it. They said it was nice. My hubby loves it! When I was still living with my mom, she would steal a spritz or two every now and then. It smells awesome on my mom as well. I believe chemistry is a major factor with this fragrance.

I tried See in summer since it seems like more of a summer scent but I think it smells a whole lot better in cooler weather. I realized I LOVE wearing this scent when I wear my leather jackets. The unique smell of See combined with the smell of leather smells sexy to me! (I don't spray my perfume on my leather jackets btw!) I can't wait for the cooler weather to come around so I can start wearing this again.

""Hmmm, that's pleasant"", you're thinking. ""This might be my next favourite perfume"". After 15-20 minutes, when you sniff your wrist again in an attempt to find out what the next notes are, you find out it's all gone. SWOOSH. Like the 50€ bill you payed for it at the store. All that is left is sorrow, dissappointment and dispair, and a REALLY faint scent that you can vaguely intuit if you press your nose really hard against your skin while inhaling madly.

Which I quite like, there's no great depth to this perfume, does last ok, it's by no means a ""wow"" perfume but that's ok!! I do like it alot would I repurchase??

See By Chloé Chloé,"It smells like apple. It's not the same strong synthetic apple as the Be Delicious line, it's a gentler apple, appropriate for daytime or work. This one is fresh, playful, and fruity, so if that's what you're into, this might be good for you. It might not be for you if you don't like the idea of smelling like shampoo, because the apple blossom really is the most dominant note by far, so that and the low sillage can sometimes come across as shampoo-y.

It lasts 3-4 hours, but it's only really noticeable to others for the first hour or two. It works just fine to freshen up partway through the day, but I wish it lasted a little longer.",08/24/14 20:21,dorseyhorsey

I loved it so much I had to buy the whole set. The opening is a fresh burst of appley goodness, and the dry down doesn't change that much, it remains fresh and pretty on my skin. I love this scent. The bottle is gorgeous and so is the packaging. Bright and happy, very much like the scent. A very good updated version of the traditional heavy florals of the old Chloe line.

This is one of those under-ripe apples that is a chore to eat, that you eat because you packed it in your lunch and it's supposed to be good for you. I also get a little bit of powder, which I am guessing was supposed to soften the sharp apple, but I happen to hate powdery smells. I am disappointed by this scent.",08/08/14 22:39,annarox
See By Chloé Chloé,"I literally wanted this fragrance because of the commercials. They looked so fun!! But I had never really smelled the fragrance before, UNTIL TODAY. I went to the mall today to hit a couple of perfume stores and when I was at macy's I recognized it from the commercials, and I smelled it and I was like ""yeesssssss"" it is amazing. I didn't buy it at Macy's but once I got to sephora I just HAD to get a roller ball 1.0 Oz version. AND IT. IS. AMAZING. Literally has become one of my favorite fragrances within the night. When I got home and smelled it, initially I liked it but wasn't blown away (also actually spraying perfume is so much nicer than roller balls, but it's not all bad now it can travel with me). But as the night has progressed I have fallen completely head over heels for this perfume. However, I disagree with the top notes and bottom notes listed on here. I personally smell more of a sweet and light wood on first whiff, then as it settles in I smell the apple blossom more. I love this perfume so much though. It reminds me of a nice classy British lady drinking tea and lookin really cute while doing it. I ADORE THIS FRAGRANCE AND I LOVE IT WITH ALL OF MY HEART. yum yum yum.

See By Chloé Chloé,"Oh gosh I love this! Fresh sweet crunchy red apples! Lots of them! Subtle florals, a soft clean musk and a welcoming hint of vanilla are there too...gets even better in the drydown, softer and sweeter abit more mature, but does not last that long (~5 hours on my skin). I think I love it because it smells like my beloved first perfume as a teen (Jean Arthes Amore Mio, the green bottle...now unavailable...Amore Mio was greener smelling though). It's just extremely pleasant and I could just drench myself in it...
BUT!
it doesn't smell like a Chloe...it smells...cheap....like a REALLY GOOD cheap (and non-synthetic smelling) EDT or body spray, the kind they used to release in the 90s, something you'd enjoy wearing daily, not something you'd imagine being released by Chloe and being sold at such a crazy high price. It smells like it shouldn't be sold for more than 20 to 25 bucks for the largest bottle. I feel like I can find something similar from VS or BBW, so that's where I'll look for these types of scents. I imagine that this scent is most suited to 10-16 year old girls with rich parents who can afford to keep them supplied with it. I say 10-16 year olds, because I find that this scent has a very innocent vibe to it, not young or old, just completely non-sexual, child-like and blissfully carefree.

See By Chloé Chloé,"See By Chloe is a beautiful, clean, and feminine fragrance. Whilst it retains a few qualities of a 'typical' fruity floral scent, there is something very unique about it... I can see how some people may find it a little underwhelming, but to me, See by Chloe is a simple, effortless beauty. It makes an impression without trying too hard. The overall scent has a very urban, chic and modern feel, but it is also quite vintage and romantic; very reminiscent of other, popular Chloe fragrances such as Love and Chloe Eau de Parfum.

The composition opens with bright apple blossom, which smells very fresh and light, like a warm summer breeze. It's a lovely, feminine opening, and there is something about it that makes it smell very 'perfumey'. This apple blossom note is done really well, and not necessarily how you'd expect. It's not sweet and juicy (like in many of the DKNY's Delicious fragrances); but it smells very floral, delicate and soft. It's dominant without being loud and screechy. After a while, an interesting musk note unfolds, which I guess is the tricky part of the composition. Accompanied by dry sandalwood and delicate vanilla, they create an unusual layer of quite contrasting accords. At this point, I can see how this fragrance may start bothering some people. I suppose it does smell a little bit as if you have just stepped into an old basement, but I'm not saying this as a bad point... This romantic, dusty, vintage feel is actually quite charming, and it feels very 'Chloe'. The freshness of the apple blossom (still present from the beginning)balances out the musky base, creating an unique, clean and very feminine composition. It's a harmony of old and new; – a concept so beautifully represented by the bird cage bottle design, which mirrors both modern and vintage qualities of See by Chloe.

I love this, but I still wouldn't recommend it as a blind buy. Whilst very versatile and comfortable to wear, this fragrance can be a little polarising because of the musky drydown. Just make sure you test it first, and hopefully you'll end up enjoying it as much as I do!

I don't care about the commercial where the girl looks little weird with her openened mouth or some videos...No clue what they're about. First I got bitter bergamot which disappeared in few minutes. What came than is calming, sensual smell of tea. I don't know but I smelled tea on my skin. Little like earl grey with some vanilla and apple cider. That slightly bitter smell of tea with sweet undernotes of sweet red apple and creamy light vanilla. It changed again after about half an hour when it happened to smell all like apple pie with cinammon, hints of vanilla and musk. Don't ask me how I got this, but it seems it played with my skin a very good game. Don't expect unbeliavable miracle. This fragrance is more down to earth, as a girl who wears it.
Sensual, girly, calming, reminds me of a beautiful girl with big eyes, very ambitious, young but elegant with her own style and personality.

I think so at least. It's a bit of an.. odd fragrance as well. I've heard poolwater beeing mentioned before. It has that sort of chlorine undertone. But that just makes me love it even more. Yhea. I'm also that kind of person that likes to sniff gasoline.

There's this Polish skin care brand that my mom would stock up on when we went to visit my aunt. The brand was AA but I don't remember what it stood for, just the AA logo on the bottles. Anyway, this perfume smells exactly like those products. Everyone saying it has a cosmetics type smell to it (more so skin/hair care than makeup) is absolutely right. That's what it always reminded me of too but now I finally got the specific product. I probably won't buy it but this is so nostalgic to me.",03/11/14 16:43,hanson26

It's not chlorine, and I can't think of a particular sunscreen that smells like this so I don't know what it is. Little plastic floaties on children's arms or inflatable rings perhaps. In any case it is a happy smell to me. The emotional resonance by itself is good-time, happy day. So I have to say I like it. Is this what I'm looking for in a perfume for a grown woman like myself? No, it isn't. Am I sorry I have this on my wrists on this dismal gray January day? Not at all, it's a real day brightener.

By the way, lots of people have said it reminds them of this, that, and the other thing, and I can see why they said that. Before it settled into its final form it went through so many changes I didn't know if my nose was broken or what was going on. It was astringent, then pure vanilla, then a light floral, then aftershave, then floral again, and now swimming pool. It's a whole day in a bottle!

See By Chloé Chloé,"I love the house of Chloe so I may be biased in this review. I went from sampling it to loving it and getting a full bottle. It has become my signature scent and I have over 100 bottles. Simply smells fantastic.

The scent: Unique, comforting, approachable and strives to keep things balanced. It's a restrained beauty, the scent in the cage snapped bottle is just waiting to release its beauty. This scent reminds me of the girl that is beautiful and takes care of herself and is fashionable and know how to dress. but yet sometimes downplays her beauty and dresses down and is not trying too hard to be perfect. The scent is just that! It's got the transparency crystalline quality Chloe scents possess. This quality makes it versatile. You can wear the scent any time of year anywhere and you don't have to think too hard about choosing a scent yet you know that your scent will represent you. The apple note is so beautiful blended with the floral aspect of the scent. Perfectly balanced with the woodsy dry down. I can see myself wearing this scent around Christmas time as we'll. The scent it's youthful and sophisticated but not limited to an age group.

The staying power and silage is great on me. I usually spray my clothes and hair as opposed to skin.

The bottle representative of the scent itself. Minimalist yet interesting enough to be looked at and handled. Glass is quite heavy. It's got a vintage feel to it just as the other Chloe scents.

I've used 3/4 of a bottle in a short time that's saying a lot when you've got as many bottles as I do. I can see myself buying a replacement bottle after this one runs out or a backup Bottle if found at a good price.

It's probably one of the most unique perfumes I've ever smelled, hence why I keep reviewing it and it's got my brain going in every which way. I just haven't committed to buying it yet. I'm going to try some on and ""take it for a spin"", and see how I feel about it after that. I just know after spraying it on my wrist to get a 6th, 7th, 8th... opinion about it (because it's always changing), I still find myself thinking ""mmmmmmmmm... yum"" after smelling it and how it changes over time. And don't even get me started on the ""paint a scent"" idea. I LOVE that, and I'm going to walk over to Macy's in a minute now to paint my wrist, now that this fragrance is on my damn mind again.

Long story short: I originally hated it. Now I'm infatuated with it.",09/24/13 08:44,stemziez
See By Chloé Chloé,"Tested today.I think it's a nice and inoffensive fragrance. Slightly bitter fruit in the middle phase, but once it has settled on the skin the vanilla has softened it quite a bit.

First of all I experienced the scent as the most delicious of desserts and the SA probably got tired of all my aaaah!!-s and mmmmmm!!-s. I was completely mesmerized by the scent. When I came home after an hour I took a second sniff on my wrist but then it had turned slightly bitter and I came to think of beer. (?) It´s all about body chemistry I guess. :) Thankfully, the vanilla came through after a while. So far it is a Like, not Love from me. If the initial scent had stayed throughout, I wouldn´t hesitate to buy a FB. It was that GOOD.

Update: 7 hours later the scent is still there, Very soft, very nice. No bitterness whatsoever.",09/23/13 10:06,Annica
See By Chloé Chloé,"OK, so as context as to how much I LOVE this scent, I had, LAST DECEMBER, put myself on a perfume buying BAN. I admittedly had gotten a bit ridiculous in my perfume buying habits (my tried and tested signatures are Givenchy Very Irresistible L'Intense - the antithesis of See by Chloe - and Narciso Rodriguez for Her EDT, the black bottle). Therefore, I decided that I was going to make an effort to use some of my current scents up before investing in new ones. However, as of September 17, 2013, my ban has been broken with THIS scent.
It's amazing. If you're a girl who enjoys scents that could be mistaken for a fresh masculine scent, especially in the dry down, you'll love this. On the other hand, the heart of the fragrance is so light and feminine. It really is the best of both worlds. It's one of those fragrances that will have you lifting your wrist to your nose every few minutes. One of THOSE perfumes. It really is a lovely scent, and I can't say I'm sorry that my ban was broken because this scent is WORTH IT.",09/21/13 18:25,angelic4296
See By Chloé Chloé,So I have this little vial sample in my bag and decided to try it tonight...First I get this sentimental apple blossom (my grandmother's favorite flower). It has this retro feel to it...like a scent that has sucked me back to the 70s. As it dries down it begins to transform into a fresh apple pie slice just a hint of spice and creamy vanilla ice cream sliding around on a polished wood plate. I like it...fresh & innocent.,09/19/13 14:05,Cairo Rose

See By Chloé Chloé,"It looks like I'm 0 for 2 with Chloe fragrances so far... I received a sample of this recently and, since I had already used up my available test spots for the night, sprayed it on a card first just to check it out. My first thought was it smelled *exactly* like walking into a certain store in the mall (Aerie? The Gap? One of those shops that uses a lot of lighter colored woods and wants to give off a ""clean"" vibe); and this would be just the scent that they pumped in to make all the clothes seem fresh and clean and youthful. So, it seemed relatively inoffensive, if not exciting, and I set the sample card on my nightstand and saved See for another day.

The next day, I was sitting in my bedroom and kept getting wafts of the same kind of sickly sweet, kind of rotting waxy flower note that turned me off of the regular Chloe EDP. I couldn't figure out where it was coming from until I remembered the card sitting on my nightstand--but it smelled so different from what I remember from the day before that I couldn't believe that could be the source. Another sniff seemed to prove otherwise; the horrible smell was coming from the card, which I quickly tossed into the kitchen garbage.

One day later(!), I was getting those wafts again. After briefly considering whether I was going nuts or experiencing some sort of pre-stroke event, I homed in on the sample atomizer on my dresser. It had leaked a little into its cap during shipping, so it was giving off quite a lot of scent and was indeed the source of that sickly sweet smell I kept getting.

It's odd, because See and Chloe EDP don't have any notes in common listed, but there's something about both of them that my nose just cannot stand... Cute bottle, though!",08/20/13 17:58,margoess

See By Chloé Chloé,"I smiled while reading missk's review, because what immediately came to mind when I tried Chloe See was an apple fritter! Crisp and glazed outside, with warm, soft dough and fruit inside. To me, this fragrance is more gourmand than floral. I'm a big fan of sandalwood, cinnamon, and vanilla, which are very present in this scent. It's delicious, comforting. Makes me want to sit at a corner table in a cozy coffeehouse with a latte and a big apple fritter! The presence of spicy cinnamon keeps this perfume from smelling shampoo-like, in my opinion.",07/27/13 16:35,fawnmarie
See By Chloé Chloé,"Clean bergamot with a sweet edge. Middle notes remind me of honey and the sandalwood finish is somewhat powdery and feminine.

See By Chloé Chloé,"I personally adore this fresh & crisp scent. Some people cannot wear apple based scents, but those that can will love it, on my body I get the crisp apple scent paired with the Jasmine, then a dry down of musk and sandalwood and Ylang Ylang. It does not smell like shampoo on me nor is it synthetic at all, but on some people it might be depending on their body chemistry I guess. I like it because on me it is a crisp, & fresh fragrance, great for summer & the fall. I have been complemented numerous times when I where it too, my BF likes it a lot as well, and sometimes will wear it himself, I love it on him too, it can be a unisex fragrance IMO.",07/26/13 14:39,MsDana

Today I have tested this one and it's a very interesting perfume, the scent is really extraordinary. Apple blossom gives a feeling of freshness and cleanness, so much that it alomst reminds me of shampoo!
Also, it lasts quite long, it's been over 5 hours since I have sprayed it on my wrist and it still smells with the same intense as the time I had it sprayed, at least on my skin.
I can't stop sniffing it, it's a very special scent as all of Chloe perfumes of course. Totally recommended to those who like fresh and clean scents in perfumes.",07/19/13 10:38,Athens

See By Chloé Chloé,"I could swear that See by Chloé is one of the Marc Jacobs Lola flankers poured into a new bottle. I wouldn't hold it past Coty Prestige, as there has been a lot of homogenization going on among the houses which it now rules. Fruity-floral frags one and all, with no discernible natural notes. The ""vanilla flavor"" is probably what reminded me most immediately of Lola, though it is much fainter in this composition.

I received a nice-sized test-tube vial of this fragrance (4 ml), but in this case they'd be better off sticking with the visual marketing hype so that people buy before they try. Not for me. I have not seen the bottle in person, but from a distance it looks very attractive. Hey, wait a minute: isn't it very similar to the Balenciaga Paris bottle? Now that's an interesting marketing tack: use the bottle of an already successful perfume so that the associations carry over to the new launch.

It does seem as though bottles are really the focus of the big mainstream houses these days. Alas, the golden days of perfumery appear to be behind us...",07/02/13 08:47,sherapop
See By Chloé Chloé,"I just tried this fragrance today. Even after my nighttime shower, the fragrance persists and can be smelled about 6 inches off teh surface of the skin.

On my skin, the fragrance itself quite interesting. There is a slight punch of fruit, small enough that it doesn't mess with the core of the fragrance but lends a bright positivity to it as fruits often do. The florals are chic and elegant, and the base is on the masculine side, but not too masculine that I wouldn't wear it.

This fragrance is one I would welcome in the workplace. It speaks to me of an independent, head strong woman who can and will speak for herself. She gets up in the morning and arrives to work on time, excelling at her job in a way that others do not.

I have never had the pleasure of trying Jo Malone Grapefruit myself (yet!), but from the reviews of it I imagine this would be slightly similiar to it in that it is a chic, modern scent that is slightly masculine but not enough to be deemed a unisex scent. The florals keep it feminine.",07/01/13 19:54,tinyxxangel
See By Chloé Chloé,"Very nice, clean, fresh, a little floral, and just a bit fruity scent!

Chloe See makes me smell like I went into a musky bar, and rolled on the sticky floor after ladies spilled multiple Apple infused Vodka drinks on the floor.

I can respect what others see in this scent. The bottle is beautiful, and the notes like Jasmine was sweet and ripe for a few seconds, and the Ylang Ylang may also make a lovely debut. I really wish I could do Apple Blossom scents.

So, naturelle IS a bit screechy, but only for the first 5-10 minutes. It then calms down quite a bit and in the air I would say that it's 90% See by Chloe. Nose to skin it will smell more different, a bit more fresh.

I have been craving See by Chloe and I am SO happy to have found this!

Super pretty and feminine scent - floral and bright and works all seasons.

Just like See by Chloe, it does not have a lot in common with the original Chloe Signature, even though they do share some notes. But I am sure they would layer beautifully together, I might actually try this since I also love and own the Chloe Signature.",11/01/25 06:59,Hewlett

I wore it on a slow, rainy spring/summer day that faded into the evening, and it gave me a certain feeling—soft and calm, yet still making a statement. If that makes sense?

It's very clean, cold and powdery. It reminds a little of dentists' offices at first. Maybe I'm just not used to mimosa.

After 30 minutes it softens a little more, something creamier, more comforting, more pleasant, even maternal like! It's as if there was still a rose syrup, with a little neroli and more cedar.

She — and she is definitely a she — is BRIGHT! Bubbly, in your face brightness without in a care in the world: she’s a tried and true Chloe girl.

On me, the opening notes are fresh cut grass and dewy rose petals. But it dries down into something more grown-up.

The warm honey smell from the mimosa is strong but I love that as I like sweet perfumes. I get a slight soapy clean smell too, which again I enjoy.
When I wear this, it reminds me of the summer holiday and makes me feel excited for warm weather.",12/14/23 05:04,NillaSugar
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"This wasn't the smartest buying decision on my part. When I sampled it in-store, I loved how it smelled fresh and floral without being too rose-dominant. It has a sparkling quality that I assumed would work well in hot weather. But when I opened my bottle this summer, all I could smell was celery. And since I live in a place where it is 100+ degrees every day in the summer, there's a strong scent bubble of any perfume I spray. This means I had a very strong celery aroma to everyone around me. There is a very strong and sharp note immediately upon spraying, which lasts throughout the entirety of the wear. Now that it has been a couple of months I am going to try it again and see if maybe I should use it in the winter instead of summer.",12/11/23 11:46,sajtwo
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Floral freshy with a touch of spice in the opening (rosey spice). Clean smelling without being musky or citrusy or aquatic. Not as powdery and not as rosy as the OG, I enjoy this version way more. Smells natural, not perfumey at all. Easy reach. Linens drying near rose bushes",12/02/23 12:41,tealoveZ
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"No no no. Original Chloe is my OG, my most complimented, my desert island scent, the one I’d pick if I could only own one fragrance. This is just not it for me. The added notes just destroy the clean, transparent airy floral that defines Chloe. My travel spray was sold to another unsuspecting person. I liked the other flankers, they seemed to maintain the qualities I love, but not this one, sadly.",11/09/23 13:09,Moonbeam28
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"This is one of my favorite perfumes, and by far my favorite rose perfume. it’s not very sweet or even very feminine, but something about it smells like a rainy day to me, but it’s also very rosy and elegant.",11/09/23 10:00,elshabelsh2003
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"It opens up very strangely on my skin. It smells like some kind of mixed herbs, but not in a good way. Reminds me of a bag of meat marinade with spices and herbs like basil, oregano and rhubarb. I really don't like it. Over time it turns into a nicer sparkly clean floral scent. It's even has that honey-like sweetness from blackcurrant.
Overall, it's a strong dislike from me. When I wear it, I feel like I'm at a cheap restaurant, where the smell of the preparing food is mixed with the floral cleaning products that were used for cleaning the dishes.
Also, just like most of the Chloé fragrances, I smell something very sharp and nauseating in it :(",09/23/23 18:12,Dori002
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"I bought Naturelle mistakenly when I meant to get the original Chloe by Chloe eau de parfum but I’m honestly not mad at it. They smell very similar, but Naturelle is more woody and sharp yet still soft and i have to spray a bit more, whereas OG Chloe is more smooth and bright yet loud (it projects way more) and I don’t have to spray as much. Naturelle still has pretty good lasting power. I sprayed a few sprays on my on my shirt, ran a few errands, went to sleep with the same shirt, woke up the next day and I can still smell it on my shirt and now my blanket. This is such a gooooood freshie scent and I’m a gourmand girlie through and through, but there’s something about this and OG Chloe I just can’t get enough of. I can see how people could say it gives laundry detergent, like I get it but to me it still reads as a perfume. The only singular note I pick up on is the citron which I guess is why some ppl get “bug spray”, other than that I think it’s very well blended. Can’t wait to layer it with Chloe by Chloe for a touch of woodiness and depth. 3.5/5 stars, just wish it projected more but I am still happy with this!",09/17/23 03:59,elleayjay
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Starts very green and lasts green for half an hour and theeeennn...suddenly opens up with honey! Kind of specific type of honey, very aromatic one, but not overly sweet! Interesting perfume, I like it! Longevity is medium which is ok for me.",09/15/23 11:08,grapefruit352
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,So I received a sample of this and instantly I fell in love with this fragrance. It is very special indeed. It’s almost polite in nature but very sensual at the same time. The only thing that may stop me from purchasing this perfume is that it really does not last for long on the skin. However owning a bottle of this perfume and having it just for yourself to wear to bed is almost like a heavenly thought. I think if your husband or partner smelled this on you going to bed they would actually fall in love with you all over again! That’s how good it is it’s almost sexy like it is sexy but in a polite way.,09/13/23 07:57,Bharaninakshatrababes
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"On me, this fragrance smells rosy for about a minute and then citrusy for another five minutes, and then...

Powdery green skin scent that is barely detectable unless I stick my nose right on my skin.

On test paper, this fragrance smelt wonderful. Natural and lively, but on me, it's just completely uninspired. Maybe it's got something to do with my skin chemistry, but the result is not at all the same as on the test strip.

Try before purchase, for sure. As it is, I think it's way overpriced, like some (or many?) of Jo Malone's scents.",09/05/23 05:29,washudtoj
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Apparently mimosa and I don't get along well. This is the 3rd fragrance I've sampled with that note and I've disliked all 3. The opening was ok, with a greenish light touch, but the dry down just is not pleasant, and I got to the dry down in less than 10 minutes. It didn't change for the rest of it's longevity. I'll avoid fragrances with a mimosa note in the future. Sorry, girl!",08/24/23 15:54,Savage1
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Fresh and clean rose fragrance with the backround in some cedar. Very nice and inoffensive, kind of glad that the black currant is not so promiment. The longevity is poor, it was gone in two hours. (Might be the heat)
Vibes: rosy petals in light sweetness

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Opens as a green dewey rose with an edge of spice. Smells like rose petals covered in dew. I’m noticing something sweet and almost soapy as well with a hint of citrus. It’s bringing to mind those clear bars of green rosey soaps you’d find wrapped in cellophane in a guest bathroom. It’s more pleasant than I remember the original Chloe being. For me, I always smelled a bug spray rose from the original. This one is so much more enjoyable. Neroli and cedar can sometimes bother my nose yet they’re light and inoffensive in this fragrance.",06/26/23 07:21,YourFragranceFriend
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"I haven’t tried a mainstream fragrance in a very long time. The green ribbon made me think this may be a green forward fragrance.

I sort of is. First spray I got a lot of citrus and maybe some fruit. Once it settled down, all I got was fruit. I did not get any rose at all. The fruits were apple and or melon. I had sprayed my wrists, so when I needed to wash my hands I finally got the rose. It is nice, but like a lot of mainstream fragrances",05/20/23 13:01,Can I smell this?
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,On my skin this is VERY green and clean. It’s not for me,05/02/23 11:37,amgenus2015
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Fresh and clean, it has a bright citrus opening that fades into a wearable green rose. It's not a perfume that would normally be up my alley, but I found myself reaching for it in the spring, when the trees are finally blooming and the sun is coming out. Longevity is nice, I can usually still smell it on me six or seven hours later. I would recommend getting a sample of this and not blind buying. To someone who doesn't like sharp green scents, this could definitely be overwhelming.",04/20/23 18:07,mizz_g0at
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Maybe I don't know the difference between rose and mimosa, because this smells very rose like to me. I get freshly cut roses, with the green notes of the stems and perhaps some dewdrops. Projection is pretty good, had it on for about 4 hours now and it's still present.",04/20/23 12:45,Thalianna
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Initially I was surprised at the low rating because I think this is a great, easy to wear mainstream, approachable perfume. But if you think rose is dominant, you will be disappointed.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle is a citrus rose then dries down to a light powdery mimosa. I don’t get the dreaded laundry note; to me this is a beautiful, sunny springtime floral.",04/09/23 12:17,Bubbles1964
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"It seems I don't like mimosa. I like citrus and rose so it's definitely the mimosa. I smell a strong soapy pollen with a hint of dirty socks in the background. I really think the mimosa doesn't mix well with my nose, especially with added rose. This is horrid.",03/31/23 03:07,autumnblue914
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"This perfume needs time to develop for the scent to show its velvety, yellow floral mimosa base. Mimosa is the star of the show in this one, so if you are expecting a heavy, intense rose you will be disappointed. Mimosa is powdery, soft, elegant, not something I experience in most modern perfumes I’ve sampled.

I can detect a bit of soft, astringent roses growing on a bush, with an ozonic light spring shower scent. The citron is also very light, but I think that’s what keeps this from becoming a dish soap type of scent. The woodiness in the base also connects this scent back to nature and grounds it. This perfume is expertly blended, romantic, and perfect for daytime wear or a brunch date in the spring or a cool summer evening boating on a lake.

If the original Chloe Edp is too screechy or intense for you (I enjoy it but sometimes it can be headache inducing if I don’t spray it lightly), give this one a try. Not a safe blind buy unless you are a mimosa lover and you want your scents to stay closer to the skin. I want to be able to draw my husband in for intimate moments and wear perfumes that he can snuggle into without sneezing.",03/29/23 14:01,veggiebeautycosmetics
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Wow, this is G-R-E-E-N. Fresh and green. Floral and green. Soapy and green.

I absolutely hated it on my first try but trying it a second time, it’s not that bad. As for me, it’s just not my cup of tea. I do see how someone else could find it absolutely beautiful. It’s fresh, youthful, very spring-like but… it also reminds me of a cleaning product and I agree on the unpleasant underlying sharpness…",03/11/23 13:34,ChocoLei
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Got the sample searching for a light fresh rose. Well, a fresh light rose it ain’t, and not really a rose. Rose plays like a fourth fiddle here. Scent veers strangely between artificial sweetness of hard candy with sour undertones that read heavy and soapy floral. Plus a weird and prominent oily, almost coconutty note like a body cream that is off and slightly rancid. Weird scent, for me it utterly lacks subtlety and is quite sour, straightforward and heavy-handed. I was expecting garden watercolour and got a bag of cheap sour hard candy.",03/01/23 11:43,ilgattopardo
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"I’m kind of soooo glad that I don’t like it….probably would’ve in the past nose.
I’m sure I would’ve killed for this one 10-20 years ago . It’s a very black currant scent on me.
Sillage is very good.
My nose doesn’t agree with it.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"I was listening to ""In the heat of the morning"" by David Bowie when I tried this one so it is forever linked to that song. I can't find a better reason to like it even more.

Lovely, can easily be a fresh spring daywear scent. I'm not getting mimosa nor neroli, it's rather a bit fruity if anything besides the rosey citrussy greenness.",02/10/23 01:25,Cherry_Darling
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Tried this in store on my hand and for the rest of the day, couldn’t help but bury my nose to it.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"I bought this one in spring last year and loved it for spring and early summer. I stopped wearing it in autumn but I still love the smell from the bottle itself - but when I reached for this a week ago, I smelled something way too green (a bit grassy, even?) for this time of year in the opening. The drydown is still beautiful, but I would definitely save this one for warmer weather only due to the opening. During those warmer days, though, it is absolutely my favourite fragrance to wear daily. It is rosy, floral, fresh and green. Spring in a bottle.",01/28/23 05:09,AliceRoses
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"The opening is mostly cedar and rose. It's not very sweet although the current note can be detected. Projection is good at first but quickly trails off a few hours in. Reminiscent of a soap or some other product you would pick up at the local farmers market. Over time it loses the soapiness and sour blackcurrant comes to the forefront.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Unique. A very ""green"", grassy scent, with strong currant and cedar. The cedar here almost smells like a mixture of Christmas spices. Simultaneously fresh, woodsy, and fruity. Slightly musky. It is constantly changing and showing different sides of itself.

This is like walking through the woods in early Springtime with a gingersnap in one hand and a cup of fruit juice in the other. There are grasshoppers all around and it recently rained.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Got a free sample of this with another purchase. It does have minor similarity with the original Chloe (emptied a big bottle, when it came out in '08), but then there is a green bitterness about it that I really don't like. Looking at the notes the rose and mimosa are the only 2 I can smell and it is a very odd combination to my nose. It feels like they are putting such a strong emphasis on the 100% natural, vegan etc that the actual scent wasn't as important. Will probably give my sample away.",10/30/22 04:08,Emera1d
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Got a tester of this with a Sephora order and not thinking that I’d like it… I fell in love with the fresh, ozonic dewy rose. It’s perfect for spring and summer, has surprising longevity for a natural fragrance. The neroli is really blended well with the other florals— I do like neroli, but I find it can overtake a fragrance. The rose is definitely the star. The only issue is where to find this in Canada. Every Chloe counter that I visit, the sales reps are not even remotely aware of this scent. Sephora doesn’t carry it, despite giving out the sample. Left scratching my head on this one. I’d buy a FB if I could get my hands on one!

Edit: Dec 2022
Found. FB on Perfumeonline.ca. It’s wonderful, but I won’t be using it much until the spring.

Edit: spring

Perfect for afternoons and mornings. Fresh and breezy. You have to like a green fragrance— I know some people don’t like this accord or find that its presence in a fragrance leaves a cleaning solution vibe. It works for me and I love the dewy freshness. It’s my spring rose scent!",10/22/22 00:06,JennyNoBull
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"My sample says it contains rosa damascena flower oil among other ingredients, like linalool, citral, eugenol etc.
I was looking for the damascena rose smell. Sadly I don't get it. I get an intensely sharp green scent. I only can compare it to the green notes in Sa Majesta La Rose by Lutens. That bushy, thorny aspect of the rose plant that is just...well, not pleasant to my nose.
Sharp, sharp, sharp. Piercingly green.
I thought I was going to love it. I can say it projects like a beast and that is surprising given it's ""naturelle"" condition...

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Wow! This frag really delivers, I was pleasantly surprised this random sample packed quite the punch. I suspect this frag can be quite polarizing on different skin chemistry's / climates. If you like heavier florals it's a must try. To my nose I get watery notes, not ocean water but babbling brook surrounded by moss. The mimosa sparkles through and everything gets a slight sweet edge. Citrus develops and gives this quite the body. I feel like this is what most generic florals miss, and this one nails. Finally The dry-down is sopping wet enormous rose. Quite the treat. I recommend sniffing the trail on this one and judging from there- arm sniffers are going to get smacked in the nose by this one!",09/08/22 06:04,FourFourLoko

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Tested a few of the Chloe rose-centered fragrances and this one was a star. Tangerine rose was great but very much focused on the tangerine, so much so that I'd say it's primarily citrus rather than rose. L' eau had an odd celery note on my skin. Naturelle is a fantastic ROSE. The citrus isn't too bright for this to be multiseasonal, light enough for the summer but woody enough for fall. The rose is deep and peppery-- not too jammy, not too powdery. I wouldn't say this is a FRESH rose, but it is elegant and sensual.",08/28/22 14:21,rainydays

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"The perfume is okay, reminds me of the green Burberry her. The smell however is a bit too strong and long lasting. That would be great if it were notes I enjoyed, however something about it gives clean products and not a clean smell. Clean smell is water, maybe a dove or level 3000 soap. This is cleaning products, as in I can imagine Fabuloso has a smell like this on their line. And it’s as strong as cleaning products too. This fragrance is too heavy for me. I’ll reach for her on days where I’m out all day but not indoors. I can’t smell it for hours on end.",06/26/22 12:38,TiaraJ96

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,I bought this without properly testing it (you'd think I'd learn) because I loved the top notes. Unfortunately the dry down left me disappointed. You know that cheap pink liquid hand soap they have in the bathrooms of less expensive restaurants and in gas stations? That's the drydown.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"I have a little non-spray bottle from the sephora sampler set so I might not be getting the full effect.

It's verrrry citrusy and green...and a little soapy? It reminds me a lot of Daisy Eau So Fresh.

Edit: When I first reviewed I wasn't sure if I liked it, but I wore full a full day last week and it was so nice! It has this uplifting citrusy ""sparkle"" to it that I love, and lasts a surprisingly long time (usually those sparkles can be fleeting). I notice the rose more now that I've worn it for a full day.

I love the original Chloe, but sometimes I worry it's too heavy of a floral for work. I don't feel that with this one. Strongly recommend if you enjoy both the original Chloe and any of the MJ Daisy flankers -- A good potential signature scent if you like those but want something not as many people use.",05/30/22 18:32,spraguelauren
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"I really like the idea of this perfume, the natural aspect, as I hate synthetic smelling scents. I used to wear the OG briefly when it came out, but I really love Chloé l’eau for its green-chypre citrus rose composition. The best one imo.

Naturelle doesn’t top L’eau for me, the mimosa makes it too flowershoppy. It’s not a seductive but more a subtle prim and proper natural woman type of fragrance. I prefer my rose with some patchouli or vanilla. I’d like this as a body product, not as a perfume, but wouldn’t mind smelling this on others.",05/26/22 02:27,Scentedalterego
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"I adore this perfume. It feels bright and carefree and lasts all day on my skin. Many of my favorite perfumes have citrus-rose notes and this scent fits nicely into my collection for when I want to feel optimistic (many of my other scents have more down-to-earth notes). I keep a decanted atomizer in my gym bag and wear it after my morning work out. The top notes hastily exit the scene and I'm left with the rose and neroli for hours.

Honestly, I tested this one before I got to smell the original Chloe EDP. I recognize and appreciate the original Chloe's DNA in Naturelle, but I do think it smells synthetic compared to this lovely, fresh flanker.",05/25/22 08:00,uhtcearebecca
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,I tried Naturelle several times but as much as I can see that.. it does in fact smells natural and real the mimosa ruins it for me totally. I love the Chloe line but this one gets so smoky and unbearable on my skin it is a scrubber. Love the idea behind it and was looking for a fresh rosy green scent and thought this could work but sadly it did not,05/20/22 16:48,auroramaria
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Though it is a lot more expensive than the original edp I will probably get it for summer instead of the original. It is less powdery, less synthetic, a bit greener. Naturelle truly delivers. There is nothing synthetic in the scent. It feels very natural and will not bother anybody. However, as elegant as the rest of the Chloe fragrances. Moreover, it really stands out from all the other summer fragrances - it is truly unique scent. I think it will perform well in the heat and wouldnt probably have much sillage in a winter weather. It takes a lot to get me like a fragrance this much.

Edit: I got myself a small bottle. Oh gosh. It smells like summer field by the cottage I used to go to as a small child. Sunny, natural, comforting, green. It is quite faint scent so I am looking forward to those hotter summer days for using it. It hurts my soul how expensive it is but really - worth every penny.

It is my new favorite. I hope it wont get discontinued. It is amazing 😍",05/14/22 08:16,lesritesdelavie
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Naturally spicy. Unexpected warm spice (almost like cinnamon, but woodier), which I don't see in the listed notes. The Fragrantica review mentions that the type of rose used in this natural formula (de Grasse) has a spicy kick to it, so I think that must be it. This gives the perfume a unique aspect and keeps it fresh. If you can picture how when pink pepper is added to a rose perfume it gives it a cold punch, this spice gives the rose a warm blanket. Nevertheless, this feels fresh and light and I'm loving it for Spring.",05/14/22 05:37,Search and Discover
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"When I was browsing at the store for a summer scent, this one stood out to me more than any of the others. Among all of the florals and gourmand and spicy scents, this is the only one that didn't blur together with all the others. I felt shamed by the clerk because she called it ""granola"" but I guess in a way that's what I was looking for: a scent that smells natural, comfortable, playful and adventurous. It smells like a nice hike.

It's kinda spicy at the beginning. That's the kick of citron. The cedar base is there from the beginning and just gets stronger as it dries down. The heart's rose is not overstated. Blended with the cedar and neroli and mimosa, it almost feels creamy smooth. I work outside a lot so the cedar mixes with my sweat by the end of the day and smells like... I don't know, a healthy sense of adventure.

I've been wearing this for about a month now and it took me a while to get the the point where I appreciate the depth of this scent. I can definitely see myself falling out of love with it if it ever mixes with my BO, I can see myself associating it with being sweaty and dirty.

But for now, this is going to be my summer scent.",05/10/22 20:47,anthirasamsara
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"This Chloe is very green as mentioned by others previously. You have to put this on your skin to see what it will smell like because on paper it is wildly different. When I sprayed this on paper the neroli is very strong and it's pretty much all I can smell, on my skin it's a much nicer/smoother blend. I think that if you like clean fragrances which are not aquatic or citrus dominant, and you enjoy a slight hint of freshly cut grass, you may enjoy this fragrance. It's super inoffensive just like all the Chloes from this line.

P.S. If you're looking for a signature which is unisex and a little different, I would recommend you sample Chloe Nomad EDP - It's more interesting/different than this one, and it's still fresh without being citrus/aquatic dominant.",04/26/22 10:40,LuluBear
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"This smells very, very clean without being aquatic or citrusy. It’s green and soapy. Very feminine. The rose is not overt.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Green and salty, beachy, soft creamy and powdery. Actually not much rose at all, to my nose! But it is very, very lovely, a bit different from the fragrances I have tried before. Feels like something from my childhood - I used to live very close to the beach when I was very little.
Will put this on my wishlist... I have and love Chloe edp (signature), Roses Chloe, Chloe Absolu edp, and the gorgeous beauty Love, Chloe - which I, as many others, hope that they will take back in production!! To me, in this new flanker, there is some resemblance with that soft creamyness that is so special in Love,Chloe. Not the same, of course, but there's just something, to me.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"so i skin tested this and yeah its nice. i AM NOT paying $178 for a 50ml though!.

right so, on skin this is much more unisex than you might think.
retains the dry rosey flroal feel but adds in a green and nice rubber element. I have recently tried something else with mimosa and once you know what it is, its quite recognizable. this is very clean and fresh - almost a laundry smell - which i love, there is a delicate flower peeking out somewhere - but not you usually kind.. maybe a flower and the little bush in which it grows, .. the most delicate rose you might smell walking through a garden centre smelling the bloom attached to the rest of the plant.

clean, fresh, laundry, tiny bit green, delecate (marc jacobs perfect also had this hard to describe nostalgic 'thing' happening). a clean non flowery floral. lasted pretty well",01/05/22 22:57,dglightblue
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Very interesting scent
It has something in common with the rochas Natural scent - girl.
Quitebpretty in the dry down. It has that smooth, yellow floral fresh and rounded thing which Mimosa does

This is a little dry like the original - a dry, laundry, powdery non fresh rose, floral, a tiny bit green but that comes out more for balance overall, it's rounded and cool.
There could almost be a little bit of a rubbery note??
This is overall a clean floral freshie - but no aquatics and no blue feel,no wood either.

I think this is feminine fir sure, however its unisex, there's a delicateness and coolness which could go either way, this isnt rosey per se, nor fruity.

I'm getting very good longevity, I sprayed around 1.30pm and this is still going very well at 8.30pm.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"I didn’t like this one at first, seemed astringent and bitter, but it actually works much better on the skin than on paper. On skin it’s fresh and natural, it glows, I can sense the Chloe DNA; I like what they’ve done with limiting artificial ingredients, very bold move for a designer perfume. I hope this sets off a trend for other perfume houses.

I have worn it to bed and still smelled it the next day. On my clothes it lasts for days. The bright green aspect of the rose reminds me a bit of Mancera Pearl.

I should have known by the note profile, I really don't like neroli and it's quite prominent in this perfume. The green-herby notes combined with the florals and strong citrus give Chloe Naturelle a very vintage quality, which many people may find refreshing in a market dominated by gourmands and fruitchoulis but this scent really isn't for me.",10/11/21 10:08,clairesque
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"This is extremely reminiscent of the original See by Chloe, which was my signature scent in college (and which is now discontinued.) Unfortunately this may be the lightest scent I've ever sprayed, from the Chloe brand or otherwise. No depth, no strength, no sillage. Lasts 15 minutes or fewer. Such a shame, because I love the emphasis on natural ingredients and, like I said, was excited to bring my beloved signature scent back to my collection.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"I really wanted to like this, I'm still really on the fence with it though.

I'm a HUGE fan of Chloe EdP (and formerly the EdT), I loved the L'eau flankers and its one perfume I always gravitate back to time after time because its clean, its fresh, it works well with my chemistry and it really suits me well, so I got quite excited when I saw that Chloe was releasing this, I was hoping it may be a bit of a nod to the L'eau flankers with some extra fruity facets added to it.
As soon as I knew it was in stores I ventured out to my closest department store to try it, the first sniff from the sprayer was interesting; very strong blackcurrant/blackcurrant bud which read a little bit urine like to my nose but I decided to try it on my skin. The blackcurrant was present and quite strong but thankfully it settled a little bit to make way for the citron and then after 20 minutes the signature powdery/woody Chloe rose comes out and I thought it was quite pleasant, until, however 2 hours in when I noticed this ""room freshener/pledge"" type note coming from my wrist, (No, I am not a city dweller nor am I detached from nature, I also grow roses) and I have to say it kind of ruined it for me, I could still detect the gorgeousness from the other notes but whatever it is in the composition just didnt work well with my skin and that is such a shame!

I can totally see this working well on other people and I am really jealous of those whos skin really works well with the notes and allows this perfume to really bloom and flourish. I'm yet to be defeated though, I will be trying this again to see if I can get it to work for me because I really really wanted this to work for me like the original and L'eau flankers :(",09/30/21 06:40,GinCatsBooks
Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Gives romantic vibes like other Chloe signatures. This is a very fresh scent, green and not sweet, there is blackcurrant buds, not the berries itself (wrong on this page) . I like the combination of mimosa, citron and rose with slight woody hints, like Mediterranean spring in a bottle…actually how odd to introduce this in fall. But I think many will be fans of this. It makes one feel refreshed and in tune with nature..
I like its sharp contrast against all artificial and sweet scents of today, this is like from another era.. so romantic 🍋🥀

Upon spraying, my nose is hit with a sharp bitterness that mellows after around 10 minutes. Even though I like the interplay of rose and mimosa in this EDP Naturelle, the whole fragrance is a bit too sharp, bitter and dry for me. I perceive the sillage to be strong, which I also attribute to the sharpness. I suggest to those who love the original EDP and who like drier fragrances to also test this one because they have definitely the same DNA.",09/20/21 13:31,KöbiD

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Being someone that dislikes (some) synthetics, I am always quite happy to try natural perfume as no chance of encountering them. Not sure what 100% natural means here, but it did not scratch me in that way and it smells quite natural.

Definitely a mimosa perfume, at least that’s what I smell more clearly, and the rose is the May kind of rose, fresh and lemony so blends in with the lemon. I really like mimosa, so quite happy with it. It is a soft innocent type of scent but does not disappear in 2 hours- I can still smell where I sprayed this on my arm quite clearly 3-4 hours later. It reminds me a bit of Iris Perle from Les Indemodables. In that one the clary sage gives spark to the mimosa, and here the cassis and lemon do the same. Nice. First impression is I like it.

Edit: I have bought this perfume and have really been enjoying wearing it. My initial impression remains, and I find the longevity good around 8+ hours, but mild projection at my usual 1-2 sprays (for me that’s a positive, but I am aware this may not be the case for everyone). It’s an easy reach.

For reference, the other two Chloes I like are L’Eau de Chloe and Love Chloe, both now discontinued. I don’t really like the Chloe EDP as I now find it too synthetic strong and a bit headache inducing. However I used to own a bottle years ago given to me as a present. I wasn’t into fragrance then and didn’t realise it had caused olfactory fatigue so I maybe used 3-4 sprays at times and was very surprised when my boss very strongly complained about it 2 metres away from me and I couldn’t smell it! Avoidance of olfactory fatigue, that is a nice excuse for owning multiple perfumes to keep in rotation :)",09/15/21 13:50,Cicely81

Chloé Eau de Parfum Naturelle Chloé,"Not what I expected! Don't be fooled by the green ribbon, this isn't a fresh fragrance - instead it's quite sweet. Looking at the notes, I imagined a summer neroli surrounded by lemons, with cedar at the base. What I got was far from it - opens with mimosa, comforting and really well done. Citron is detectable from the start, but you can only appreciate it a few minutes in. It's juicy and lemony, complementing the sweetness of mimosa. I get the Chloe DNA in this one, and even though the notes are completely different, I sometimes get whiffs of the original See by Chloe. A pleasant blind buy.",09/09/21 02:04,DiscoPolga
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"As I am wearing this today on an autumn day I felt the need to share my story on this one. I got this bottle, which is almost empty, just before COVID on sale at Corte Ingles, 40 for 50ml bottle. I never owned any Chloe fragrance, and never bought any after, but this was love at first smell. It's beautiful! Sure not going to say anything that has not already has been said. It makes you feel clean, feminine, classy, calm. Love wearing this at night after shower, but this definitely can be worn just as much with a nice dress for a night out.

I got this together with a bottle of eau Florale. Both are beauties on their own. After wearing it for a few days I discovered how much sought after this is and sadly discontinued, so I called the Cort Ingles, telling them to save the left over bottles as I needed a backup!!

Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Intense is one of the last so called modern fragnances that I like, use and want to stay.
If I must find one word to describe it it's a word elegance. This is epitome of elegancy. It calls for elegant women. No, this is not scent a person can camouflage by ""it's modern I am not spirituality elegant but I can wear it."" It doesn't work. This is coat that fits born elegance. This scent is in its essence elegant. Smells elegant, allures elegance and it enhances spiritually elegant woman. Imagine Grace Kelly wearing it. It is possible to imagine that. Now try to imagine Natalie Portman wearing this. It doesn't work. That's what this perfume is. It's caractéristique expensive, luxurious, clean, attractive, powdery, irritating, intelligent and decent. This is not sexy or vulgare perfume. This is scent that doesn't wear mini skirts or tennis shoes. It wears long gloves and pearls. In its composition it is mature. I wore Intense when I meet my future husband. He memorised it forever.

Top notes:
Iris, Heliotrope, pink pepper (I can detect it)
Heart Notes:
Hyacinth, Lilac, Wisteria, wood (I can't define, maybe it's artificial)
Base Notes:
Talcum, Peru Balsam, Vanilla, Musk, rice powder (musk gave a bit of a sweaty sensation... So nice).

Looks simple. But the dosage and mixture is controlled. It opens nice. It settles nice. It dries down nice. It's very beautiful perfume. Great quality.

Bottle is elegant. In whole. With that wonderful chain attached to cover. Simply elegant. Beautiful.

Love Eau Intense Chloé,"I haven't worn this scent for more than 9 years! But back then, when I discovered this line in the shops and the world was all fruity floral and fruitchouli, I was so smitten, that I bought the regular EdP, its bodylotion and two large bottles of the Intense version - crazy. I stopped wearing it because my three pregnancies caused quite an olfactoric stir... Back than and now my DH thinks it smells like vintage 70tie or 80ties hairspray and I agree with this when it comes to the frist 15 minutes. The beginning is a bit chalky (the Iris?) and - dare I say - suffocating (Heliotrope?). In the regular EdP version I perceive this effect even more pronounced. But after some 15 minutes later it morphes into a beigey, addictive, powdery, floral, makeup-y veil, that is very sexy in an non offensive, je ne sais quoi kind of way. This is, what I imagined Chanel's ""Beige"" to be.
On my rather dry skin it has moderate lasting power (I applied this morning, 4 hours ago) and I still get whiffs of it, but it is slowly turning into a skin scent. I prefer the Intense version because the Vanilla is amped up here and makes the scent a bit snugglyer and less perfumey than the regular EdP, also definitively suited for colder months. I cannot imagine this version in summer, frankly not even the regular one. Its projection is discrete-moderate (wearing 4 sprays today) and I find it perfect for office too.This Love,Chloé line is a gift from women to women. It is the sort of scent, that women comment and compliment, but I don't see guys being attracted to it, seduced by it or even notice it. It is too restraint for that. But I get compliments from my six year old son ;-)
After wearing it several days in a row I have the following feeling about it: Imagine yourself preparing for a party. Your skin is perfect, the hair shiny and healthy and your dress has a minimalistic cut in an expensive heavy nude silk. You feel so feminine and classy. But then you arrive at the party and there is lots of bright colors, ruffles, drapes, complicated hair-does and red lipsticks. And although beautyful you just don't get noticed. I think this was the problem with Love, Chloé, when it was lunched. It should have been more amplified, more exagerated (like the Narciso Poudrée) to exist next to Mademoiselle and Her. Neither in the commercial nor in the print add the model is really seeking eyecontact with the spectator. So why should we watch her?",11/17/22 01:39,Mme Bovary
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"I’m down to my last fews sprays of this. Maybe one more wearing. I’m going to MISS THIS SO MUCH. Love, Chloe & Love, Chloe eau Intense were the closest things to signature scents for me from about 2012-2016. Something about these powdery florals that just suited me perfectly. Projection & sillage were moderate too. Such an absolute shame they’re gone. GORGEOUS.",10/22/22 11:34,perfumesniffer
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"I do love this intense version of Love, but the original (my signature of 5+ years) suits my chemistry and lifestyle better. Though gorgeous, this one smells very formal to my nose, like something you’d wear to a black-tie event, not an everyday/signature scent. It’s the original Chloe but minus the bright opening of neroli + pink pepper, and oomphed up in the base with vanilla and balsam, giving the scent more weight and body, and abit more sweetness and warmth. It’s still powdery, but not as powdery clean or as radiant as the original, rather it’s dense and richer. Monstrous sillage, but in a beautiful way. Very classy, fit for a princess.",09/11/22 13:30,marialena888m
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Someone long ago mentioned here that it’s reminiscent of Guerlain works. Hmmm…plausible but not entirely. Love Intense fails to make natural its signature Chloe base; to me this still smells synthetic like in Ricci’s Deci Dela: a sharp rose and musk combo. However, the use of royal colored flowers is outstanding, giving it a ruminant feel. I also find it shares the watery quality as with some of Guerlain’s high-browed offerings which despite listing notes of intense nature (vanilla, benzoin etc.), one gets a restrained accord. Both beautiful nonetheless.

Opening is juicy and fruity; I’m wondering why rose isn’t declared as note. Then quickly to the heart of purple florals and vanilla. It leans slightly gourmand and may make one remember violet candies. On to its drydown, a lighthearted vanilla and musk with vestiges of the color purple.

Pleasant and well-rounded.",06/15/22 02:46,jung_yunho26
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"If violet was a color, it’d be this perfume 💜.
Chloe Love Intense is a powdery floral based scent with prominent notes of Iris, hyacinth and vanilla. The iris makes it powdery and the vanilla, somehow sweet. You’ll love this if you want something classy, inviting and confident.
Because this is good and has been discontinued, it’s being ridiculously overpriced.",05/02/22 05:56,pweedyadel
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Love Chloé Intense is my personal iris beauty.

I have smelled quite a few irises and there are really very beautiful current fragrances and also more vintage, designer and niche ones. But Love Chloé I is my talisman. The mixture of iris, vanilla and lilac are unique.

It is a perfume that does not evolve much in its smell, but it is not boring. It has a masterful sweetness, it's like an icy sweetness, cold and even dark.
I love feeling its beauty emulating a vintage scent but based on a perfect modern Chloé perfume.

I admit that no Chloé is my passion, but this perfume is from another galaxy.
Their bohemian romanticism makes me go crazy, I haven't found anything that is close enough, sometimes they have too much heliotrope and poorly conjugated and instead in this icy work of art everything is measured. And when I say measured I don't mean lazy or bland, it's not simple or cheesy.

Really Love Chloé I needs to be used when you feel within you that true beauty of vintage boudoir perfumes, but they must be the true vintage ones...

If you find it and it fits you, you will be able to enjoy long hours of this beautiful iridescent pearl and you will surely see that they want to hug you... because it is a fragrance of hugs, kisses, tenderness...
It is one of the few perfumes that make me feel really hyper feminine",01/16/22 01:04,LOST_HORIZON
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Amazing purple flower dream of a perfume, I have both the Love, Chloe EDP and Love, Chloe Intense versions. Both are lovely in their own right and in different weather. Intense seems to cover a slightly wider temperature range for me. Sad that this beauty has been discontinued, really happy I bought a backup when I originally got this.

This forms a wonderful powdery purple cloud around me, it feels softer and more comforting that the EDP. The vanilla doesn't seem to be as pronounced on me as it seems to be with others but is probably what provides the softness and gentler touch.

Love Eau Intense Chloé,"I wore Love, Chloe edp as my signature for about 4-5 years. That stuff was AMAZING. Like, literally perfect. I was late to finding out about the Intense version and have only had 1 bottle. The Intense version is all the perfect fluffy sophistication of the original except with a more dense quality and a big dollop of vanilla in the dry down. The Intense is not gourmand, it just hints at the edges of that territory. I can honestly say that Love, Chloe edp and Love, Chloe Intense are the best mainstream releases of the 2010s, hands down. I would describe them as if Guerlainade was recreated for a mainstream brand. Very retro inspired, but cheeky, playful modern scents for adult women. The Intense is a bit more sexy. I’m nearing the end of my bottle and starting to eye the $250 bottles on eBay. A ridiculous travesty that these were discontinued. 10/10 Sublime

Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Just purchased a decant sample on Ebay of Love Chloe Intense & Love Chloe Florale. I love both however Love Chloe EDP will be my forever fave.

It smells like they isolated the powdery fluffy part of the original. Sprayed on my left hand it was so strong and my right hand very subtle skin scent. On my clothes wow it's a whole new scent! It's beautiful.

The whole Bottle is going for around $200 so my little sample is perfect. I want to wear a sweater and smell like this puffy cloud in the winter. So if you want Love Chloe without the Orange Blossom and Pepper this is for you.",04/20/21 19:43,Jaxie23
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"It smells extremely intense in the first 30 mins of wear to the point where I cannot tolerate it at times. But the dry down is absolutely gorgeous and so powdery. I never spray it directly on myself, I would spray it in my closet or on my clothes an hour before wearing them. The lasting power is really good, I get almost 7 to 8 hours.",04/10/21 07:04,tryhardcomplex
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"It literally smells like wearing you favourite cashmere jumper. After 30 min I get a subtly soapy, deep iris, heliotrophe, hyacint, vanilla as well as some very round and soft woodsy and balsamic notes. Also recall smelling something almondy or nutty after another 30 minutes. There's some nostalgia vibes going on with this one. It makes me think of a European city on a late summer afternoon, brick and concrete warm from the sunlight, and a flowershop about to close for the day.",03/25/21 21:17,nadja___sofia

Love Eau Intense Chloé,"I got it from ebay. Very expensive this days. It is powdery, flowery, sweet. I don't regret buying it but wont buy it again. There are other scents with similar floweriness, it just reminds me of volupte by Oscar de la Renta, which is easy to find and very unexpensive, not the same scent by any means, but a very similar vibe, similar flowery/intense olfactory experience.",08/20/20 18:09,aspirina
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"I bought this about 2 years ago reasonably priced on the grey market and stored it away, only discovering it last night as I sift through my collection to list items for sale.
I decided to open and having tested it I chose to keep this one. It’s very intense in a sweet but not cloying way. I am not being overwhelmed by violets or purple flowers, and I am pretty sure this is very similar to Angel’s Dust by Francesca Bianchi.
I can see Chloe Love and Chloe Love intense are both now ridiculously priced on eBay as they’ve been discontinued. If you love this and must have it without the stupid price tag, try to get a sample of Angel’s Dust and see if it satisfies your obsession. Angel dust is also offered as extrait so you’re going to get more bang for your buck.
My opinion only, hope it is helpful.",06/26/20 21:26,Annabear
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Wow, I can't believe this is going for so much these days! I found my bottle at a discounter last summer and snatched it up! It was a blind buy. I spritzed it 3 times on myself and almost immediately began to regret it. There's something a little too sharp that was poking through and making me feel nauseated. I decided to try it again today with just ONE spray (since I was just wanting to re-test) and I'm happy to report that I like it much better. This is really a powdery explosion of purple flowers, just like in the pyramid. I love iris and heliotrope, but I'm not as familiar with how the other flowers are supposed to smell. The vanilla really saves this, and I'm thinking that if I'm actually going to wear this, I need to layer on another vanilla just to keep it more balanced. Overall, this is a pretty makeup-y smell. If it had some oud it would be stellar. I may try layering on some Nemat Arabian Wood oil to see if it transforms it.",05/14/20 19:53,mychinarose
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"I usually have decent luck with ""blind buys"", not this time! I remember testing the original Love Chloe years ago and really liking it. After reading reviews for this one and the original I was second guessing which one I'd tested and liked and guessed that it must have been the ""Intense"" version. Unfortunately it wasn't and I hate this one so much that I had to come home and change my clothes because I couldn't take it one minute longer. There are only a few other fragrances that I feel this way about - Amarige, Cabotine, Eternity and White Linen. Amarige always makes me feel slightly queasy and this one did the same and besides musk they don't seem to share other notes so I'm not sure what it is but I will be getting rid of this asap as I can't risk my daughter taking a liking to it!",05/22/19 21:41,Jeannine520
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"LOVE this perfume! I feel like ""me"" when I wear it. I love the original Love Chloe (as well as the eau florale)but there is something special about the Intense version.

Longevity is great and the bottle is one of my very favorites.",03/04/19 10:16,elmccullar
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"what a magical perfume. i had been so curious about the original ""love, chloe"" after katie puckrick described it as such a unique designer offering. i see why, now - purple flower fragrances aren't so common these days, although this one is astonishingly beautiful.

when i first sprayed this on, it took me back to summers in bangladesh. after a shower, quickly getting dressed in someone else's bedroom, hoping no one wandered in because the doors always had pants hanging over the top and thus wouldn't close all the way. then furtively grabbing someone else's powder bottle, trying to shake some down your top, but nothing comes out. shake the bottle, tap it again, and whoosh now you're covered in powder, your whole neck and dress are dusty white but you almost don't care because of the scent...the cloud of fresh sweetness that coats your skin in flour, separating you from your slightly damp clothing. you already feel like a lady. you can hear all the traffic and sellers outside beneath the balcony and you are upstairs, your hair poorly wrapped in a towel, your clothes a speckled mess, but in your vision a queen because you smell and feel like one. you don't need perfume, deodorant, anything with this powder - it smells beautiful and fresh all over. ""love, chloe eau intense"" reminds me of that powder.

this beautiful iris vanilla fragrance is golden in quality, classy enough to make you feel a true lady even in pajamas (my current state.) there is a bitterness here, in the back of the throat when you inhale that keeps it earthy, like powder molecules scratching your airways. is heliotrope bitter? maybe that's what i'm smelling.

this is a warm iris fragrance, not a cold one. a shimmering lavender gold fabric, flashing royal purple in the light. i dabbed this on from the last of my sample, and it feels like this perfume was meant to be applied that way - the peru balsam gives it a vintage, heavy feel.

it's a crying shame this was discontinued. how i wish more women smelled like this...warm, inviting, but also aloof, not like a cake to eat...",02/11/19 07:57,ntabassum92
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"This is amazingly beautiful scent. Indeed, Love Intense is like the softest, the most luxurious cashmere sweater. It's super, super elegant and classy. This is the scent of confident, caring, warm and gentle woman. Perfect for fall and winter season.

Chloe Love Intense is really powdery,you can definitely smell heliotrope and iris, with a hint of luxurious, melted pralines and chocolate. It's sweeter than the first Chloe Love and I like it more than her older sister.

It was a blind buy for me. Unfortunately it turns out, that on my skin it was not what I expected. On my skin Love Intense smells too powdery and too sharp. I can't smell those yummy chocolate pralines, nothing sweet on me. I didn't feel good in these one, so I gave it to my mum and on her skin it smells A-MAZ-ING. Pure magic.

It is really sad, that Love sisters was discontinued.",10/10/18 01:38,Wero94

Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Winter beauty.Iris so powdery and delicate on a vanilla cloud, makes you smile during some snowy mornings, like you sit on the sofa in a fluffy sweater and warm socks holding a cappuccino cup.Heliotrope gives some elegance and sensitivity, underlines an inner rather than outer beauty of a person wearing it.All is silent and white with silver and violet tones.We don`t need to speak up.Love Intense -as there is nothing intense in it-is an oriental perfume with some depth.Musky tones with violet flowers including the most difficult note of lilac embrace you like friendly arms do.It`a scent of missing our closest, for waiting,for some conversations we might have had but which for some reason never happened.
Quite different from other,rosey Chloe products Love Intense is a long-lasting scent, especially natural fabrics hold it for days.Not a skin scent with average sillage. For winter time rather as it looses part of its beauty in a hot weather

Love Eau Intense Chloé,"I am a big lover of Love EDP. But the first thing that comes to mind with this one is: winter. The powdery notes are definitely (!!!) more accentuated, and the woody ones are subtle to smell. I think this one is more appropriate for winterly usage, at night, because its sillage is very heavy. Some people might get nauseated, I'ver heard. But I would never trade my Love EDP for this one, I have it, and I use it for specific occasions during winter..to me it matches with a fireplace, red wine, friends... people that appreciate the powdery notes of the first one will definitely enjoy this-if they can find one.

sweeter sister of Chloe Love",08/07/16 18:34,relaxx1
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Love Intense is quite an intriguing creation. The original Love is one of the better designer scents released the past decade. An effervescent and easy going fragrance, composed of purple flowers and an elegant, powdery backbone. It is quite a shame that, along with its flankers, Love is discontinued. Even though I like the original a lot and would actually wear it, despite it's uber feminine status; it's the equivalent of wearing a hyacinth mascot costume which shouts ""Look at me!', simply because of it's nuclear longevity and sillage - it's too much for me personally.
I'd rather much wear the Intense flanker. It dials down on the sillage and soapy flowers, and replaces them with vanilla, tolu balsam and musk.
The opening actually reminds me of Licor 43; I guess it's the iris and heliotrope combined with the vanilla. It's powdery, floral but also balsamic - it also has a nutty, almondy feeling, provided by the heliotrope. The vanilla in Intense is more of the vanilla extract kind, that gooey, brown liquid you would add to your cakes. It's dark, sweet but it also has a bitter facet.
After the booze-like opening fades, a swooning trio of purple flowers shows up, with lilac being the most noticeable. It's not as hyper floral as in the original Love. I can also sense a bit of hyacinth, but the lilac is most prominent to me. It merges beautifully with the opening, balancing floral notes with powdery ones. It is never too sweet or overpowering, though.
The drydown is the best part of the fragrance. The florals start to fade and the musk appears. It gives Intense it's fluffy and clean character, whereas the vanilla and tolu balsam increase the balsamic aspect of Intense. The end result is a powdery floral, resting on a cloud of musk and dark vanilla with leathery aspects.
Longevity is good, around 6-8 hours for me. Sillage is considerably lighter when compared to the original Love (which is a good thing for me). It hovers around me for a good 4 hours, before turning into a skin scent.
Somehow it actually reminds me of Gucci EdP, launched in 2002. It has that same sensual vanilla and floral combination. The Gucci is a lot more subdued, spicy and leathery though. You could consider Intense to be it's more upbeat, daytime sister; being more floral and clean. Love Intense is a really good fragrance, and I'd advise you to pick it up before it completely disappears and prices will skyrocket for this little gem.",12/08/15 10:56,deda147
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Overall this is very nice. If you like the original Love, then you will enjoy this Intense version. It's still purple/flowery just the starchy rice note is replaced by vanilla. The vanilla hits hard in the beginning, and it strikes me a little synthetic/plasticy. Its not a warm creamy vanilla, but a cool distant almost powdery one. It dries down pretty quickly, then it becomes the purple/powdery Love that one would expect. It defiantly has more punch than the original, more of a body, a backbone. Less light and clean, and more flowery and pronounced. Don't be afraid to blind buy this one as its discontinued and prices are reasonable on the secondary market. Once its gone this one might be valuable. It's a quality, well made fragrance. Thumbs way up.",11/04/15 19:07,Vegas Pauli
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Mi piacciono tanto tutti i Love di Chloè: il classico per la stagione fredda e l'eau florale per la primavera/estate (ma entrambi sono fantastici sempre). Anche questo Love eau intense è speciale, ma per un altro motivo: non amo indossarlo, ma per me rappresenta un piccolo viaggio olfattivo e mi piace ogni tanto farmi spruzzare una mouillette in profumeria e tenermela in borsa per sentire l'evoluzione di questo profumo. Si apre con una forte vaniglia molto femminile, per niente secca ma umida e balsamica, quasi liquorosa. Quindi si assesta su qualcosa che mi riporta a quando ero bambina in spiaggia: un meraviglioso profumo ""caldo ma fresco"", molto naturale ma ricercato, evidentemente simile a qualche crema abbronzante sentita molti anni fa :)
Poi subentra una fase talcata molto simile al Love classico, ma un po' più aromatica, e infine percepisco una scia che mi ricorda un connubio fra My name di Trussardi e Legni fruttati Erbolario... strano ma vero! Comunque delizioso.",11/03/15 01:52,emi.fra
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"This is a really nice one! I love the original Love, Chloe EDP too and you can tell these are sisters.

I honestly like the opening of Eau Intense better because it lacks the sharp-ish pink pepper and the hyacinth is much more subdued. Then I get all the melange of purple flowers and powder which is what they mostly have in common with Love,Chloe.

The drydown goes to an entirely different direction though. Still retains some of the powderyness but gets more balmy, creamy/ambery instead of creamy/starchy here.

I like the drydown of this one a bit less than Love, Chloe and if anything it's not as intense despite the name. Still, I enjoy it a lot and wouldn't mind a bottle sometime.",10/02/15 06:29,MoreScentsThanSense
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"I recently purchased Love, Chloe eau Intense. I own and love other Chloe perfumes such as Chloe Chloe EDP, Chloe l'eau Chloe. Chloe EDP and L'eau Chloe are rose centered. Love, Chloe eau Intense in my opinion is a spicy floral. I wore it today for the first extended period of time and I am happy! I have been looking for a signature and this may be it. I sprayed about 5 healthy sprays total....one on each wrist, behind each ear and one spray on my decollatage. At first to me it seemed a bit over-powering but as I was leaving for work my husband commented twice on how good I smelled. Hmm...that's a good sign. My hubby usually doesn't tell me that unless I have some sickly sweet gourmand like Britney Spears Midnight Fantasy on, which I keep around just for him. I kept getting wafts of this perfume for about 8-9 hours at work. Again, a little overwhelming at first then spicy, almost Big Red gum, in the middle with lovely sweet spice and then dried purple flowers with a hint of sweetness for the dry down. Hopefully I have described it correctly, in my humble opinion anyway. I really like it so far....",09/21/15 17:10,AliPratt25
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"I purchased a 1oz bottle in high summer and found it rather too powerful. Six months later, in cold and rainy weather Love Chloe Intense is in its element (s)

It's rich and aristocratic, a bit highbrow and it doesn't know how to have fun; Love Chloe Intense takes itself very seriously, it's uptight and thorough, …..Man, is she Intense. Definitely a hard working lawyer type with winning on her mind. It's a very very good perfume, nicely crafted, I think the materials are the upper end of the commercial scale. That's my opinion.

The cherry pie of heliotrope is strong. I can't wear this perfume early in the day and I certainly wouldn't refresh it in a confined space or a dining area, but if I was in an art gallery, looking at jewellery, at a sophisticated wine bar or better yet, in a convertible, Love Chloe Intense would be part of my projecting persona.

Love Eau Intense Chloé,"I bought this blind as I was fairly sure I would like it, being a massive iris fan. Dry, distinctly iris based, powdery, purple flowers and a musky vanilla dry-down. Like Guermantes review, I also immediately picked up the association to L'Heure Bleu - must be the heliotrope that gives the slightly oily, waxy smell at the opening. I'm not a great fan of this part, but it is fleeting and soon dries down to that powdery floral vanilla. The lilac is quite prominent too and I get a similarity to Guerlains Champs Elysees due to this. Very nice - great scent for the office as long as not sprayed too heavily, makes you feel fresh and lovely.",08/04/15 21:38,twoteacakes
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"The comparison between Love Chloe and Love Eau Intense Chloe.

I am wearing two testers on my wrists today. They both are lovely, warm, comforting and very feminine. I'd say, Love is a bit greener and Love Intense is a touch sweeter and more intense, as the name suggests. I think I would prefer Love Eau Intense as it has beautiful vanilla in and the heliotrope here is more pronounced. These two notes, I suppose, give the Love Eau Intense some intriguing and retro aura. Retro being said in a very good way, not 'old woman' at all. I would say, Love Eau Intense is better for the evening wear while Love would do for the office.

UPD: Projection is moderate and the longevity is about 2-3 hours on me with Love and about 6 hours with Love Eau Intense, should be staying longer on clothes. Both fragrances are very cosy and warm so should be just great for autumn and winter. To me Love Eau Intense is definitely the winner between the two. Might go for the full bottle",06/13/15 05:33,oks-oks
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"More powdery than I expected but I like this a lot. Powdery iris, sweet vanilla and heliotrope all tied up in a lacy, musky sachet of girliness. Nice longevity, I think the sillage is excellent without being overwhelming. This shows the world the sweet feminine side that comes out in us all every once in a while. It is gracious sweetness in a bottle.

As a huuuuuuuge fan of the original Love, Chloe, I was disappointed in the Intense. It sounded like it would be close to my dream fragrance, buuuut, not so much, it turns out.

Love Intense begins with a minty, powdery, chemical-feeling vanilla. You can smell the original Love in the background ever so slightly, but it has this veil of weird vanilla over the top of it.

It's certainly not as strong with my chemistry as everyone is claiming, either! I have to really press my nose to my skin to get a good sniff.

So on all fronts, this version is a no-go for me :(.",11/06/14 23:34,Bloodlust
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Ι would't say this one is more intense. It is certainly more powdery and has more vanilla, whereas the original to my nose is more floral and the pepper is really pronounced. But, to me, the original love has more sillage and longevity. Those WHO love the original, will love this one too, but if you are looking for a more robust , nigh time , wintery version, I don' think this is the one. I like to combine the two of them, for the longevity and the powderness. Love intense is very alike to chanel nr5, a modern version of it.

Love Eau Intense Chloé,"It's funny that despite Chloe Love Intense's scent pyramid this really does not register as either purple or floral to me at all.

Instead it feels like I'm sipping a very warm vanilla liquour served next to a lady who is powdering her entire body. This lady might have spritzed on some Chloe Love in the morning, but the powder and the vanilla aromas surrounding me overwhelm it.

I think this would be a lovely scent during colder weather, fantastic for snuggling up to someone in front of the fire while wearing an ivory cashmir sweater.

Personally, I don't find myself reaching for scents that are this powdery very often, and since I slightly prefer my Flower by Kenzo Le Parfum over Chloe Love Intense I think this one might end up in someone else's wardrobe in the future. Still, though, this is the 'warmest' Chloe perfume I know, and I would not mind being stuck in a small room with someone who wears this :D",05/06/14 07:44,jessbug
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Chloé Love Eau Intense preserves the powdery iris in the original Love, Chloé. And it's not necessarily much stronger, but instead, deeper and warmer due to promient vanilla and heliotrope, and even appears a bit milky. It's sweeter, but just slightly. It's cozy and fluffy, and if compared side by side, its warmth makes the original Love, Chloé seem cooler and more mineral, even edgier than how I perceived it before.

This tender warmth provided by vanilla and heliotrope leaves after about 5 hours. And at this moment, the drydowns of Eau Intense and Love, Chloé don't seem to differ a lot. However, after about 6 hours, a mineral and slightly salty amber kicks in, bringing in another depth and warmth to the drydown.

The sillage of Love Eau Intense is moderate on me, and the longevity is around 10 hours. Although Love Eau Intense is no doubt very powdery, it's not aggressive, and the sweetness of vanilla is also well balanced so that it doesn't get annoying. I highly recommend it to those who are looking for a vanilla floral fragrance and adores powdery texture.",04/22/14 11:55,StellaDiverFlynn
Love Eau Intense Chloé,It smells like someone put a little bit of caramel in the original Love. It's sweeter. Does anyone know if it was discontinued? It's hard to find even online.,03/25/14 09:46,Agatha-Christie
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"I was out of the original Love, so I decided to give the Intense a try. I was hoping it would smell exactly like the original (only stronger), but the Intense has a prominent powdery note which out shines the lilac and iris. I might still prefer the original's flowery notes over this one. The Intense is a very nice fragrance by itself, but I think layering the two would be amazing! If you were wondering if you need both the Love Chloe and Love Chloe Eau Intense in your collection, I say go for it!",01/23/14 08:58,allaboutbeauty
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"The original Love is my signature, and this is just glorious. A stronger, sweeter, much more opulent and 'dressier' version, Love Intense smells like bottled gold. Whereas the original has a stylishly clean sort of shampoo-vibe, this one feels more voluptuous and decadent...but they are very similar otherwise. At the core, both are basically the same sophisticated lilac rich floral with a very powdery start, morphing into something clean, feminine, sensuous and balmy. It's very potent so just a few spritzes will do. This is the sort of scent I would wear when I want to feel rich, glamorous, intelligent, sensual and drenched in luxury. I immediately feel like an 'ultimate' version of me, and I can almost hear myself speaking 6 different languages, wearing diamonds, and 20,000 dollar gowns on my perfectly sleek and flawless figure. I would wear it for fancy evening outings, or to an upscale jazz lounge with my littlest LBD and red lips. It wouldn't really smell out of place even if you chose to wear it daily, just as long as you're dressed for it, it needs a good pair of heels, perfect hair and abit of lipstick at the very least...absolutely no track pants, t-shirts or saggy blue jeans, no! This is the scent that lifts my spirits and makes me want to go out there and grab myself a large hunk of life, and do it with every single ounce of style, sophistication, sensuality and wit that I can squeeze out of me. Because of that, I definitely prefer to save Love Intense for special occasions or when I need that emotional boost, it is not an everyday scent for me, that is why the original remains as my signature.

Scent breakdown, from 1st spritz:
30 seconds: Hmm...this smells like something I could fall in love with!
10-20 minutes: Oh no!! it settled down to talcum powder! Nothing but a ton of talcum powder!!! AA-Choo!!!
30-40 minutes: the annoying talcum powder is fading away, and a rich opulent gorgeous feminine scent is emerging...mmmm...
1 hour: Okay this is amazing! I LOVE it. LOVE. Just like the original Love, I'm willing to endure the first 30 minutes of yucky powder to get to this!
3 hours: That same gorgeous scent is still wafting around me, and it's getting abit sweeter, warmer and fuzzier...sooo good....
5 hours: It's still there, not even fading yet :)
7 hours: On my skin the scent is soft by now, but still going strong on fabric.
12 hours: Close to the skin, a soft clean scent...still very detectable on fabric even though it's not leaving a trail like the first 7-8 hours.
update
20 hours: As I was waking up from my sleep, I caught this scent on my wrist, what a beautiful scent to wake up to :) It's still there, soft as an angel's breath, but there.

Tip: The application method that works best for me is 2 to 3 large squirts on fabric (usually the front of my blouse for eg.), and 1 large squirt distributed between both my wrists and neck. If you dislike the 'powdery' start (though it does fade away completely, some days it can be a bother to me), then I suggest you concentrate spraying it on fabric and the back of the neck (just beneath your hair), this is a scent that develops absolutely stunningly on fabric, it cocoons me in its clean, soft golden haze of a scent and leaves the most gorgeous trail.",01/12/14 22:09,CozyCat
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"I just tried it today at the mall. I am impressed with it's longivety. Smell itself is also beautiful, very purple & flowery with a hint of powdery. I disagree that vanilla is dominant note (according to the votes by readers above). It goes along very well with my skin chemistry.",12/29/13 14:20,mirisfrik
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"After reading the recent and positive reviews, I sampled this perfume. I was quite disappointed, because of the chemical quality of ingredients I smelt on my skin.

I love very strong perfumes which is normally my signature. However, this perfume smells of heavy alcohol. The amber is very overpowering and rather crass. When I smelt my wrist after 1 spray it was floral. But it had a bitter smell. One ingredient that made me feel sick when I smelt my skin. However, when I walked around the perfume trail was pleasant and lovely with a floral musky smell.

This retro styled perfume has a slightly sharp burnt caramel smell, with a leather and old stale pot pouri favours after 2 hours. Interestingly, I have original retro perfumes which are musky, smooth, elegant, nicely balanced and very long lasting. For example, I have the original Armani perfume made in 1982. But this perfume has a jarring factor on me or perhaps it is a too try hard ""look at me"" factor when I wear it.

This perfume is too intense, and overdone for me. It is a long lasting perfume, which I sampled the perfume stays close to the skin after 1 hour. But then I lost the impressive perfume trail.

The perfume is extremely overpriced. I like the Chloe Love EDP much better. It is more balsamic, powdery, floral, musky, chic and lasted after 8 hours closely on the skin. The Chloe Love EDP perfume is sublime, delicious and nicely done. Sometimes less is more.

The Intense perfume has a strong alcoholic smell after 5 hours is unpleasant. For me, it was not value for money. It reminds me of a very strong Guilty from Gucci, the original rectangular brown bottle. There is a plastic and chemical smell with this perfume, and is off putting for me, even now. I will not purchase this perfume. I recommend that you will need to first sample this perfume, unless you like strong, musky and alcohol smelling perfumes.",12/06/13 23:37,aber19
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Old perfumed talc you found in the attic is how it smells like. Marginally better than Love, Chloe, but still bitter, powdery and strong. It's a somewhat pleasant smell - it has that charming retro vibe of your grandma's vanity table, but it's very loud even in cold weather, and you fill the room with suffocating powdery bitterness when you wear it. There's no air around you, only that powdery cloud. I quite liked it on, especially after a couple of hours, but it gives my husband a headache. Heliotrope, iris, vanilla & peru balsam dominate the composition. It's long lasting and has a heavy sillage.",11/01/13 15:24,MademoiselleMaya
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"I Looooooooove this fragrance!!
Totally divine and a really sexy scent that makes me feel like the ultimate woman :))

It's a warm fragrance with a soft but intense luxury amber note, sweet vanilla/almond and a touch of iris. The powdery note is well balanced with all notes in the perfume, creating a gorgeous iris-vanilla/almond balsamic fragrance. Really long lasting and such a yummy scent.

I'm a big fan of the hole Chloe Love line, but compared to the original Chloe Love this scent is more sophisticated, sexy and intense.... at the same time very modern!! It's a winner :-))

MUST HAVE AT HOME AT ALL TIME!!


Jag äääääälskar doften!
Helt gudomlig, en riktigt sexig doft som får mig att känna sig som den ultimata kvinnan :))

Det är en varm doft med en mjuk men intensiv lyxig ambernot, söt vanilj / mandel och en touch av iris. Den pudriga tonen är väl balanserad med alla delar i parfymen, vilket skapar en underbar iris-vanilla/almond balsamic doft. Sitter hela dagen och doftar gudomligt!!
 
Jag är ett stort fan av hela Chloe Love serien, men jämfört med den orginalet Chloe Love doftar denna mer sofistikerad, sexigt och intensivt .... samtidigt väldigt modernt! Detta är en vinnare :)

Love Eau Intense Chloé,"I just got this from my local department store and I am so far loving it!
I was eying on the Chloe line for ages, I was excited to try out the Roses de Chloe but I was massively disappointed as it just smelled like rosewater crabtree & evelyn handcream, starting off with a huge plastic and bitter note on my skin..
I was deciding between the original Chloe/ L'eau Chloe/Love then I suddenly picked up the Eau Intense tester. It just felt very warm and cozy to me (I am unable to pick up any notes by nose and describe them).
I just blindly bought it home without trying it on my skin coz I loved it!
Smells much stronger on skin, starts off like bitter powder and then transfers into a woodsy oriental then dries down to a spicy powdery smell. In my poor description, this perfume smells like dark purple flowers bumped into deep orange wood and sprinkled on top with a dust of old-fashioned face powder. Which is a good thing by the way!
I love it!",09/29/13 04:32,cryswang

Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Chloe Love Eau Intense is the perfect blend of sophistication and sensuality! Considering how much I love the original Love, Chloe I knew I had to get the eau intense version. I am so happy I did because you still get the lovely, soft lilac top notes with a powdery iris undertone. The vanilla note is more prominent which gives the eau intense version a more sensual vibe.

Love Eau Intense Chloé,"so, i was looking for something classy, something a little more grown up, but still with a little vanilla for my vanilla loving heart :P

i tested out a few scents, on paper and arms, got home, pet my dog and suddenly she stopped cuddling onto my leg and started sniffing my left arm. she has never done that before so i sniffed, to checked what it was and it was the original ""Love, Chloe"".
Next day i went back to the store to test it again and saw the ""Intense"" version. The notes said vanilla and i was sold.
It still smells grown up and subtle but still enough vanilla to make me happy :)
Very lovely, warm, deep scent to wear every day :)",07/04/13 08:53,HLVTCA09

Love Eau Intense Chloé,"There is one note in this that really smell afwul and give me a headache and make me nauseous. And it's a bit masculine, that's not a bad thing, but in this one i don't like it. Very longlasting and good sillage though.",01/12/13 04:36,elsa.jansen.14
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Woodsy, green, subtly dry, vanilla and nutty sweet. It's warm, it's cosy, powdery and perhaps very slightly smoky, also. That's the middle notes. And yes, after a while the smoky veil fades, and amber comes to prominence. I am falling for this perfume.

Update: after a couple of days, I can definitely say that the EDP has great longevity - I can still smell it very well after 12 hours. However, once the powdery, smokier notes have vanished, and the scent turns more towards amber, it then becomes very clean... reminding me a bit freshly washed linen. Maybe a bit too clean for me, girly type of scent - I like it slightly ""dirtier"" ;)",12/03/12 11:08,Małgoś

Love Eau Intense Chloé,Now when I have it I find the Intense version less overwhelming than EDP. What I wanted to reduce in EDP is sillage which is monsterous and harsh. Intense smells deeper and flows around the skin right from the beggining although I can't say there's no sillage. On the contrary it is translucent but quite persuasive. I'd say to all who wants to choose between EDP and Intense that if you are after the same as me (less into your face scent but with a beautiful translucent sillage) go for Intense.,11/14/12 09:45,SelenaSerena
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"The Intense version is so much better than the EDP. The EDP is being worn by so many in buses, trams, even by the salesladies.

Is the perfume that I wish more.
With ths perfume women do not even need to wear beautiful clothes, this scent is as good as any women who is using an image conveys se perfect that it does not need any more accessory.
All women should use it.
Just have a problem, this perfume is very expensive in my country but I think it is worth buying.",10/29/12 10:23,fdmc
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"I remember the first time I smelled it (I had a sample), it disappointed me a little bit: I found that the powdery dust that I loved so much in the classic Love here was a bit ""ruined"" by a slightly bitter note, annoying to my nose. So I gave the sample away! But now I've just received it in a swapping, and I could easy try it on my skin; so I realized that this note is very pleasant on my skin, and it gives to the entire composition an unusual(by my standards!)and refined touch.
It'is perhaps balsam of Peru note that gives this light leathery effect. And that's why the Chloe fragrance recalled to my mind another scent in which the powdery notes are accompanied with the note of leather: Putain de Palace of Etat Libre d'Orange (although in this case the powdery notes are those of rose and violet, while in Chloe they're given by iris, hyacinth and heliotrope).
I also found this Chloe a little bit similar to Malle Lipstick Rose, for its dust and ""cosmetic"" creaminess, even if in the Malle fragrance you can distinctly smell the violet rose.
For me, this is an amazing fragrance, but not so more intense than the classic Love.",10/19/12 06:11,maelleinrome
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Although I'm a guy, I have to write about this perfume, because it makes a statement. At first, when I smelled this one, I was not impressed at all, I thought this is the kind of fragrance that tries way too hard. Yesterday I was in a local department store and I decided to take a sniff of all Love Chloe's (the original, EDP Intense, Eau Florale). I sprayed a little on paper cards and EDP Intense was sooo much better this time. What popped into my mind was Christmas, somehow. So I decided to put a little bit on my wrist. At first I thought this has absolutely no sillage. But as time went by I started to smell this lovely fragrance. It smells powdery, clean, soapy, sweet, spicy, warm, unique, gourmand. This sits well on the skin too, and has good longevity. I will of course test this for a while now.
I would give 10 points out of 10 now.",10/02/12 10:57,marcello19
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Chloe's Love Eau Intense is perhaps a little too intense for me. I find the regular EDP versions heavy enough, so one step up in terms of projection, usually results in a head spin and a possible headache.

To start with, I'm not a big fan of Love, so this more intense flanker was not something I expected to enjoy. I tested it for the sake of seeing how the intense version compared to the original. Unfortunately they smell almost identical.

The opening of Love Eau Intense is quite a strong, powdery and soapy blend of lilac, iris and hyacinth. The blend itself is actually quite beautiful, but it's the strength of the opening that makes it a horrible experience for me. It's just way too strong. Every time I smell Love Eau Intense, my sensitive nose burns with the strength of it.

This is one of those fragrances that you have to be really careful with. If over applied it will easily become offensive, almost causing everyone, (including the wearer), to asphyxiate. It's also a good idea to let this fragrance dry on the skin before leaving the house.

The only part of Love Eau Intense that I liked, was the drydown. Thankfully the scent does become increasingly softer the longer it stays on the skin. The base notes are quite smooth and balanced, with a hint of iris, musk and vanilla.

Love Eau Intense is a rather warm and elegant fragrance when worn sparingly. Due to its 'out of this world' sillage and lasting strength, I would most likely choose to wear Love Eau Intense as a night-time only fragrance.",09/25/12 00:22,missk
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Don’t quite know what to think of it. There’s part of me that really likes the scent, the seriousness and floral side of it. And there’s also a part of me that gets pushed away whenever I sniff it for too long. It’s tempting but dangerous – seems warm and feminine, but if you’re too close it’s cloying, dry, woody, peppery, balmy. Makes me wonder is this fragrance really meant for the Chloe-girl kind of girl - younger, fashionable, flexible, easygoing, casual personalities?

Anyways. I’m discovering (slowly and painfully) that one of my biggest “turn-offs” could be iris.",08/22/12 07:12,meret
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"The original Love, Chloé with it's retro Elnett hairspray accord was cute enough.
This intense version is very good. The warmer base makes it richer and more expensive smelling. Plus Chloé signature clean musk fabric softener makes it easy to wear. The almondy heliotrope note gives it a modern day Après L'Ondée vibe.

Many fragrance launches nowadays don't get enough cash for the juice. This is why so many smell of shampoo or deodorant. Chloé is the only brand that succeeds to wow me with cheaper than cheap formulas.",08/20/12 10:38,cedriceccentric

Love Eau Intense Chloé,"This is the typical perfume that has made its way into my heart. I got a sample of it in my perfume shop and decided to try. Wearing it the first day, just after spritzing it on I thought it was ""nice"", but not soooo special. Then the flowers came out, one after the other, and I thought ""waaaaaay too much"", I am not usually a fan of these big florals and I thought of it being a very sophisticated perfume, something a little bit ""old-lady perfume"", nothing for teens and twenty-somethings... rather for the elegant ladies over 40.

But then came the drydown, and I fell in love. This soft, powdery vanilla! Just the way I love it! Soooo great! I truly couldn't stop sniffing my wrist - and the best thing is that it lasts almost forever.

Since I discovered the wonders of the drydown, I must say I like the top and middle notes better. And, I must admit, it is also time for me to grow up - with an ""adult"" perfume, he he! ;)",12/26/11 09:50,Kirancilla

Love Eau Intense Chloé,"This is a very nice surprise! The original Chloe Love is a powdery, vintage 70's scent - it achieves the brief very well without being ""old lady-ish"" and is more then pleasant. But Eau Intense is a notch above it: in the opening notes, I get leather, which I love - I guess it is the iris. I could not check how the notes developped as I tested this fragrance on a strip of paper. I found the strip in my handbag 2 days ago, and the drydown is still very strong (made my bag smell beautiful). I get spicy vanilla, with just a hint of flowers, which stops it from being sickly. This drydown is a warm skin scent, and I think I will invest in a bottle for the winter as my boss is currently wearing my signature Coco Mademoiselle. And the added bonus is that the bottle is very handbag friendly!",10/06/11 00:13,Budaqueen
Love Eau Intense Chloé,"Comparing to the regular Love the scent has changed drastically. The old-fashioned powder now doesn't prevail, but whispers and makes a lovely balance with the other part of the fragrance. The base of Eau Intense is gorgeous being vanilla balsamic. I don't know to explain but Eau Intense creates the impression of wealth. It doesn't smell like alcoholic drinks but can be compared to an expensive cognac.

I like Eau Intense much more than the regular Love, it is more modern and sexy. However I think some of Love fans will not accept the new version.",09/20/11 10:40,antonpan

Tuberosa 1974 Chloé,"I am so very excited, Jomashop has the 5.0 oz for $106 and I had to buy one blindly. LOVE the original Lagerfeld Chloe! I have many many vintage Chloes to compare.

OK- the review. Fresh from shipping yesterday.
It's not Chloe. The nozzle sniff wasn't Chloe, the sprays down my shirt had a HINT of Chloe-- like I said ""Oh there she is"" but no. It wasn't her. This is not buttery or mossy prob from modern notes. This is sheer and soapy- actually elegant and wedding like for 2025. It's VERY nice, but the tuberose is not the star and it's not Lagerfeld Chloe.
No regrets. I have a huge stash of BethCo Chloe- and this is very lovely.
If I crave Chloe, I can wear this to work- it's very 2025 friendly. It's also sheer, light sillage, and only lasted about 4-5 hours.",09/08/25 08:59,mschnabel666
Tuberosa 1974 Chloé,"Testing my sample; smoky florals cloaked in rich spices, tuberose is the focus.
Quite strong on the skin, very noticeable if someone is within arms' length.
Can be worn all year round.",08/10/25 19:54,Ferra_Verto
Tuberosa 1974 Chloé,"Opens quit strong, almost smokey spicy. Thankfully for me, that fades into a sweet, deep, slightly soapy tuberose. I have to be very careful with grounding notes, but this is well blended enough that nothing particularly jumps out to make me sick. Someone mentioned amber and another aldehydes, things that I definitely notice and hate in high quantities.
It’s really interesting because while it’s a strong floral when I put my nose right up to it, it’s almost intense, but the silage is very close to the skin. Like other Chloes I've tried, it is very clean smelling, and I expect it to linger linearly for a few hours before fading altogether.

I understand those who categorize this as more mature because it takes influence from the vintage version(?), but I think it’s perfectly wearable and not grandma coded or anything.",02/15/25 17:39,LoafyLady
Tuberosa 1974 Chloé,Very appropriate name. Smells like what I would imagine a tuberose-centered perfume in 1974 smelled like. For vintage lovers.,12/17/24 09:22,karinatfragrantica
Tuberosa 1974 Chloé,"Luckily, I have some of the original in mini form. It was a big favorite of mine in the early 80s, and if you are a white floral and amber lover, then you would have loved it, too.
If this is anything like that, then I really suggest you sample it because the OG was so lovely. As for me, there is no way I am going to purchase a bottle of a perfume I once loved that is bound to be different due to regulatory changes and costs an exorbitant amount of money when I still have the old stuff available. However, if I can get my hands on a decant or sample, I'm willing to give it a go just to see how it compares!",10/22/24 22:46,churinl
Tuberosa 1974 Chloé,"I’ve tried many Chloe perfumes over the years and so far have only liked one.

I’ve been wearing this for hours now and I just can’t stand it anymore. This beginning was nice, and that’s it. This is screechy and “high pitched” to me. So few perfumes annoy me and make me kinda angry but this is one of them. It’s got a nose burning quality to it. I think I’m done with the Chloe brand because I really love tuberose and thought I would love this.",05/12/24 03:31,Carpe Noctem
Tuberosa 1974 Chloé,"I just tested this on a paper tester in a Chloe perfume masterclass, where they told us that this is the same formula that Karl Lagerfeld used in 1975, just with the ingredients updated to the ones which are available today in the market.
On a paper tester, this is a beautiful tuberose - if you like tuberose, give this one a try.",05/11/24 23:28,eva.daisy.88
Tuberosa 1974 Chloé,"This floral fragrance is a glorious nod to the original amber-colored Chloé perfume by Karl Lagerfeld, launched in 1975. The 1974 in the name honors the year the Chloé brand itself was founded. The tuberose in the name could be misleading to some, as it is so well blended that the tuberose is not front and center. (This smells nothing like EL Private Collection Tuberose Gardenia.) If you loved the original Chloé (which you could buy at Nordstrom Rack 10 years ago for $30), you will be happy to learn that you can get it again at over 10 times the price. Regardless, this one is a throwback masterpiece to the days when perfumes were so masterfully blended, first and last sniff of the wrist smelled exactly the same. Flowers and aldehydes and sandalwood, oh my! This one is DIVINE.",04/23/24 10:14,EauDeLa
Tuberosa 1974 Chloé,"Absolutely gorgeous, stunning, a must try for tuberose lovers. I’ve tried a lot of tuberose fragrances. I’d say this one is closest to something in the Gucci Bloom line. However, Gucci Bloom is a cheap synthetic drugstore knockoff with no actual tuberose compared to this perfume. I was very disappointed by Bloom and mostly got an overly blended synthetic airy lily scented powder, never any actual real flower scents. It never projected on me and vanished in under 2hrs. I can really smell the tuberose in Chloe Tuberosa. It’s tuberose, lightly softened by a lily-esque flower. Reads to me like actual flowers, not a sweetened powder. Smells very expensive. Not sharp or aquatic. Projects well and lasts a long time. I’d also recommend this as an alternative to fans of the Lys 41 type of tuberose scents. I never tried the TF tuberose but it’s on my test list. I know some reviewers here tend to think tuberose is old fashioned or too mature, but this is youthful, innocent, beautiful. Represents the brand very well. This is definitely going on my wish list. This has a classic timeless elegance. The ingredients are quality and it shows.

I’d recommend it over Bloom 1000000%.",01/17/24 11:01,wondervalley666
Tuberosa 1974 Chloé,"Tuberosa 1974 on its own isn't really to my liking. It's a beautiful scent, but it just doesn't resonate with me.

HOWEVER, when I decided to layer it with Papyrus... OH MY, the result is an incredibly delightful, beautiful, elegant, sexy, and mature aroma that simply captivates.

This line of fragrances is meant to be used in combination with others, and I've particularly fallen in love with Papyrus. Yet, I felt it needed the company of a stronger scent, prompting me to pair it with Tuberosa, and the outcome is sensational. I ended up purchasing both, especially because there was a special promotion offering a free 50ml bottle of Papyrus when buying the 150ml Tuberosa.",08/16/23 21:29,Mimachan
Tuberosa 1974 Chloé,"Very strong spicy and nostalgic, 80's style White floral bouquet. I think it is more close to Ylang-ylang, not Tuberose",12/30/22 03:43,Mez0Nez

Cedrus Intense Chloé,"This one is deffinitely better than the original Cedrus, it doesn't have that strong pine toilet refreshener scent, it is much milder.
Despite the ""intense"" it us also much weaker, I litterary can't smell anything after 15minutes. The performance is too weak to compromise the price tag.",,Piragelis
Cedrus Intense Chloé,"By chance my hand reached for this perfume. I sprayed it on a blotter, smelled it and was stunned, absolutely incredible, like something from another world. I thought, why not, and applied it on my skin, hair and clothes.

You can definitely feel an oriental vibe. I live in an Eastern country, and I suppose the sandalwood revealed itself straight away. On the skin, the opening was very refined, and it reminded me of the scent of luxury hotel skincare products. The original version gave me the same association, which is why I didn’t apply it to my skin back then.

After a while, the fragrance settled and became a bit flatter, but still pleasant. Unfortunately, the final note ruined it for me. Once again I realised that I simply can’t stand anything with amber in it. It always cuts through my nose and smells somewhat cheap to me.

Of course, it’s all subjective. The opening is stunning. I still recommend testing it, as the first impression turned out to be misleading in my case. Now I’m sitting in a not-so-pleasant ambery cloud.",10/24/25 01:27,Karinaa_als
Cedrus Intense Chloé,"I own LV Fleur du Désert and Cedrus Intense, and to me they smell absolutely nothing alike. Not even remotely close to my nose.

Cedrus is my favorite scent in my collection but Cedrus Intense has a note in it (I think it's the sandalwood note) that sometimes makes my stomach turn. That chemical sandalwood note is also found in Impadia and Guidance 46. I much prefer the original which is much brighter, cleaner smelling and more effervescent.",10/10/25 21:51,mamafrag
Cedrus Intense Chloé,"This perfume reminds me to Fleurs Desert by LV but in economic way. The leather scent lasts well on my wrist. If u in the mood of bold and rebel, this perfume suits well!",10/05/25 08:18,Allv
Cedrus Intense Chloé,"Cedrus Intense has a sharp citurssy opening that is too akin to cleaning products for my liking. Thankfully, this soon subsides and gives way to a creamy aromatic woodsy base. This smells spa-like and zen, and reminiscent of the natural world. It is pleasant and unobtrusive and appropriate for most work environments. It just doesn't much feel like 'me.'",10/03/25 04:48,PerfumePixie87
Cedrus Intense Chloé,"This is very nice. I can understand why some use Guidance as a reference but thank goodness, it isn’t a dupe. Guidance OG and I do not get along. Tho there aren’t any sweet notes, I find this to have a tiny bit of sweetness. This is a spa like fragrance. It’s Likable and inoffensive but if
you don’t like woody/green, you may want to sample first",09/22/25 13:00,Evamomma
Cedrus Intense Chloé,"Cedrus is a very nice fragrance, Cedrus Intense is signature worthy. From the moment I sprayed it on I could tell it has a lot more depth than the original Cedrus. It's warmer, woodier and more complex, a little greener and wetter, not nearly as airy and dry as the original. It's more fun. It also lasts a lot longer and projects more strongly. The long term dry-down is very coniferous. I can't sense any leather in this but the sandalwood is a lot more pronounced and there are very clear amber notes. It's still a wonderful, relatively fresh and clean office fragrance, but should not be oversprayed since I can see it giving some people headaches.

I didn't even spray it on my clothes but a day later the smell can still be clearly felt from the tshirt I wore.",08/22/25 05:56,_Boleyn
Cedrus Intense Chloé,btw this has the craziest silage in the Atelier de fluers collection... I can smell my fd 6 feet away,08/21/25 00:15,barry1052
Cedrus Intense Chloé,"So I think between the two... Cedrus vs intense... I prefer the intense. This is really enjoyable and obvious woody scent. The other cedrus is brighter, slightly sparkly, powdery, a pinch of soapiness just like most other Chloe's in this line... and a little more fleeting. This one however is more bold, definitely more woody, just smoother and has more depth. I can actually pick up the cardamom and rose(!!) in this (which isn't listed on fragrantica) and it's absolutely stunning. Will need to test it a couple more times before deciding if it's full bottle worthy.",08/18/25 20:47,glass___petals
Cedrus Intense Chloé,"Awful Bisch synthetics, aroma is also bad. How this can have 4.10 is out of my understanding.",07/18/25 19:08,DYNABLASTER77
Cedrus Intense Chloé,"Also, on what planet does this smell anything like Guidance???

EDIT ***ok ok a few hours later in the dry down I do get it, though I would say it reminds me more of Guidance 46. Very creamy sweet amber sandalwood base. As much as I love OG Guidance this comparison is ruining Cedrus Intense for me so will need to test longer before jumping on that FB. I hate Impadia and that kind of ruined 46 for me a bit as that sickly sweetness is comparable and I find it nauseating.

Anyway, Cedrus Intense does not start as it means to go on. The opening and the dry down are quite different. This has been a wild ride.",07/05/25 23:43,Hansie
Cedrus Intense Chloé,"Wow, not at all what I was expecting and I love it! I saw woods and QB and thought it would be in the realm of Ganymeade but it's not. Something in the bright opening made me instantly think of childhood summers and southern hemisphere summer Christmas. Instant love. Getting a full bottle!",07/05/25 23:42,Hansie
Cedrus Intense Chloé,So I LOVE the OG Cedrus.. but unfortunately it lasted maybe an hour on my skin and projection was super weak. But this! The intense.. it’s not as fresh as the OG but it’s sexier! I don’t smell the bergamot.. but I do pick up on rose slightly it goes really well with the leather. You get the same woody vibes in intense as you do in the OG. Over all I sold my OG and bought this and I am loving it! Lastly I find it to be a more suitable fragrance for cooler temperatures. I find if it’s hot out it tends to remind me of musky BO. So it’ll be in my cool temp rotation!,05/27/25 19:28,HFlya

Cedrus Intense Chloé,"Very oriental sandalwoody.
Nothing like the original which is fresh cool spices on crisp cedars ..
This is little spice on warm ambers and big dose of sandalwood shifting the entire profile from fresh neat office friendly to autumn scent ..",04/14/25 03:23,Ceila88
Cedrus Intense Chloé,I like it a lot and I would definitely prefer this one over the original version. But I have to admit that it smells quite similar to all other recent releases by Quentin Bisch: beautiful clean and slightly spicy woods with radiant earthy (sort of ethereal) sillage 😈,04/11/25 13:59,Scent.guide
Cedrus Intense Chloé,"I have never liked woody, spicy, smokey scents but this has really blown my mind. It's not gormaund yet it's somehow delicious and I can't get enough of it.
Its warm, spicy, woody, mature, slightly green. It makes me think of sitting by a crackling campfire with the feeling of the burn when drinking strong whiskey. None of it an appealing image to me yet somehow it still works.


Edit: the longevity is insane i can still smell it after 24hrs",03/29/25 10:20,Leggo Eggo

Cedrus Intense Chloé,"I have the original Cedrus (obsessed, wear it often) and I wanted to try this after seeing it at an airport. It's stunning. It reminds me of Santal 33. This lasts forever and honestly I don't really think it smells that much like the original (light, citrusy, mineral-y, clean); I get woods, amber, vetiver and leather most of all in this. It would absolutely deserve a place in my collection but I've already planned on purchasing Orpheon by Diptyque (I'm a sucker for the juniper note) and this would be very similar, and it's quite a bit more expensive than Diptyque. It's beautiful and 10/10; honestly this entire Atelier des Fleurs line did not disappoint.",03/26/25 21:37,parfumparfan
Cedrus Intense Chloé,"Testing Cedrus Intense from a 1.2 ml Chloe official sample.

Citrusy, green, fresh in the opening and warm, ambery sandalwood in the dry down. The opening is truly beautiful in the way that smells so zesty and uplifting, but it settles down into a very pleasant, likeable creamy, warm blend of sandalwood and cedar. I’m getting a slightly pickled undertone from this scent, but not in an overwhelming, unpleasant way.

The fragrance smells absolutely amazing throughout all stages of development on skin, but it’s not a scent DNA that I would want to wear often enough to justify purchasing a bottle! It’s one of those perfumes where I can appreciate the craftsmanship that went into creating it, without having the urge to buy a bottle.

It’s a very nicely done one, buttery sandalwood forward fragrance with a fresh spicy greenness lurking in the background until the scent disappears from skin. Has a moderate to long lasting presence on skin with noticeable sillage for the first hour. I assume that applied on clothing Cedrus Intense would perform better, like most scents do. Comfortably unisex, I would wear it! Gives me outdoorsy vibes, like walking in a forest or hiking on a mountain with lush vegetation!",03/22/25 06:09,Maya lilac
Cedrus Intense Chloé,"Cedrus Intense—warmth pressed into warmth, spice curling into cream. Vanilla, thick and sweet, made denser by woods that smolder with crackling depth and slight acidity. Cedar, yes, but not the crisp kind; this is richer, deeper, infused with an almost resinous glow. Like embers burning low, hot, hot, hot.

The spice isn’t a sharp bite, more of a slow bloom—maybe nutmeg, a whisper of cardamom. It's dry, earthy, thankfully grounding all that sweetness before it collapses into itself. But in humid weather, all gets just a little too cloying, a strong cloak of warm air refusing to let out

In the cold, though, I imagine it might melt just right, unfurling like the softest wool, spice sparking against the chill, cedar turning plush instead of oppressive. Akin to other intense flankers, this scent is very much built for frosted air and heavy knits, so in my foolishness here—here, I’m drowning in it. If only Singapore had the seasons to test it properly....",03/16/25 23:42,luvoxlixir
Cedrus Intense Chloé,"This is nice, however I don't think I could wear this. I thought I’d prefer this over the OG due to the bergamot note, and I do absolutely love the opening, but the dry down I just don’t enjoy. I so wish the opening remained throughout. What a shame! Although there’s no cardamom listed in this, I can 100% smell it. Unfortunately it’s a note I can struggle with and in this I do find it nauseating. As nice as this scent is, it’s one I’ll have to pass on. I actually find the OG more wearable and lasts longer",03/12/25 12:18,CaroleAnne81

Cedrus Intense Chloé,"Creamier and sweet version of the OG Cedrus. I love both. Extremely. When I want to a heavier, more complex version of Cedrus, I reach for this one. Usually when I know I'll be in a colder environment or during the evenings. Dries down to a very creamy sandalwood.",03/06/25 00:48,Sky Go
Cedrus Intense Chloé,"This is a very fresh-woody fragrance. It smells fresh and slightly creamy woody (sandalwood) at the beginning it turns into a leathery rose but the rose here is not not sweet( I think fragrantica’s notes is missing the rose) at last it’s not a dirty leather its a very very clean leather like other Chloe fragrances they all have a clean DNA but not as soapy as other Chloe.

I think I prefer the OG edp more it suits the concept of atelier de Fleurs more , more airy and clean it’s more versatile too.
Not a bad release but the og is just too good",01/27/25 04:57,barry1052
Santalum Chloé,"It may just be me but, this smells very similar to the sandalwood vanilla body scrub by onyx. You can find it at Walmart. The body scrub smells really good and lingers on the skin. It’s around $7. Am I gonna sell my bottle of Santalum? YUP:)",09/11/25 18:51,DeeDukes
Santalum Chloé,"This is pretty! ... But not a love for me. It's a very polite sandalwood with a touch of soapiness. Very feminine to my nose. Almost a gateway sandalwood... It's smooth, but I definitely wouldn't say ""milky"" - more clean than anything.",08/18/25 20:28,glass___petals

Santalum Chloé,"Oh, Santalum. Santalum is just… everything. That slightly iris-y, perfumey edge that I often find off-putting, is simply swoonable here. It's a kiss, a soft-focus pat of powdered skin, an intimate moment of femininity. Powdery, yes, but not at all antique—more like the delicate veil of something familiar and romantic. And the sandalwood, that's the crème de la crème. Silky—that doesn’t even begin to cover it—like liquid velvet poured over warm, sunlit, enrapturing wood. It has this gentle, savory undertone that sneaks in every now and then too—not overwhelming, and just the ideal touch to add a cozy gourmand depth, like a steamy turmeric milk, full in body and cream. Mostly, oh mostly, it’s in the woods. A soft, comforting warmth that wraps round you, never sharp, always tender. Always tender, always plush, maybe a little yummy, and always luxurious without the being any cold. Just… everything.",01/24/25 02:15,luvoxlixir

Santalum Chloé,"I have only just received this after sampling it months ago in a store. I also bought Ode to Dullness by JHAG. Comparing them side by side is an interesting experience, them both being Sandalwood fragrances. Santalum is much more effervescent, floral and sweet, despite none of the notes hinting at that. To me Santalum is a very cosy, clean, feminine take on Sandalwood. It is much more complex than I would have thought from other reviews. It has that woody undertone that makes it feel comfortable yet sophisticated but it also smells like laundry fresh from the dryer, crisp clean linen and expensive yet understated bodylotion. It is inoffensive but evokes pictures of put together women in smart casual attire. I can see myself wearing this a lot. The opening is surprisingly refreshing with it settling into a creamy, quiet, feminine sandalwood that is a perfect daytime, office scent.",04/04/24 04:45,Binst145

The good thing is that, it's not one of those sickening sandalwood scents, everything is in moderation here.
It's not at all a complex scent, but that's not always a bad thing.
Very weak on my skin so, for the price they're asking, hum, not sure it's worth it!
If you like sandalwood, this is something you need to check out, just don't expect fireworks, it's a very simple scent, but it's also nicely done.",04/04/23 09:09,Not_So_Perfumy

SOLO-SANDALWOOD.Tried once in the airport but I can already say this is very promising, true “Indian - Mysore” sandalwood oil profile, without much change. It really does smell like pure indian sandalwood. Though fascinating it is, it can also let many people down because of incorrect associations they may have based on other fragrances mentioning sandalwood in their names but actually smells nothing like it. Example: Le Labo - Santal 33.

Santalum is muted, just like the real oil. It will not shout loud, but it may create an inviting sillage that others get curious than the wearer.

I would say that this is a motherly and inviting scent, and it's signature scent worthy. It's kinda sad that it's discontinued.

"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","I get why so many reviews says that this smells soapy. When you open the bottle and spray it on your skin the soapy scent is strong. I think it has something to do with it's green accords. It's fresh too. first it's strong, but once you give it time to lay on your skin it is the most feminine scent I've smelled. I wouldn't say that the dry down is powdery, but it's more creamy and sweet. The after scent of the sweetness is like a trail of AG Cloud. The dry down is just sooo good and feminine. I just hate how it comes off strong once you spray it but that dry down is making me love and keep wearing this perfume. I've been finding perfumes that are floral and powdery at the same time yet with a trail of sweetness that lingers and this is it! I'm not a big fan of floral and fruity perfumes so this perfume is perfect for me. Don't knock this before you try it. That dry down will change your mind, just give it time.

Ebay has decant samples for those who are trying to avoid an expensive blind buy.",04/02/21 13:40,Jaxie23
"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","I bought a bottle and was super excited as I love both the original and the Intense versions - I just KNEW I would love this one too! Buuut, the sweet pea mixed with the tea is odd-smelling. The opening is beautiful and the dry down is identical to the original Love. The mid, which lasts a long time, is not a good mix to my nose... Gorgeous bottle... Full 2.5 oz up for trade!",11/27/20 09:03,MsLittlejohn

"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","Too late, too late to the game here. I’m always on the hunt for the best soapy scents. This nails it for me. Unfortunately bottles of Love, Chloe and her flankers are going for extortionate prices on the internet now. I saw a rare mini in a shop and grabbed it.

Powdery and soapy are some of my favourite accords. Love, Chloe Eau Florale leans more soapy than powdery for me. But what a lovely, delicate fresh-out-of-the-shower soapiness. Feminine, clean, relaxed. It is the feeling of basking in the sun by the window after a bath, curtains billowing in the wind and the smell of soap-scented damp skin slowly drying.

Ugh, I need this.",04/11/20 20:59,fillifelle
"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé",Such a soft yet rich and long lasting scent. It just melts into my skin so gently. I like to add a pomegranate/blackberry lotion to layer this and they bring out the best when combined. All of her notes really shine together and are perfectly blended. I am a fan of mini's due to frequent blind buys. This is a winner!,01/08/20 12:26,Moreluvr
"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","This is such a pretty fragrance, especially for Spring. The tea and mate makes it slightly bitter green while still having the powdery goodness of Love. Less powder, more herbal freshness. Also sweet in a refreshing way, not custardy like the original. Sweet pea flowers as I perceive them (thanks BBW) are sweet with fruity nuances, which I do get here. Extremely wearable, more wearable than the other two.

As much as I am smitten over it I've proven to myself this and all the Love, Chloes are simply not ""me."" Have you ever loved a perfume for how it's constructed, the way it smells and basically everything about it but for some reason don't feel fully comfortable wearing it? This is me with the Love line. I think they're phenomenal perfumes, the best of Chloe for sure ( this goes for all of them), but I'm not the polite girly girl for them. The older I get the more I realize I only wanna keep fragrances that totally get me.",03/16/19 22:34,Swedelish

This is my new signature scent. I just feel like ""me"" while wearing it. So pretty, clean, fresh, but also with a bit of powder.

As with the original Love, Chloe...give it a few minutes to settle in. You'll be pleasantly surprised!",10/29/18 06:47,elmccullar
"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","I am head over heals in love with this! I find it absolutely wonderful how it is BOTH powdery, really clean soapy AND brisk and fresh! There is really this zing in the opening from the tea and the mate leaves that quickly reveals the sweet, sweet sweet pea. Sweet pea is almost too girly for me, but... nah, I adore it here! Powder, woods and musk embrace the tea and floral notes and the balance is supreme. It´s quite linear if not all linear and silage is medium and longevity phenomenal. It never gets too powdery and never falls into baby powder territory (nothing wrong with that, but I rather not smell like baby) and the tickling brightness of the tea follows all the way. I just scored an almost full 50 ml bottle and am totally happy that I did since my other one is running dry. This is sexy clean at its best!",10/23/18 07:42,piahellgren
"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","Smells like the most EXPENSIVE feminine soap ever. Way cleaner and fresher than Chloe Love. Very ladylike & princessy to me, like something a modern-day Grace Kelly would wear. Has that Coco Mademoiselle vibe, but with more powder and less citrusy notes. Also less commonly worn than Coco, which is a plus for me. It can be a bit overpowering, so I like to spritz sparingly. Great longevity as well! You'll definitely be noticed wearing this. Try it in the summer, that's when it does it's magic.",04/15/18 16:53,aelserafy

No pun intended.",09/09/17 09:46,Ladybedwell
"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","Soap and powder. Both of the best quality possible. It brings to my mind freshly washed and ironed white shirt on extremely beautful woman. Long, dark hair, big eyes and smile of Mona Lisa. She stands on the hill, wind brushes her hair while she is simply enjoing the view on the valley. It's summer and there is scent of flowers all around. Or maybe it's her perfume. Flowers mixed with freshness of white shirt. Peaceful heaven.

Goes without saying that I love Chloe Love Eau Florale. :) <3",07/02/17 05:22,agarobka
"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","Sweet pea and green tea really work together, don't they. I would not have thought of that combination myself. It's pretty nondescript though, pleasant clean floral. I spilled some almond essence on my hand while baking muffins though, and the bitter almond note enriches this fragrance perfectly! I wish that note was actually in there, to be honest.",02/10/17 13:24,Madrona
"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","spring fragrance. the scent is exactly the same as the EDP, but not as long lasting. the powdery notes are lighter, too. i think it is a interesting option for someone who wants one to apply through the day after spraying some before leaving home, you could use the EDP version and then retouch it through the day, looking for a less heavy sillage.

"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","A pretty nice fragrance for summer. I smell the mate and sweet pea, the tea, a bit aromatic as it starts but quickly turns into the softest sweetest pink powder. It smells like a boudoir scent very girly. I wish it had more fruit in it or more flowers but whatever they did to this it smells really really good. Sometimes when I don't want to wear this and I put on a different fragrance I still like to smell this scent by putting my nose to the nozzle of the spray. This is really good.",03/19/16 18:46,Southern Blonde

"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","For an EDT, it sure lasts forever. The only perfume I own that I call ""beautiful"" without hesitation, even though there are others I love more intensely. My most-used summer fragrance for work, as it is neither offensive nor cloyingly sweet. I do adore the original Love, Chloe EDP more than this, however this Eau Florale should be for those who somehow like Love EDP, but find it old-ish. Both are permanent fixtures on my vanity, along with Chloe EDP, EDT, Intense, and See by Chloe. Fan of the house.",12/16/15 23:44,tessaeastgate

It's fresh as well. I no longer smelled the heavy tea and woody notes. I tried to think what could have made me dislike it before and i have only my nose to blame.

"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","This is too heavy for me. I did not like this at all. I did not detect any floral notes.

But I still can't imagine wearing it because of those top notes and sharpness.
It's a powder bomb.",08/14/14 05:16,ScarlettX
"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","As other reviewers have mentioned this perfume is very similar to Chloé Love, which happens to be one of my favourite perfumes. I do actually prefer the scent of this one, however, as it has a freshness to it that the other one doesn't.

Had the staying power been equal to Chloé Love it would have been my all time favourite, but unfortunately it wears off way to fast (unlike Chloé Love), so I'm beginning to think that I may have to combine the two. ;)",08/11/14 06:50,Safira

"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","Chloe Love Eau Florale (CLEF) is similar to Chloe Love, but not the same. CLEF starts out much fresher, with the sweet pea and the almost citrus-like tea notes dashing in full force. A bit overwhelming at first, CLEF quickly settles into a softer floral powdery perfume. It's similar to Chloe Love's powder notes, only less heavy; a soft dusting of powder on clean skin, where Chloe Love can sometimes feel like breathing in close to the actual powder puff.

I find CLEF a perfect alternative for Chloe Love when the weather heats up. However, because sillage and longevity are significantly weaker than Chloe Love's, and because I find the opening stages somewhat bracing, I prefer Chloe Love. That is not to say that I don't appreciate CLEF, though. I'm very happy with my bottle and I'm 90% sure I will replace it once I run out.

CLEF is absolutely perfect for when I want to smell unequivocally beautiful without making any waves. I find these types of perfumes very soothing and often reach for them when I can't make up my mind about which scent I want to wear.",08/03/14 18:39,jessbug
"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","Very powdery, but it is not the worst. It smells so chemical! Like some perfumed washing detergent. Well, even detergents smell better because not so powdery. All in all, not for me.

Update: I've tried it again, but my impression hasn't changed much. Lots of powder. I could smell also some green notes which surprisingly did not add any freshness to this scent.
Though honestly I have to admit that powdery green scents have been never my favorite ones. No surprise then.",07/07/14 02:49,Arlene-Beatrix
"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","I received a sample of this today. I think this is a disappointment for me. On my skin, it is a linear smell after a short period of a delicious array of flowers. If only the flowers remained throughout the fragrance which is a shame. However, it lacks the richness and creamy aspects of the Chloe EDP Love or Intense. I smell an almond and a screechy smell which makes me sick which gives me weakened soapy finish. Unfortunately, I do not smell the lovely sweet pea smell, which I was after. I can understand why some people would like a weakened fragrance, while it seems to linger softly for a long time. I will not purchasing a large bottle. Unfortunately, the lack of rich floral flowers gives this perfume a fly spray, green and bitter powdery smell combination which I find offensive. However, I recommend one to sample this first, while others love this. I am happy I did not rely on positive views, because it does not work for me. The smell is 1/5, the silage 1/5 and the strength is 1/5 for me. It is not quality for the price. For the 75mls EDT of this fragrance is $89.00 on Ebay, which is the cheapest, because it is not available in Australia.",07/01/14 01:19,aber19
"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","I'm so happy to see how many people love this. The Eau Florale version has an incredible lasting power and I can feel it even after 12 hours.

"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé",This was a blind buy for me but I have no regrets. It is such a beautiful soft and very feminine perfume IMHO. Powdery and flowery at the same time. I usually stay away from perfumes with tea in but I am so glad that I bought this. Amazing longevity and silage for EDT. It lasts 7 hours on my skin and even longer on my jacket.

"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","First of all I must say that I just loooove the orginal Chloé Love.... and this one is just as adorable :))

The scent is a powdery divine floral scent with notes of sweet pea and then refreshed by green tea leaves. It makes me feel sophisticated, clean and refreshed in a very womanly way.

It is an EdT but it doesn't fade away fast and I can still notice the scent at the end of the day :-)

It's an amazingly beautiful classic scent. It's a keeper fore sure !!!!! :-))

Ps. Ran out of it and on my way to buy a new one :)


Till och börja med måste jag säga att jag bara ääääälskar, orginal Chloé Love .... & denna är lika bedårande :))

Doften är pudrig med gudomliga noter av sweet pea och en uppfräschande ton av grönt te. Detta får mig att känna mig sofistikerad, ren och fräsch på ett mycket kvinnligt sätt.

Det är en EdT, men dunstar inte snabbt och mot slutet av dagen kan jag fortfarande känna doften :-)

It does slightly remind me of EA True Love but it's not as sharp, it is much softer and settles down to a beautiful soft floral. I don't get any honey, more a slightly green, powdery floral - I guess the prominent note is the sweet pea but its not one I have smelt before in a fragrance. It is a really beautiful perfume and I would be tempted to buy a FB. It is worlds apart from my usual strong oriental loves but a change is good!

This fase slowly morphs into a day long very subtle and powdery /creamy base, with the sweet pea playing hide and seek in the background. It does not really compare to the original or any off the perfumes I got, though I could easily layer it with senseous nude last night !

It's both light and warm, nothing about it feels heavy. The floral note feels a little bit vintage and perfumey, in the way that Chanel No 5 does. They don't smell alike, but they feel similar, classy florals that have a lightness and lift to them, very feminine.
This one is also I think hugely versatile. I think it would work very well in almost any weather and it could easily be office appropriate or for a formal dinner or even jeans and t-shirt days for a bit of added glamour.
Very nice and well done, unsurprising from Chloe I guess.",03/29/13 01:35,DresdenDoll
"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","I'm very surprised there is no Magnolia in this! The opening is quite sharp, but within minutes it settles very delicately on the skin. To me, it's very light, well done, creamy Magnolia. I'm enjoying it.. I've always found Magnolia is often over done, but whatever is in this, works well.its not entirely fresh and airy, because of the element of creaminess in it adds warmth, but indeed it is very light and ideal for warmer weather.

"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","I find this fragrance far more favourable than Love by Chloe EDP. The original made me sneeze with its bold sillage and sharp, almost fizzy powderiness. Thankfully, Love by Chloe Eau Florale has a much softer presence.

It's really pretty and flowery on the skin, with the familiar powder note found in the original. The lilac has been replaced with sweet pea in this flanker, and the overall feeling is more fresh and airy.

A subtle tea note in the drydown, provides an interesting green quality. It's what makes this fragrance so suitable for Spring and Summer.

Love by Chloe Eau Florale has surpassed all my expectations. I enjoyed it enough to recommend it as a wedding day fragrance to one of my dear friends. Here's hoping that she'll use it for her special day.

Fans of the original Love EDP will be pleased to know that Love by Chloe Eau Florale has much in common with its predecessor, however the softer aspects may find this fragrance some new fans. I know that I personally would choose this flanker over and above the EDP and the Intense version. Actually, make it my pick out of the entire Chloe range.

The packaging is as always, very classy and chic. The lighter pink bottle is a nice touch. This flanker has my personal tick of approval. Very nicely done.",03/19/13 05:51,missk

I couldn't find this fragrance where I live. It's available at chloe.com though. The company didn't mention anything if this one is limited or permanent I had to find out myself. All other chlo fragrances are available though.
Update 13th March:
In cosmoty.com this fragrance is due in March 2013, it means not all countries have it yet. I'll wait & see if it's ever gonna be available where I live cause all what I saw is chloe love & chloe love intense.",02/21/13 03:11,Red Rose

"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","I absolutely adore this fragrance :) I tried it on so many times before finally getting a bottle today and I'm definitelly pleased with my purchase! Personally for me this is a unique scent in my collection since I don't really have any powdery/clean scents but I think this is already up for becoming a favourite of mine!

Love is a perfect feminine, almost girly yet sophisticated fragrance. When I first spray this I can smell a beautiful blend of floral and powdery notes that blend in together to a lovely clean soapy scent. After a while I start to pick up the green tea notes :) I'm in love with Chloe Love!",02/01/13 13:59,ellapage
"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","HUGE soap-monster! Smells of the finest triple milled soap: fresh, clean, sudsy and refined. The sillage and longevity is nuclear, luckily it smells fantastic. Its not thick- its airy and diffusive, but it is very potent. If youre loking for the perfect true-to-life soap scent, this is it. The Clean line of scents and Philosophy's Pure Grace come nowhere near the authenticty and quality of this one.",01/29/13 21:30,L'eaulita
"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","I tried it on at the airport, and kept sniffing my wrist throughout the flight. what an addictive yet fresh and clean scent! So today I had then today I had to go out and buy it. I got the 30 ml bottle which is perfect for the handbag so I can top off during the day or night. The bottle is so elegant and stylish with the lid connected to the bottle through a chain. Neat design.
The fragrance starts out slightly green, but not as green as a green fragrance like Green Tea or Chanel Chance eau fresh or Chloe Lèau. The green note is just a fresh clean note, then it to me quickly turns into a supersoft, light perfectly powdery, clean, fresh yet elegant floral.

This fragrance is just heavenly perfection if you are looking for a scent that is elegant and sophisticated without being heavy, and clean and fresh without being sticky or cheap.
This fragrance is like a soft powdery petal falling from a clean sky on a beautiful summer day. A classic.",01/10/13 11:44,puselabber

"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","This fragrance is lighter scent which is clean, powdery soft, fresh and floral particularly very feminine and airy. Actually very easy to love like its love sisters. It is an eau de toilette, so it evaporates slightly faster than what I am used to, but it is an amazingly beautiful scent. At the end of the day it is still lingering and noticeably soft. I'm impressed to be honest. Really a sweet, floral and soapy clean-fresh scent! I simply recommend this during hot weather days.",12/26/12 05:33,mjb28

"Love, Chloe Eau Florale Chloé","Better than the original chloe love, which has a plasticky powdery trail that is way too strong for my nose.

The floral notes tame the powdery notes, giving rise to a very pleasant and natural smelling fusion of both.

However, powdery notes are stil too dominant...it would be better for me if the flora notes are stronger. Smelling ths trong powdery notes for too long makes me feel sick.",10/14/12 08:29,siying.hong

I am currently testing Love, Chloé Eau Florale and it's so delicate but present, so tender and embracing that makes me feel wrapped up in love, and a better person.
This is NOT a fragrance for the fatal woman. It's a fragrance for the one that believes in eternal love and that this world can be a better place.

Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"I have complicated feeling at the first sniff. It has nice aquatic scent but I can smell green and spices at the same time. So I cannot decide if I like it or not. I keep telling myself 'This is the worst Nomade flankers ever!' and 'I do not want to smell like this all day'.
BUT the scent became so heavenly after dry down. It is very sweet and sensual. I keep sniffing myself all the time. I do not expected much about the sillage and longevity from aquatic fragrance but this one is actually good. I still prefer Nuit d’Egypte but I am glad I give this one a try.",10/29/25 21:02,ShiraJemJem
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"This is a jasmine bomb with oriental spices! It smells really green to me and reminds me of nature some how. Like a home filled with natural fragrances in every corner. This is not something I would ever wear but I would respect someone who could pull this off! It is quite a mature scent to me but not in the fancy lady kind of style, more lika an older woman living an organic life in a cottage and likes to spend time outside. A fresh, floral and spicy perfume all at once. I think I would like this as a candle to put in my bathroom for relaxation!",10/11/25 08:10,sandraaalindgren
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"As someone from Egypt, Chloè Lumiere d'Egypte holds a deep sense of nostalgia for me; it reminds me of home. There’s the intensity of Cairo in its heart, balanced by the peace of the land and the warmth of its people ☀️🌊🤍.

It carries an oriental spice that feels both powerful and graceful, and then comes the jasmine: that same enamoured jasmine you smell when you walk past blooming trees under the bright Egyptian sun. Paired with lily of the valley, it creates a scent that’s luminous, elegant, spellbinding, and kind.

A single spray lasts beautifully for over five hours, making it perfect for everyday sophistication or special evenings. After testing over 20 perfumes, this was the one I chose as my wedding fragrance, and it couldn’t have been more perfect.

I ADORE this fragrance. If you give it a try it will lift your spirit and wrap you in the warmth of the Egyptian sun. You won’t be disappointed ✨",10/10/25 05:39,eman_sena18
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"On my skin: Very green, bright, ladylike, unique opening. Harmonious and it reminds me of a handmade body cream from Africa, very seductive and mystical. It's not sweet (my type of scents), but I love it. In the middle notes it gets resinous , rather than green. I definitely get the resins... thankfully it doesn't remind me too much ""church"", but myrrh is clearly there. It's the only thing that makes me hesitant to buy it. It keeps its feminine notes throughout (jasmine + something else), but not as in the amazing opening. I definitely prefer its opening. I get 0 cinnamon. Imo it suits mature, put together, old money, conservative, religious women. Not so ""nomade"" 😆 I smelled it next to Prada Paradoxe: same vibe, but this is the 40s mother and PP is the 20s daughter. Edit: yeah, it has something comforting, motherly, trustworthty, reassuring (I guess it's the myrrh). It's very elegant from the start till its drydown which stays consistent without dissapointing surprises. Hmm...then I'll might get a bottle.",10/02/25 08:59,Bella B
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"Some people say it's a mature scent, but I disagree. I picture an elegant woman who knows what she wants. This isn't a sweet or energetic perfume; it has a slight greenish edge, but it's not entirely green; the floral aspect is prominent. It's a very clean scent, suitable for office use. The longevity is quite satisfactory. I can smell the jasmine, and I adore it. It's lighter, more aquatic, and shares the same DNA as Nuit d'Egypte. I'd say it's a scent for those who don't like to take risks. When I'm unsure what to wear and don't want to draw too much attention, I'd spray this scent :) It's not very diffused, but someone hugging you or sitting next to you will definitely smell it.

There is some clever compositioning, its a true gem.
Thank You!",08/22/25 11:11,Katiebirdie
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"The opening is spicy, pungent, very green.
After a few minutes, the acquatic aspect starts to emerge, but the green note (or at least what I process as green note), is still the strongest, until you get to the final hour of the perfume, which is definitely more acquatic. I dont pick up any sweetness at all.
It's quite refreshing, it smells of wet green leaves and water, but in a nice way.
Summer weather appropriate. The name Egypt seems completely irrelevant here🍃☀️💧",08/03/25 07:22,Federica76

Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,shes kind of wierd. sweet but a bit psycho. put together but a bit edgy. I can't explain her and I love her for it,07/15/25 09:17,katxoxo
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"The balsamic, ceremonial, sacred notes from the original Nuit d’Égypte have moved to the base here. In the OG, they’re woven through all three layers, with the myrrh making a grand entrance. Here, they’re in the background, and white florals take the lead.

This is clearly an airy white floral spin on Nuit d’Égypte, and I have to say, I’m a bit surprised by it. It’s a fine fragrance on its own, but for me, the original is just on another level - a creation that holds a special place in perfumery.

Because really… why would you want a light, airy version of something that is so essentially not light, airy, or white floral? Lumière is pretty, but it simply can’t compete with the depth and presence of Nuit.",07/05/25 06:01,MetaMystic
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"The blend is formal and abstract. It opens with abundant honeyed wood and fresh green spices.
The fragrance of the flowers is fresh and fruity for a moment, and then watery wafts carry a creamy air with a delightful mist of elemi. The effect is similar to the deep aroma of fig leaves (it lingers throughout), so the ambery resins and spices become creamy while remaining dusty, bitter, slightly citrusy, green and woody… IMHO, it brings a feeling of serenity, accentuated by stimulating sparkles.",06/27/25 00:04,PFortune
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"This is an ode to the romantic, magic notion of Egypt that many of us carry in our memories from history lessons in school.

It's the sight of a Felucca with crisp, white sails floating down the shimmering Nile while a light breeze carries the sigh of blooming jasmine along the banks of the river.",06/26/25 14:31,ruin_raider
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"This is a bright, clean, and easygoing fragrance. I usually don’t go for clean girl scents, since neither my style, makeup, nor wardrobe really fits that aesthetic. But this one stands out for me, it’s the most wearable clean fragrance I’ve come across. :) There’s something subtly edgy about it that I really enjoy. It’s perfect for daytime, I’d wear this to brunch, cinema, a cafe, or to a sunny walk.",06/24/25 05:14,seralopsmells
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"This perfume smells like you're in Egypt, sitting by the bank of the Nile as the tall palm trees rustle above you on a hot summer day. There is a calm, watery freshness carried by the lotus, blending beautifully with jasmine, spices and myrrh. I sense a green nuance (possibly a fig tree accord) and, from what I gather, I'm not the only one who senses it. If you enjoy fig scents, I think this is the one to try.",06/16/25 10:11,neth
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"Nicest of the Nomades IMO. It's juicier, fruitier, younger and brighter than the others, and more summer fun energy/solar vibes than the OG.

Unsure what note is giving the tarty, juicy, slightly green edge - but it gets more subtle in the dry-down and when the whole thing becomes more reminiscent of the OG (but stays younger and brighter overall). I can't really spot the resins & spices in this that are strong players in the Nuit flanker and in this note list.
Unique and addictive to sniff - will enjoy playing with it in different weather.",06/08/25 03:00,RidiculousDicko

Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"It is lovely. Better than Nuit d'Egypte that is heavy on particular jasmine thats a bit sour. This is bright, crisp, floral without being obviously jasmine and lotus. This duo plays together nicely. There is something slightly bitter in the front that is so very Chloe. In the background this is sweet. The sandalwood is there but also not obvious. It is animalistic-resinous in the drydown, oriental but refined by the French. I think I like the classic Nomade edp the most, then Nomade Naturelle then this. I dont know only the Nomade Naturelle Jasmin.
I think this is a safe blind buy and a lovely gift cause this is timeless, elegant, cheerful and universal with regards to weather. Today is a stormy, rainy hot spring day and I am so comfortable in it yet I feel it on myself 9 hours already.",05/29/25 11:08,MademoiselleMaya
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"I can swear I got a fig note from the opening, so that I fell in love with this scent",05/12/25 02:32,elif79
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"If Nuit d’Egypte is the whisper of an evening, Lumière d’Egypte is the sigh of a golden dawn.

Both perfumes offer the same silky balm, the same tender ointment laid on the skin, still that warm breath of the Orient that gently caresses the senses without ever overwhelming them. It’s a velvety, spicy, and rounded scent.

But here, the light enters. Jasmine blooms more clearly, lotus offers its fresh aquatic note without breaking the creamy base. It’s the same family, the same olfactory dynasty: that of oriental caresses, but this time under the clear sky of an Egypt bathed in daylight.

Two faces of the same dream. I really like these Egyptian flankers.",04/25/25 05:50,Saveria
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"To my nose, this is a green fig and warm jasmine fragrance. I think the warmth comes from the Myrrh but there has to be fig in this. That's what's coming across on my skin. It does settle down a bit as it transitions from the opening to the dry down, and the jasmine becomes equal with the fig (that I'm picking up but isn't a listed note). It's nice but nothing groundbreaking IMO. I appreciate that the Nomade DNA is still present in this fragrance, as it should be since it's a flanker.",04/14/25 05:36,Thegrimmreaderr
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"The Nomad d'Egypte editions are so different to the other Nomads, I had to try them in the store and I was truly mesmerized. They don't even remind me of Nomad. I prefer Lumiere and bought it asap.

Lumiere is so niche and weird, but in a very good way: its warm, creamy, ambery, spicy, all in a subtle non-cloying way, and at the same time its also fresh and aquatic. I would have thought these accords would clash, but it doesn't and its just so addictive. Its not a fill the room scent, which I love, I find this very classy. I don't get any coconut here like others review, I do not like coconut in a fragrance so that's lucky.

Update: This performs very well in a cold season for me, when its warmer I don't like this on me at all, it went weirdly fishy on me, sooo weird, enough so it has been putting me off wanting to use it, its a sell. It must be a mix of the aquatic and the spices throwing it in that direction.",04/10/25 00:52,locg
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"Very tropical smelling to me, i get jasmine, even tuberose, with notes of coconut and banana (lol). Unfortunately it doesn't really make me think of Egypt, rather of a tropical country close to the beach in the summer. It is very pleasant though, a very sunny perfume, plus tbh the performance is great. The projection is good and it lasts even after a shower.",04/03/25 13:56,laura710
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"super creamy jasmine and amber, although amber isn't even listed in the notes. very faint pink pepper – i have to sniff very hard to get a whiff of it. not for me, but beautifully blended otherwise!",03/25/25 09:21,sofaia
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"Opens up juicy green and aquatic.
I guess it’s the lotus flower. It quickly settles down to a pleasant, sparkly, solar fragrance.
It’s closer to the original EDT than to the recent Nuit edition.
It’s a happy fragrance, slightly aquatic, great for summer and I totally agree - if you liked the original chypre edt but found it too strong - this is a great option to try.",03/20/25 23:56,littlepepperz
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"In dry, cold winter weather: Fresh creamy jasmine with a pinch of sweetness in the opening. Classy and subdued. Getting sweeter as time goes by, at some point the jasmine is a little indolic, or maybe it's just a somewhat weird combination of jasmine and pepper. A bit spicy and dry in the drydown, maintaining the initial creaminess at the same time. Turns into a skin scent after 2,5h.

I like it, but I wish it were more unique. I will give it another go in spring as the dry and cold climate I'm experiencing right now is probably not doing it justice.

Warm spring: It is now far more powerful and very long lasting. It's the same creamy and fresh jasmine, but with a dominating aquatic scent to it that stays until the end. It's still in my hair after 18h.",03/16/25 12:47,Cherryz
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"I like this one. The jasmine is present but balanced through the other notes. It also has something green and fresh. Not nauseating at all, good daytime scent. It definitely takes a step back from generic designer frags and does something more unique.",03/08/25 09:52,Orjen
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"Don’t own this one yet but I just tested it today and it is so beautiful. Very jasmine forward on me, I even was complimented as I walked around the mall.",03/08/25 07:56,Jameelabal
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"Much more better version of Chloe Nomade EDT to my nose. Has the same vibe, but is more fresh and not nauseating. So if you like Nomade EDT, but find it too overpowering, this could be a great alternative.",03/06/25 14:07,frndulinka
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"Actually I got this sample by mistake, I was thinking that I would be getting another Nuit d'Egypte. That is the only one from Nomade flankers that I really enjoy. This one... So green, at the start it was promising, but no, it turns a bit bitter and def green. If I would smell this on someone, I wouldn't think that it is perfume, that I am smelling, but like some herbs or gardening stuff. an easy pass for me.",03/01/25 07:44,Timofejeva
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"I purchased this without sampling, wasn’t really sure what to expect as this flanker seems to be getting some mixed reviews. Well, it arrived today and upon first sniff, I fell in love. It is so beautiful and classy. I actually like this better than Nomade Nuit d’Egypte, which I also have.

This Lumiere flanker is honestly not really similar to Nuit, this is a light, fresh, kinda aquatic, elegant jasmine with some noticeable green notes. (Whereas Nuit is more of a sweet, vaguely spicy orange blossom and vanilla.) Lumiere apparently has the same “spice” backbone as Nuit d’Egypte but I’m not really picking up on it. This will be a perfect spring/summer daytime fragrance.",02/28/25 10:16,booksandcats457
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"I just received the sample in my order, and I think it's pretty alright (not my thing tho)
This one is a super creamy jasmine, it's not completely floral and get a slight green note, and a quite sour one, which is the red pepper. I'm really not a fan of pepper note sadly, but the overall is great.",02/20/25 06:48,Ganii

That being said… Interestingly, this one is very sandalwood-heavy to me which is not my favorite, but does not come off “pickle-y” and blends well with the jasmine. I can’t discern the other notes in this one unfortunately.",02/14/25 15:09,ccwalters
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"Easy to reach for, very calm scent. I can't smell anything particular other than very fresh sparkly jasmine. Very calm version of jasmine with a hint of incense. It will wear nicely this summer.",02/07/25 03:33,Oxidia
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"This is so good! Bright, solar, aquatic, fresh, sweet and summery. I love it :) Perfect for spring and summer. It lifts my mood and I feel like I just wake up in a luxury resort by the french riviera, eating breakfast at the balcony. Sillage is moderate and it lasts on my skin for about 6-7 hours. Chic and elegant :)",02/07/25 02:35,Hannehoney
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"Tried a sample today, this is a jasmine dominant scent but in a sweet and fresh way! Personally I really like floral fragrances that’s why I’m very into all the Chloe releases.

This opens with a very fresh aquatic lotus accord since it’s inspired by the Nile River it smells kinda veggie to me (?) like the one from Hermes Jardin series. It turns into a fruity jasmine in the middle stage kinda reminds me of Nomade EDT (my fav from the line) the pink pepper is missing from the middle notes from what I’ve smelt (some press release mentioned pink berries? Not quite sure which is correct but it smells quite fruity to me)

I think this flanker is a mixture of Nomade edt and the Nuit Egypt the middle stage really reminds a lot of the OG Nomade DNA but when it finally dry down on my skin I can detect the Nuit Egypt dna without the vanilla. It swifts between these two versions from time to time quite interesting! But the sweet fresh a bit vegetal jasmine lingers on my skin for a very very long time. Not sure is it a love but it is a like 👍🏻

EDIT: The more I wear the more I love this version!!!! so so good very fresh and aquatic at the same time, I used to hate lotus note as a very aquatic ingredient but in this it makes it more fresh and calm like other have said I like it very much! Hope this is not a limited edition if yes, I'm gonna buy backups!

Also received compliments twice from friend and co-worker!",01/27/25 05:05,barry1052
Nomade Lumiere d'Egypte Chloé,"It has the same base like ""Nuit d'egypte"", but way more spicier. I personnally don't like it because it has something ""old aunt"" like.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,I kinda thrifted this gem. It’s Chloe signature’s older and wiser sister. The pink pepper note is too prominent at first spray for my liking but it develops as a such a perfect creamy rose scent. Also sillage is hands down the best among the signature line.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"I really wished I had stock up on it when it was still available on the grey market. It's a very special scent that defined my late 20s and grew my interest for other fragrance notes beyond just floral or roses.

If more people had given it a chance to let it develop, you'll find that the initial mature and somewhat ageing rose opening slowly fades away and reveal a warming spiced honey tone. It has some similarity to the original EDP, but the Intense version has more special and exceptional quality to it, that I've yet seen it replicated in other fragrances. It's definitely a scent that wears better during the colder temperature or at night. In hotter climate, I find that it sometimes turns a little acidic on my body.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"I generally at least like every rose scent I test, and Chloe is among my favourite designer perfumers, but unfortunately this is the odd one out in both regards. I think it's the ""intense"" that's the problem, at least for me: the sheer power of this fragrance combined with the extremely botanical character of the rose and the hefty dose of pink pepper make it borderline overpowering to my nose...especially when oversprayed, which is easy to do. It's a shame, because it does dry down to a very nice, luxuruous rose after a couple of hours, still realistic but in a way that's much easier to wear, powdery and subtly sweet. And in that incarnation it sticks around all day - a wonderful fall rose! So if it weren't for that opening I'd be tempted to put this on my wish list, but as it is I don't think I'd ever wear it...I guess I'll have to try to get a sample of the regular version instead!",09/09/19 03:27,dsty

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"Chloé Intense is not really like Chloé Signature EDP. It’s different and quite peppery strong in its opening but settles into a powdery smell which is quite nice. There’s nothing peppery after the initial blast, it’s actually a powdery soapy scent with mildly spicy woody notes.I don’t love it as much as the Original but I like it a lot. Good sillage and lasting power.",01/18/18 20:39,Fleur divina
Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"I got Chloe Intense as part of a bundle (along with L'Eau de Chloe), which I bought because the seller was destashing and selling really low. I normally dislike rose scents, the old-lady type of roses. Granted, I'm not really familiar with many rose fragrances, but whatever impression I had must have come from an unfortunate encounter with some rose scent of the type I mentioned.

Anyway, I was intrigued enough by Chloe's popularity that I decided to blind buy the bundle (I was getting a third perfume at half price along with it, something I was really keen on blind buying), even though it didn't include the classic Chloe EDP or EDT. I'd read up the notes and reviews here on Fragrantica, and thought they sounded interesting anyway.

Well, in spite of reading up first, I wasn't ready for the opening. Chloe Intense hit me harshly with an initial blast of pepper that almost physically hurt my nose. That was the greatest first impression it made on me when I tried it on my arm. It softened up later, but all I could remember from that time was the pepper. The only reason I didn't really regret getting it was because it was so cheap and came with L'Eau de Chloe (which I discovered I rather liked).

But remembering that it had a softer, less offensive dry down, I decided to use it today. (I would give almost any fragrance I acquire a chance and use it at least a full day or give it several hours' use.) Remembering the intense peppery opening, I applied a bit of Lush All Good Things solid perfume on my inner arms for just a touch of smoky sweetness. Then I sprayed on Chloe Intense.

As I sniffed it more closely and fully this time, I still got a peppery blast, but now I could detect a powdery rose underneath. It was not the old-lady rose I was wary of. It's still a strong opening; I agree with heather.h.weber about avoiding spraying so close to the face when trying it out. I still don't like that part so much, but the dry-down was better. It got smoother and woodier, and I found it quite soapy and clean.

However, while pleasant enough for me, it is still not really my type of scent. I could wear it occasionally, but I can't imagine reaching for this nearly as much as my other perfumes. It still isn't the rose for me.",01/16/18 02:53,cherelune
Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"Initially I fell in love with the powdery element of this perfume and loved it. How wrong I was. After wearing a few times I found it hung around like an unwanted ex boyfriend. It began to feel so sickly, heady and uncomfortable. It lingered on me and my clothes, and everything I touched long after scrubbing myself in the shower. No, I did not over spray this, I only used a little. I soon found it unbearable and sold it on to someone who would appreciate it. Another thing to mention is that the lovely silver part of the bottle went tarnished in the end, so it is not something you can leave out on your dresser. Way too heavy and smothering for me.",06/12/17 06:49,FrancesAnne

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"I don't have chloe edp,so I can't make a comparison between these two
Chloe intense is a must have for all lovers of classic rose fragrances,it doesn't have dozens of notes as most of classics do but it has a complexity and class that brings a classic to mind
It's a heavy,heady rose,not a fresh and delicate one,it's mature,bold,almost dark and kind of old-fashioned rose blended with great amount of pepper,it's so peppery that makes my nose tinkle..I can't detect too much sandal or Tonka but for sure this peppery rose,lays on a strong,bittersweet woodsy base..as time passes there is less pepper and more balmy rose,which dries down to a quiet,soapy rose at the end
I don't know what's my feeling about it,I find it seductive and I love it's classic elegance but I find it too mature for me..it's not something I wear often but rarely I reach for it and love it,it's very charming in cold temperature and is definitely a winter scent for me
Longevity and sillage are amazing on my skin..just two sprays and it's well projecting even after hours

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"I have the original Chloe EDP (which I adore), and Chloe EDT. On me, there is very little that distinguishes those two; but for longevity (EDP lasts longer, as expected), you wouldn't even be able to tell which one I have on.

Chloe EDP intense, though, I find nearly nothing like the original. I love this one, too.

On me, its rose is neither bouquet nor fresh-cut smelling. More like potpourri. It evolves to sandalwood that smells like the expensive sandalwood soap we used to reserve for guests at home. Then there's that hint of incense that happens to linger in the background.

Strangely, nothing spicy ever comes around to me.

At one point, my husband said it reminds him of a particular baby cologne; my daughter (she's my nose) said another time it reminds her of baby powder on my skin, but not on the card.

So it's potpourri-incense-sandalwood that is easy and fresh enough to remind my family of baby cologne and baby powder. This complexity is what makes me love it.",04/10/16 02:16,tessaeastgate

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"A magnificent perfume. Just stunning. It´s got something SO right in its spiciness that never gets sharp or too peppery. I have and love the original Chloe and first time I tried this Intense version I had imagined it being boring because it lacks litchi, which I adore in the original. Well, if Intense lacks litchi then there is something in the way Chloe treats the rose itself that is absolutely wonderful. Because I smell the kinship to the original, but while that one is brighter, fruitier and colder, this is warmer- but not too much- and certainly balsamic.
Later: According to Chloe, Chloe Intense DOES have litchi! And also... Well these: pink peppercorn, freesia, litchi, pink peony / creamy sandalwood, magnolia, rose petals, lily of the valley / tonka bean, amber, honey, cedar wood. That makes SO much more sense than the few notes listed here! Anyway, its woodiness is lovely and smooth and it lasts and lasts. I actually think I like it even more than the original because it´s just more versatile- Chloe original is more... strict in a strange way. The original is certainly fruitier, but like I said, also colder. Intense is alluringly deep, but never cloying. The rose and cedar... Mmmmmm! Big love for me.

She answered, and I bought my happy bottle immediately. This fragrance is unique, it plays on the skins of every woman differently. I can feel the bitter notes from the previous versions of Chloe, but only in the beginning. Afterwards I smell beautiful amber, deep and cozy, spicy cedar and some kind of flower bouquet.

This is a woman's scent, grown up, deep and slightly sweet. The rose is present throughout but not on its own. The pepper note adds up spiciness that the tonka and sandalwood tame sufficiently alongside the cloud of Beautiful rose! It a scent appropriate for both work and evenings out.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"I usually wait at least few days to write reviews of my new scents so I don't gibber nonsense, but right now I'm too excited not to for my newly obtained Chloe Intense decant!!!

Firstly I don't understand the funeral flower analogy. You wouldn't call a woody fragrance heavy on sandalwood ""smells like coffin"", then why would a floral with heavier Australian sandalwood base smell like funeral? Chloe intense is so beautiful. It's much more grounded than Chloe EDP, but still fizzy with the pink pepper (no table pepper on me at all). I have always been annoyed by the green fruity base other Chloe fragrances in this line have, but in Chloe Intense that is perfectly taken out. It's just warm, a tad bit sweet, a barely burnt kind of rose. Lasts long but doesn't overpower the wearer. I'm 26 and I can wear this perfectly.

How do I compare this to other rose scents I tried in similar fashion? It is less smoky and less sour than Tauer Phi Une Rose de Kandahar, not as jammy like Jo Malone Velvet Rose and Oud, deeper than Chloe EDP without the fruitiness, not as pure rosy (cause of the sandalwood and tonka) compared to SL La Fille de Berlin, and completely different from the dirty Rose Anonyme by Atelier. If you dream about getting a big time complicated rose scent then you really miss the point of Chloe Intense: this is designed to be a warm, clean, and cozy fragrance that follows you from day to night. Simple as that.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"It smells like Chloe laced with lots and lots of pepper. And it smells like ordinary pepper from the dinner table. I will leave it to dry and see what happens.

UPDATE: The pepper fades after about half an hour and you are left with a rose that reminds me of old school beauty products from the 80s (face cream). It's a juicy, jammy, almost edible rose that's a little bit spicy.

I personally like it now that the pepper has gone away. It smells very expensive and makes me feel affluent and glamorous. I will provide a further update once I have worn this all over for one day.

UPDATE: I have now worn it all over for one day and the sillage is moderate along with the lasting power.",03/26/15 04:55,HeavyBeatsUK

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"I’ve tried several Chloes in the past years and, even though most (if not all) of them were very pleasant, I never made my mind about committing to a bottle. When I was offered this in a swap, I thought “well, why not?” and I am really happy I got it.

Chloe Eau de Parfum Intense has, as listed notes: rose, pink pepper, sandalwood and tonka, all of them are notes I like, but in my opinion, the final result is better than the sum of its parts.

It opens with a full blast of rose, which is neither green nor crisp. To my nose, it smells like a rose potpourri. I like rose perfumes in all of its incarnations, but this is one form I had not found so far.

A few minutes into the drydown, the sandalwood and tonka come to play, giving it a slightly smoky and jammy aspect, not quite sweet. Sweet (not sugary) comes later in the drydown, once the pink pepper starts to disappear. From that point on, it remains linear, but in a good way.

The silage is moderate, at least in winter. I did easily 6 spritzes and my husband only commented (positively) on it when I stuck my wrist under his nose. The longevity, on the other hand, is outstanding… 12h +.

The bottle is pretty, classic, but I don’t care about the ribbon. I actually had it turned to the back of the bottle to avoid getting it soaked in perfume each time I spritz.",02/08/15 05:45,Smellyfaerie

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"I quite liked this one at first spray - different from the other two Chloé perfumes ! (EDT and EDP).

Well, this was the impression that I had when I tested it for the first time : I remember the Chloé rose, but it was somehow darker, the pepper was fizzy, and the backdrop was a smooth wood.

So I semi-blind bought just now, several months later. The first spray is true to my memory, a peppery woody rose, a cousin to La Fille de Berlin by Serge Lutens. But within the hour, the pepper and woods evaporate, and leaves the signature Chloé EDP smell for the next 12+ hours...(still counting)

Overall, I still like it - I've always liked the Chloé rose: bright, soapy, leaves a distinct trail. I just never got it because everyone and their teenage daughter has and wears it too. Disappointed that the first unique burst doesn't last, but this will be getting a lot of wear nonetheless - layering and lazy happy tea-and-a-book days.",11/01/14 19:57,eaudemoi

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"I wouldn't normally like any rose fragrances, but I got it ages ago at a time when I was becoming more interested with perfumes. Once a few years back, I sprayed it in a notebook and when you opened the pages (even from feet 6 away) the scent of this mixed with the notebook paper softly wafted through the air. For that reason specifically, this perfume is exceptionally memorable to me. I let the mist fall over all the notebooks I have now, and even the very first notebook I sprayed it in still smells just like Chloe.
The tenacity is ridiculous.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"Absolutely gorgeous! Has the same foundation as Chloe EDP but it's grown up and more sophisticated. Where Chloe EDP hit me hard in the nose with it's white floral effervescence in the opening; Chloe Intense caressed and beckoned me. On paper, Chloe Intense initially is all pepper and Roses but these two just work with my skin and lose all the sharp edges quickly. Act 2 develops into resinous notes that are very, very sexy. This is where Chloe Intense shines. Sadly, it doesn't last long on my skin. 2 hours in and Chloe Intense has dried down to a light, close to the skin musk almost identical to Chloe EDP. Very soapy overall. Great, because 10 hours later I still smell fantastic but I want that initial burst of ""Intense"" to linger a bit longer.

I don't feel like Chloe Intense is rich enough to be solely a cooler weather scent. It's August in Texas and my nose is very particular depending on the weather. That said, Chloe Intense hasn't bothered me in the least. It's simply beautiful and I think it could work for most seasons and day or night.

Projection is not huge. Dies down pretty close within a few minutes. I can get away with 2-3 sprays and not be offensive.
Longevity: it definitely lasts and lasts. Just not the way I want it to.

In spite of a few flaws, I think Chloe Intense is quickly becoming one of my favorites. I can't wait until the weather cools to see how she develops. Also might work well layered with a longer lasting linear rose scent like Jo Malone's Red Roses or Perfumer's Workshop Tea Rose.",08/17/14 20:06,Liebetx

I bought a sample, sprayed it on my wrist, allowing the liquid to dry so as to avoid alcohol-induced anosmia- and breathed it in. Holy resinous roses dying on the bush, Batman! I made my coworker take a whiff -""WHOA,' she said. ""Put that in a cupboard and come back for it in thirty years."" This is not my lovely Chloe's adventurous older sister, it's her great-aunt.

Chole Intense is a fragrance which I wear sparingly because I do not want to run out of it anytime soon.

It is still amazingly beautiful! It surprised me though because, I can smell a lot more in it now than I was ever able to before today. A distinct honey rose vibe is still there (which might be the soapiness that everyone else is smelling), but it no longer smells like rosewater to me like it used to. The pink pepper popped up and enhanced the rose without ever becoming overpowering. Chloe Intense is spicier now and a little more complex, but its still a simple fragrance. The dry down is a soft sandalwood rose blend that is a little balmy.

I might be a little crazy, but this is still a year around favorite of mine. It really matters on how you apply so it does not become too overwhelming. On me its a very soft fragrance it lasts forever on my skin and does not have a big sillage, more of an intimate scent.

Honestly, some of the simplest fragrances are some of the most beautiful. A nose does not always need to be challegd to make a scent interesting. I also did not realize before today that this is the fragrance that the people around me recognize as my scent. If they smell the bottle they think of me. This would make Chole Intense my signature scent and I finally am willing to acknowledge it though it had been hiding in my collection for over a year. Sometimes you just can no longer deny what makes you feel good. <3

I love my Chloe Intense and I am glad my nose appreciates it more now then it has ever before.",07/24/13 14:19,yuugainotenshi

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"Chloe intense is a wonderful soapy peppery rose scent with a very soapy-sandalwood dry down.I agree with Vie_Cafe about how stong this scent can be to the point of suffocation. I agree to try applying to your wrists and maybe lower on your chests before trying around the neck, so close to the face. It can be a bit overpowering.
It is a very very fresh soapy sent, I image lots of rosey peppery suds. I like this fragrace and think is is a wonderful interpretation of a rose fragrance.

I sprayed it on in the shop and loved it, but when i got home i just smelled a sandalwood bomb which gave me a headache. And when i tried it again yesterday, it was the same. I can still smell it on my jacket that i wore that day and it smells great, also on paper it smells great. Just not on me :( :( :( But i really recommend to try it, because when it fits you it's one of the most beautiful scents!",01/12/13 04:31,elsa.jansen.14
Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"I currently have this scent and I really like it. It's very long lasting, because it's still there with me the next day. I don't have to use much, which is good because here it's a pricey scent. The rose is prominent. To me it's a younger rose like Paul Smith's rose, which I like much. Also the powder comes with it, soft and comfortable. In the drydown at the end of the day I can smell something like a light Tova Signature. It's a little soapy, but not in the unpleasant way - and the rose still lingers. I really like this one :-)",01/12/13 03:53,Habanita

I would purchase in that very second.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"A quite invigorating fresh floral, which is an older sister of Chloe EDP, which lasts on the skin and has most of the hallmarks of its predecessors...

I applied 6 heavy sprays

0 - 1 Hour. 1.25 foot of strong projection. I am so easily trapped by the comparison to Chloe EDP; this intense version replaces the over done soapiness of the EDP with little pink pepper tingling spice bombs which may persist longer or shorter for some.. it is more mature than the EDP, perhaps 42- 68, yet who cares about age..

1 Hours -2 hours - 8 inch projection. I realise that the soapiness of the EDP is what makes Chloe EDP that special, I realise now.. This intense version has replaced the soapiness with a more refined and noble spicy mix - with the soul of Chloe intertwined; yet taking away the soapiness removes the alluring magic of Chloe and the dualness of soapiness and fresh floral has gone... What a masterpiece Chloe EDP is...

2 hours - 6 hours. 3 inch projection. So similar now to Chloe EDP

6 hours - 9 hours - 2 inch projection. Linear, keeps going, some trails stretching 8 inches

9 hours - 12 hours. Close to the skin, that wonderful Chloe smell

I love both, but prefer Chloe EDP

Very good",10/17/12 15:52,ChristopherRiley
Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"I guess I've found the ONE. An amazing perfume, just has it all!
People compliment a lot and I often hear that it smells somehow... nostalgic.",09/20/12 15:59,KseniyaApril
Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"Every now and then even commercial perfumery launch highly meaningful perfumes on market not just ridicously expensive pinky fruity candy baskets. And not just overclean, polished florals.
Previous Chloe is just that: a well made, elegant-refined floral with a modern twist. Good job, but not enough for my wild tastes.
Original old Chloe was much wilder in its old-fashioned tuberose kick.
Now I happened to smell this Eau de Parfum Intense while exercising (shelf crawling) and immediately thought: ""Wow! Now this is perfume!""
For reference think that I come from Idylle and L'Instant, Stella and Organza, Montale Ouds and original Poison and much before from long-term relationship with beloved Samsara (pre-reformulation) and Amarige (also old formula)...
So you might guess simple waters are not my style, even if I find them pleasant in summer, preferably old school colognes.
Chloe Eau de Parfum Intense gives me just the right impact I need to feel with perfume: ultra-feminine, strong and vaguely oriental. There is a thin line between intensity and suffocation. I guess that line changes for everyone and in the same person according to changes of life.
Yes, I smell rose here but not as the only core of the blend. I think that sandalwood is what intrigued me. The heart of this composition is about rose-sandalwood-sweet spice. I hardly believe that the listed notes are complete. It seems to me that they represent only the core of scents.
For me this scent is a solid chance of buying a perfume which is both new (too many memories in my old scents) and satisying at the same time.
I managed to have a sample. I see FB purchase...",08/31/12 06:20,Mellyhelly
Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"I do love intense floral scents...but the original Chloe Chloe was somehow hard for me to love. The reformulation was just unbearable. I moved over to Chloe Narcisse and found it better. But it was never love. So when I saw all the positive reviews here for Chloe Eau de Parfum Intense that mentioned ""rose"" I was confused. I love rose scented perfumes! But I don't remember rose being prominent in Chloe.

Then I saw CEdP Intense at Marshall's for a semi-reasonalbe price. My most expensive blind buy...based totally on everyone's reviews. And I have not been steered wrong. This is a lovely scent. It starts with a waft of pink pepper and rose which seems like it will quickly dry down to nothing. But no! I am instead enveloped in a soft yet penetrating cloud of sweet pure rose and spicy pepper that gradually admits a shadowy but persistant sandalwood. And it lasts forever. I am in love.",08/20/12 23:53,ann.sundwall
Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"Amazing. On top of this, I got it for the bargain price of $50 at Marshalls, only to pick up another bottle on clearance for $20 at TJ Maxx... SCORE. I did not care much about the original Chloe Eau de Parfum-- it just smelt WAY too clean for me, if that makes sense. I know clean can be sexy too, but it was so clean that it wasn't very appealing to me. This one on the otherhand is such a joy. It starts with an almost unusually heavy blast of pepper paired with dewy rose in full bloom, at the height of its fragrance. And it continues until the familiar ""soapy""-ness of the original Chloe appears. But because of the lingering pepper notes and balmy-ness of the base notes, it stays interesting. It is a very classic (but not in a grandma kinda way) and ""put-together"" kinda scent. But it has enough edge that you will believe this woman often spends her Saturdays at some private party where the walls are decorated with black velvet.",08/18/12 23:48,"Amour, Michele"

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"The intense version is a completely different thing from the EDP. Gone is the rose bush sprinkled with raindrops amid the green garden.
First, the sillage of Intense is a bit more reserved, or so it seems until it seamlessly deploys its balmy notes. The rose - a powdery deep dark old-fashioned one, enters the stage through a warm veil of pepper. As time goes, the rose becomes quiet and makes place for tonka and I can definitely smell the sandalwood. The pepper persists in a more delicate warm way. There is something very classic and mature about this scent, a bit gothic even. I like it but I prefer by far the freshness of the EDP. I also think they went wrong with the black ribbon - it makes me think of mourning. A dark red one would be much better and still adequate to this dramatic fragrance.",05/07/12 09:34,LuluCoconut
Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"Bought a bottle yesterday --thought sure I'd love it-- and returned it today feeling very disappointed indeed. Wish I'd tried a sample first as this is definitely a ""try before you buy"" fragrance.

Roses and damp wood, that's all my nose perceived. On my skin the rose was too musty & dusty... like a bouquet of dark, dark red roses that's been in the vase for a few days. I like my roses either fresh or sultry and unfortunately, this was neither. The woody notes were too similar to the smell of my garden shed that has a leaky roof so it always smells damp and vaguely moldy -- not a smell I want on my skin.

Reminds me very much of Cabaret by Gres, which didn't work on my skin either.",04/16/12 12:13,weegee
Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"On my skin this is a balmy, sweet, honeysuckle rose. I love all the chloes (edt, edp, intense) but this one is more sensual, at least for me, and puts me in a seductive mood. I find it unbearable to wear in the warmer weather due to its thick and balmy nature but it is suitable for me to wear occasionally in the fall, winter, and cool spring nights.

edit: I love wearing this in warm weather! Warms up nicely on the skin in the heat. Very intoxicating! Can be too heady if overly applied",02/26/12 08:56,hhgallagurl

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"I love this one. It is marvellous, by far one of the best perfumes out there. You cannot compare it to the vast majority of the other so called perfumes selling these days. It is in a different league. This is a perfume and brings the concept back, reminding one of what a good perfume is like, apparently vastly forgotten. You sniff it together with practically any other perfume out there and see the difference. Beautiful scent, and on the top, classy and sophisticated. I do not think you get classier and morre sophisticated than this. Better on a mature woman. I like it much better than Chloe edt or edp. It is quite different, although a variation on the same theme. You can smell Chloe Edp (or edt) in the background, but there is more to it. Pink peppery harsh powdery airy rose scent rises from that background as the atmosphere overlays the ground. This is a piece of art, a really valuable addition to the world, something which surpasses what nature has to offer without the contribution of mankind. But at the same time it is constructed along the lines of classical perfumery and feels like part of it. There is no concession to current trend here, despite th pink pepper, because it does have in this perfume a different character, a much more subttle presence. It is too expensive, although this one is probably one of the few perfumes worth the price it sells for. I would like to know who is the perfumer. Amazing perfume.",11/19/11 05:41,Migalex

I spotted them on duty free as we both had a chance to choose something together.I gave him few options and he choose this one.
Well,I wanted to pleased him and I agreed to Intense. I like them but dont love them. I know if they will go I wont buy them again. This is very modern fragrance,strong and in my opinion not for winter.The rose has been covered with pepper to much and I can not figure it out what I dont like about it.

This is the perfect kind of Rose fragrance and I have thoroughly enjoyed all the 4 Chloe scents that have been released in this gorgeous bottle however though Intense sits at the top of the ladder not only for its strength in character and staying power but the fact that for my nose and my tastes the Rose in this fragrance is not as mute as it is in the original Eau de Parfum. I dont think I'll go into the notes of this fragrance because it is pretty much just Rose and Sandalwood with a thin and warm layer of Pink Pepper in the drydown which gives it a linear sort of quality. However people may feel about this scent I think its a Triumph for the Chloe brand and I think that its unusual representation of the Rose scent is beautifully done. It is quite pricey here in Australia but it is worth every cent.",07/25/11 05:35,The Collection
Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"Beautiful powdery rose, soft and smooth, with a pronounced sandalwood/tonka/powder drydown. It is very long lasting, but the projection is not very good; surely not as good as the edp, which has a longer trace. I have both versions, and I find this one to be actually smoother, while the edp is crispier and has better silage.
They are both beautiful and really, two different interpretation of a rose scent, as opposed to this one being the 'intense' version of the other one. I love them both equally. The rose in both is dominant, yet somehow the edp is more rosy and green, fresher. This is softer, more voluptuous, eluding less energy than the edp, but warmer. Simply put, the edp is a cold scent, the intense is a warm scent.
Slightly spicy, the pepper never comes strong on my skin, the oriental feel of this one comes more from the warmth is gives, probably the sandalwood with a slight vanillic tint.
The bottle is similar, with different color ribbon; the top part is supposed to be coated with real silver, which might explain why it turned really black, just like silver jewelry. It can be easily cleaned and brought back to shine with the same solution used to clean jewelry, diluted with some water. Personally I don't like the ribbon, which I find ugly and getting in the way of the sprayer mechanism.
Overall, for fans of roses like myself, I recommend trying all versions before deciding; the only version I didn't enjoy was the edt; the rose edition is pretty much a copy from the edp. And the intense is a soft powdery creamy rose scent. Excellent!",05/21/11 06:49,Happyme2009
Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"Rose is about the only thing I can smell here. If you love a good rose scent, this would be perfect. The rose is very nicely done, creamy and sensuous.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"OMG, this scent is incredible! I am completely addicted. I sprayed a bit on my wrist the other day thinking in a few hours I'd realize it was nothing special, but the opposite happened. I was sniffing my wrist well into the night and all of the next morning (longevity is outrageous!). I washed my hands very carefully in order to avoid washing the scent off. I finally realized that I needed to take a shower and could not avoid washing it off. I couldn't stand the thought of washing it away forever, so I went out and splurged on a bottle--now I will NEVER be without! Haha!

Imagine the scenario: You are walking home with a fresh, warm baguette on a cold, dark, rainy day. Through the foggy gray haze, a bright and colorful flower shop catches your eye. You walk in and admire the bouquets of freshly cut white roses, with the dew still on them. Later that night, after you and your date finish a romantic dinner, you go back to his place to get cozy by the fire, his nose gently brushing your bare neck....

This is the same scenario that goes through my mind every time I wear it. The strongest note is rose, but it's a fresh, crisp rose, not an old Victorian one. A light dusting of powder gives it a delicate nakedness that makes you want to bear your soul. It's romantic, intriguing, sensual, uninhibited, 100% woman. It's perfect for day and night--and especially for getting intimate!

Until I found Chloe, my favorite rose scent was Ce Soir ou Jamais by Annick Goutal, which is deeper and more traditional. They are both beautiful but very, very different. I think Chloe is a lot more unique, modern, and fresh.

UPDATE: Wore it on a date recently, and I've never had such an amazing reaction. As soon as he caught a whisper of my perfume, he looked like I'd hit him in the face and he could barely manage to ask what perfume I was wearing through his stuttering. There was no rain, no baguette, and no fire...but his nose was most definitely brushing my bare neck! ;)",11/27/10 14:44,AveParfum

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"Chloe Intense, is a stronger yet not so different version of the original Chloe.

If I had to describe the scent, Chloe Intense is an old-fashioned bar of rose scented soap or that refreshing and homely smell of freshly washed linen.

This is a rose scent that has been emulated and ultimately popular for many years. Despite its very feminine and somewhat classic appeal, Chloe Intense cannot seem to capture me or make me fall in love with it.

It has a strange fizzy quality in the opening that actually makes me sneeze. After that momentary allergy, I become almost anosmic to this fragrance. An hour later, once settled, I can smell the prominent soapy rose which doesn't develop much further from this.

Chloe Intense is a pretty, one-sided fragrance, that appears to be too conservative and too lady-like for my personal tastes. I did, however enjoy wearing this fragrance for the duration that it lasted, which was well over six hours. I don't think I'll be re-visiting this one again though.",08/14/10 06:00,missk

It took time for me to admire Chloe EDP. Nice rose and litchi mix. Appealing color theme and bottle itself that I would place in my room even just as accessory.

EDP Intense greeted me with such a rose soap. Not very nice one, but it was gone fast and didn't spoil my impression. Later it develops into rose + pepper and tonka. Quite spicy and mature. Might appeal someone, but I still adore more fragile tenderness of just EDP.",05/13/10 03:44,Trvevil
Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,Hmm.... Quite disappointing...It smells like a Rosy Soap :(,04/01/10 10:24,Fragrance
Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"I loved Chloe EDP, and now discovering Chloe EDP Intense is like be introduced to a much rounder, luxary and still have the original elegance version of the Chloe EDP.

It starts with a burst of clean rose, in a similar manner as the EDP, but the rose is much softer and powdery in a certain way, and reminds me of old luxary rose soap.

Soon I can detect a lot of red pepper, which works really well with the rose and makes the rose even more fresh and elegant. The pink pepper and rose are such a power couple! However, the pink pepper could be a little bit heavy for hot days. So cooler weather will be perfect for letting this perfume bloom.

The dry down is quite woody in a deeper and kinda intoxicating way due to the sandalwood.

It's worth trying if you like Chloe EDP but want more depth. However, be aware of the pink pepper, in this perfume pink pepper goes til the end and somehow personally I find it a little bit 'out' and harsh.",02/15/10 00:37,sofiii

To my nose, it doesn't appear modern at all, seems very old fashioned, somebody who has failed to keep up with times, not in a good-classic sort of way. In the drydown I am only smelling rose and honey (or a very cloying sweet note) and nothing else. Sorry guys, I am sticking to the original Chloe EDP.

Chloé Eau de Parfum Intense Chloé,"I think that story describing latest three Chloe editions (EDT, EDP and Intense) can be named “meet the good, better and the best”. The order of them I leave to each of you to choose.

I have to mention that all three are utterly feminine, classy and tasteful. Basic difference between them is strength and silage, but apart from that their composition is based on same note of finest rose. Women wearing Chloe can be mother, friend, lover, worker, boss and diva. In my opinion they stand in must have section!",12/18/09 13:20,zvoncica
Love Purse Spray Chloé,"I bought this overpriced purse spray today. I had to try it as I have the other three as well. The powdery notes are missing in this one making it smell more like Pull & Bear Phyillis and Love Chloe Intense than regular LOVE Chole EDP.

Yes the body of Love EDP is there with the Orange Blossom and Pink pepper, BUT the powdery notes in the original is what ties the whole thing together giving it that classic, old school, feminine feel.

If you are a collector and have the urge to purchase this and don't want the powdery note, GO FOR IT. Otherwise don't waste your money.",02/23/23 08:54,Jaxie23
Love Purse Spray Chloé,"Judging by the notes listed on Fragrantica, this one is less powdery. Notice that the powdery notes in the base have been removed? So maybe there is a slight difference between this and the original. The accords at the top are different too. This is allegedly fresher, spicier, and vanillic, which I know the original is not.

Herba Mimosa Chloé,"Soft sunlight in a bottle. This one feels like a warm, lazy afternoon in the countryside. Fluffy, powdery mimosa with a green edge that makes it feel fresh and airy not stuffy. It’s tender, calm, and comforting. Like wearing a yellow cashmere sweater under golden skies. Very soothing and sweetly nostalgic.

I can’t say I know what Mimosa smells like, although I do recognise the scent, To me this smells of clean sheets hanging on a washing line, swaying in the summer breeze. This is gorgeous! It’s a clean, almost cotton fresh type of scent. I love it! I can’t fault this collection at all. I’ve been really impressed with most of the Atelier perfumes and have many from this line already. I love them all.",03/14/25 10:25,CaroleAnne81
Herba Mimosa Chloé,"So pure and refined. A true pleasure for the senses. Almost whispy and airy like. Doesn't turn musty/dusty as many mimosa fragrances do for me.

Herba Mimosa Chloé,"A whispering scent! This mimosa is especially delicate and airy as most other Atelier des Fleurs fragrances are, like brushing past a cluster of mimosa blossoms on a breezy day. The yellow powderiness is the star here, soft with just the faintest fruity sweetness weaving through. Leaning into a mellow, almost powdered-egg-yolk-like blurriness, this is like no other mimosa fragrance—take for example fresher, watery take of something like Amouage’s Love Mimosa. Chloe's is especially light, almost translucent, and you can just imagine the sensation of rubbing fine pollen between your fingertips—the soft texture, the subtle floral aroma, the bare butteriness. A truly gentle, nostalgic take on mimosa.",01/26/25 05:34,luvoxlixir
Herba Mimosa Chloé,"This perfume evoked an emotional reaction in me I rarely get from most fragrances. I do get an herbaceous, stemmy green and fresh quality that instantly gave me an image of walking through a forest path lined with flowers. It was beautiful and nostalgic.

Perfectly balanced powderiness and freshness, no cologne wateriness. And so long-lasting! Excellent performance. Very natural sounding - what's the catch? There is no catch, pure perfume magic.
I've been looking for real mimosa for a long time and gave up. And then I accidentally found it, the very one, these fluffy yellow balls) However, on my skin it is still more floral than green-herbaceous. I think it should also be good for layering.
And yes, I wear this right away in winter - it turns out great)",12/05/24 12:49,Jane Winds
Herba Mimosa Chloé,"This was a rather pleasant surprise whilst browsing Chloè perfumes at Selfridges.

In the midst of the chaotic perfume entrance room (really, Selfridges, Xerzoff at the entrance?) this was instead a gentle greeting.

Soft, light, and creamy with commendable sillage. While this doesn't scream 'main character' it says 'let me take care of this for you'.

This is by far my favourite of this series following their Narcisus one. If you prefer a lactonic mimosa over green/acidic mimosa this is for you.

An easy gift option, as it is inoffensive and I would suggest to any age group. All in all a fancy clean body lotion effect that can be worn in all seasons. Chloè produce a 50ml and 150ml options and I will be investing soon.",07/17/24 09:00,Elli LDN

Herba Mimosa Chloé,"This perfume is a mimosa girl's dream! It is very realistic and floral, as well as herbaceous with a hint of powder. I can't smell the wood in this so much, which is great to me, since I'm not a fan of woody perfumes.

It smells like the early spring and just like a mimosa tree forest. It's a very feminine perfume and only slightly sweet, the floral notes taking over in a vigorous burst of yellow floral freshness. This could be worn in summer and fall, too!

It isn't too light or too strong and can be smelt an arm's length away. It also lasts about 4 hours and 45 minutes roughly on my skin. I don't find it too heady or overwhelming and I think you could wear this at work and at daytime events easily, but it isn't a boring scent at all.

It's unique for sure, since a lovely and true solifore mimosa is so rare in perfumery. This definitely has some oomph to it and no one else will smell like you. Certainly not your basic Good Girl or My Way perfume!

9/10 for sure!",04/01/23 22:32,WhiteFlowerPrincess

Somehow I'm lucky because most of the times I'm happy with the result. This one is straight realistic mimosa. A bit sharp and green. Not overly powdery as most mimosa perfumes. The staying power is spectacular for a delicate floral perfume. It's an all occasion, feminine and distinguished perfume. Simple but great. The quality is there and if you like mimosa this is a great perfume.",06/18/22 20:12,annema
Herba Mimosa Chloé,"I like this green iteration of mimosa a lot. It is linear but refined and feminine, not overly powdery, a little bit oily and just right for every day wear IMO. Perfect for when I want to be polite and understated, and I think a natural scent like this stands out in an office or indoor setting even more. I suspect it will be best in cooler weather, but I don't think it will be as heavy as JM Mimosa & Cardamom feels in hot climate.

The flacon also feels very luxe, weighty and elegantly designed. There are no plastic stickers on this bottle; the information is engraved onto the glass which is a detail that contributes to the luxurious quality. I personally think the flacon design reflects the Herba Mimosa jus perfectly. It is display-worthy.",10/11/21 21:17,janevee
Herba Mimosa Chloé,"There is a transluscent and airy quality to the Atelier Des Fleurs series and so, in total Chloe fashion, much heavier or indolic florals are diluted and transformed into an enchanting and gossamer creation of their former selves. In Love Story a heady orange blossom was turned into a spritely and demure, ultra feminine creation while in Atelier Des Fleurs Lavanda a usually medicinal lavender was turned into a charming and ethereal scent. Here, Atelier Des Fleurs Herba Mimosa, is no different. Chloe takes a usually heady and polarizing mimosa note and folds it into this airy, feathery translucency, lightening what is usually a very bold floralcy. The result is a very frilly and petally (as mentioned) sensation, dancing and swirling in airy vibes of delicate femininity like that of the unfurling and whirling of a tulle tutu skirt. It is elegant, dainty and angelic.",04/05/20 00:07,Unfurling Blossoms

Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Chloe Absolue is the deeper, richer, amberier, more vanilla based version of the beloved Choe EDP launched in 2008.

Even though I always appreciate a longer lasting, more potent version of a fragrance, in this case I prefer the original Chloe over Absolue!

While this gains some contrast with the addition of patchouli leaves and vanilla to the rose heart, it loses the ethereal beauty, the addictive smell of fresh, aquatic, pink and white flowers. The Absolue is far more common smelling than the Chloe EDP. Until few years back when litchi become a very popular note in perfumes, Chloe DNA was quite special and different from other rose forward scents.

I love Chloe Absolue for cooler days or nights wear, but nothing will replace for me the magic that Chloe EDP creates every time I wear it. I will forever repurchase the original Chloe but can’t say the same for the Absolue version. Most likely when I finish my current bottle, I will stick to the original Chloe! For me nothing can compare with the way Chloe EDP makes me feel. Pretty, happy, carefree, expensive…",04/22/24 06:08,Maya lilac

I stopped at about 3/4 of the way through my 50ml bottle, both because I didn’t want to use it up and because I felt I had grown past it. Wearing it today though I’m realising it’s maybe the most I’ve appreciated patchouli in a fragrance! I don’t get much vanilla, it’s mainly just rose and patch which I’m surprised how much I still like. Have I grown up too much for it, in the end? Not at all.",10/31/23 05:14,barbieswanlake
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Chloé Absolu de Parfum was the first designer fragrance that I bought so it has a special place in my heart. But i advise anyone who is interested in the brand Chloé to start off with the original EDP. I loved the EDP from the very first day so I blind-bought the Absolu after reading the reviews, many said that they are very similar.

Now, I totally get the EDP DNA from this perfume. Sure, having both at the same time might be nonessential; however, even for an untrained nose like mine, they did not smell too similar. If you consider the original signature as a spring-summer perfume, you can think Absolu is the fall-spring version of it. The vanilla note might confuse some but it is definitely not sweet, on the contrary, it is still very fresh and much woodier than the EDP. Vanilla adds a deepness, a slight warmth to the perfume. If you don't like the patchouli note, I say stay away from this bottle, because the patchouli is prominent! The rose note is still the main character, though I think it gives off a more mature feel in Absolu.
If you like EDP for the soapy white florals of it, you may not find Absolu very charming. Absolu is still a fresh scent, minus the very-soapy-feel from those white flowers.
EDP is a safer blind buy and a safer gift, but I think Absolu is worth checking out, especially because everyone else also wears the original. Not that it is a bad thing, but if you want that tad of a difference, Absolu is the way to go.",08/24/23 11:29,feliciia
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"As someone who loves rosey perfumes, I was impressed at the clean and sweet projection of rose. It didn't give that familiar scent of ""an old lady's cardboard box of scented letters"" dry down. However, the sweetness of Absolu is a little strong for me. Instead of Vanilla, I'm getting sweet, very ripe Lychee (probably the effect of creamy Vanilla layering with Patchouli). Some people might love that, but it may be a little too much for folks who lean towards black currants and sour berries as supporting notes for florals.

My impression on the transition: Sweet Lychee upon the first spray, and then something very powdery and soapy kicks in, and then BOOM. Blooming sweet roses take over, with Patchouli and a slight hint of creamy Vanilla dancing in the background. Overtime, the rose scent becomes bolder, but without the sweetness leaving. Upon dry down, Patchouli and that soapyness dances alongside the rose, almost as if competing with it now. The finale is a sweet, powdery, and soapy floral which can be overwhelming for some folks who are used to more mature or more simple floral scents... Long story short, try mixing ripe lychee, soap, and roses, but not exactly in a bad way.",05/11/23 13:56,River.c

Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This is a pretty and satisfying rose with adequate and reasonably unobtrusive support. My pithy summary of many reviews and I very much agree. I got it for a song and it's a nice alternative to Perfumer's Workshop Tea Rose and Paul Smith Rose.

It's a beautiful, long-lasting rose. On clothes it is permanent until washing. If I leave a shirt over a chair in a room I can smell it in the room for days.",09/06/22 10:09,Mystères du Château de Dé
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I originally purchased this as a ""work fragrance,"" and I think it can be useful in that context, but it's also more versatile than that.

This is, up front, a very simple but elegant rose. It doesn't feel like a particularly polarizing choice to me, nor is it overpowering in most cases (depending on how much you decide to spray and the size of the room you find yourself in, of course).

The patchouli and vanilla facets of this fragrance are, if anything, supportive elements meant to boost longevity and balance things out -- for the most part, all I perceive is rose. (At times, it can become a powdery rose, but it's more powdery in the sense of ""fresh/clean"" than it is ""vanillic"" or ""patchouli"" in nature.) At the time of purchase (when this first came out), I needed to choose between this version (the Absolu) and the standard Chloe EDP; I sampled both, and this one won, as it felt *slightly* more rose-forward to me (*and* it sounded as though this was going to be some sort of limited-edition scent at the time... obviously, it was not, as it's still around). It can become a *bit* soapy at times (as could the original Chloe EDP), but it never escalated into, ""Oh, my, I can't handle wearing this!"" territory for me.

Are there some people who don't like it? Sure... but there's always someone who doesn't like something, so... go with what suits your situation best.",08/13/22 19:30,Autumn_Moon

Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This definitely has the same DNA as the original Chloe EDP - it's predominately a soapy, feminine rose. The two are so similar that I'm not quite sure if it's worth owning both, but at the same time Absolu has a totally different character than Chloe EDP. It's missing the tart standoffishness of the original and has a warmer, more down-to-earth feeling. The vanilla is faint - it lends warmth to the fragrance but not much sweetness. I normally hate patchouli but it's SO smooth in this fragrance that even I enjoy it. Overall I think Absolu is less unique; has a little less personality than Chloe EDP. It's basically a toned-down Chloe that's better suited to evening wear and cooler weather.",05/02/22 18:52,clairesque
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I love this scent so much. It smells like roses (plural), almost like rose essential oil but more refined and elegant. I think I get some patchouli, and no vanilla, luckily for me. But it's just a background. All I feel is roses and butterflies in my stomach. It is so eternal, romantic and understated. I'm a very practical person but this is one of the few perfumes that induce real emotions in me. It feels very authentic - it is not concerned with trends yet it doesn't try to impress anyone with its novelty.

I like the original, but I couldn't have the same connection as with Absolu. I think Chloe Absolu de Parfum could be the only perfume one owns and it would be great for all occasions and seasons. The quality is very high and the scent is not offensive to general public. If you love true florals (especially roses!) and you don't want to be ""too niche"" with this choice, Absolu de Parfum is a very very nice perfume to have. It is quite intense though, so don't overspray if you are sensitive.

Edit: I agree with MissCee about the opening being intoxicating. I don't know how to explain my feeling other than vertigo, the sense of dizziness when you are in love and don't have much sense of reality. This is really weird, because it's just a smell! A clean, dry smell with nothing resembling food or booze.

Edit 2: After wearing for more than 6 months I understand the drydown more. It remains very rosy, but turns almost metallic. Now I believe that it can be safely worn by men as well because the basis of this scent is a clean bitter floral. I extend my recommendation to basically everybody who doesn't care about labels and marketing. It is a beauty.",04/11/22 05:51,katy-n
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Got this as an unfortunate mistake that I didn’t realize until it was too late. This smells just like patchouli like me. No rose, no vanilla, just patchouli.

Instead I was met with the sweet, juicy scent of this lychee jelly I used to eat as a kid. I did a quick keyword search of the other reviews and found only two people mentioning lychee/litchi so this is a bit strange to me (plus Chloé is popular for their lychee notes so I’m so curious why it’s not on the list). Fruity lychee is cute but would I go for a full bottle of it? No, not really. 😆",11/26/21 20:14,lemonadeblues

Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This was a blind buy and I'm just not too sure about it. I was hoping it would be like my original Chloe EDP with just warmth added from the patchouli and vanilla, but to my nose it's totally different, mostly on the dry down. The opening is similar. The dry down is still very spring like and fresh. I was hoping for something that smelled warm for fall. It also reminds me of Narisco Rodriguez just a little bit. I think that an autumn or warm version of Chloe EPD is the Chloe Sensualle, which I also own, so I think I am sending this Absolu back. I'll wear it again today and see how I feel about it. But I think I just love the original so much, it can't be beat. I may post a review update if I keep it.

Got this one instead as many people say it's very similar, and the addition of vanilla seemed interesting as I am a vanilla lover. I don't have any of the original left for a side by side, but from memory it is extremely similar, but maybe a little deeper with the patchouli in the background. Cant identify any vanilla, really, but it's a great fragrance, and lasts a long time with good sillage!",03/29/21 01:05,lyrily
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This is the only Chloe perfume I own. Initially I almost gave it away because the rose+patchouli combination smells a little bit old-fashioned to me. After trying it for a few times, I can appreciate the demure and feminine quality of this perfume. However, it is not very exciting to me and lacks a bit of character. It is long lasting but pretty linear on me. I use it when I just want to smell nice but am not in any particular mood for my other more exciting scents.

EDIT: the fresh sweet quality of the rose (which reminds me of lychee, but lychee is not listed in its ingredients) comes forward a lot more as the weather gets warmer.

Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Chloe Absolu is gorgeous like the Chloe EDP, same DNA just a little bit of patchouli. Patchouli is my least favorite note, however in this fragrance its not dirty or earthy, its a soft and slightly sweet patchouli.
Original Chloe is one of my all time favorites because of how rosy it is. This one has less rose, still a very much rose perfume dont get me wrong, but not as in your face as the original.
Usually “absolu”, “intense”, “lextrait” versions are tend to be dirtier, but this fragrance is just as clean and soapy as the og. Also despite not being listed in the notes, litchi note is definitely present.
The reason i got a sample of this was because the original doesnt last on me at all, unfortunately same with Absolu. But sillage is better, i’ll give it that. I wont be using this one instead of Chloe EDP but glad im tried this.",03/13/21 01:02,iremis
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I got a sample of this one, and as I expected is definitely not for me.. The listen ingredients are literally only rose and bit of patchouli that only intensify the fragrance. So this perfume is literally rose one, very strong and potent, project good but it has this super strong smell of roses which I very much dislike. If you like roses you wouldn't need more than one spray I feel like, this is how strong it is. But it has this retro roses smelling vibe, if you know what I mean. So this perfume is only for those of you, who like the smell of rose water and rose extract. DO NOT get it if you don't like roses, really. It's not sweet perfume, it's floral only. There is a bit of sweetness still, probably coming from the vanilla, but I can't distinguish vanilla scent per se. It's strong and longlasting one, no doubt. The patchouli I assume make it extra strong. The bottle looks nice. Sadly, not the perfume for me. I can see there is a trend with rose perfumes lately (let's not forget L'ancome Idole which is basically rose scent as well). I can't rate this one as particularly bad, considering roses aren't my thing, but it's too strong for the office imo, if someone around me wear it I might start coughing :D joke aside, but it's true.",02/18/21 00:53,aeanian
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I wanted to have a rose fragrance in my collection. I was close to blind purchasing this perfume and good thing I didn't!
I tried this at store today. I'm a fan of patchouli fragrances. But all I'm getting from Chloé Absolu is a waft of sweet rose. It reminds me of the rose jam we eat in Ramadan in Iran. Smells exactly like the jam. 🙄😐😬
The longevity and sillage is strong tho. If you wanna smell like rose go for it. But this is not for me.

The dry down is very reminiscent of Chloé ‘Love story’ than the original Chloé, probably because both Love story and absolu share a patchouli base. Still prefer the original edp as it’s much soapier and effervescent.",01/29/21 06:40,parfum arthur
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Chloé Absolu de Parfum is a beautiful, feminine, and elegant perfume. It smells chic and expensive. I am a sucker for patchouli and rose and if I was on a distant island and I could take only 2 things with me to make a perfume there, it would certainly be those two notes.

I agree with many of the commenters here, the opening is to die for. But I also love the heart of the perfume- Rose from Grass and Patchouli. This perfume is perfect for fall and winter and I must say, I had a lot of compliments coming from females.

It's a very pleasant scent and I can surely say, that I will buy this again :).",11/20/20 06:19,LavenderJuliette
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"The opening is absolutely intoxicating! I actually crave it, like someone who needs their fix! I'm not usually a fan of patchouli, but this has a very unique smell, softer in a way and (to me) a unique combination. Love the dry-down too. This is a very safe perfume to wear at work and on a daily basis, as it's very soft. I wouldn't really wear this going out in the evenings as ,sadly, I can't really smell it after a short while, so I keep overspraying. I don't know if others can smell me, but I really wished this would last longer, it's quite expensive and if I can't smell it on myself after 30 mins, it means I'll be going through bottles like no tomorrow - which I have, as I find the opening SO incredible - used up several bottles already, I have gone through 50 ml bottles in 2 weeks on average, so I really have to spray a lot to even have a soft sillage and feel like I'm actually wearing a perfume. I really wish Chloè would make a few stronger perfumes from the Signature line, as they are the most gorgeous scents ever. I use the L'eau and the regular Chloè EDP, both have better performance than the Absolu. But since I love the opening so much, I sometimes splurge even though I know I'll go through the bottles quickly!",10/22/20 15:49,MissCee
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"If I was to find myself in a parisian mansion that has been abandoned in the 1920s with nothing having been touched, and I found a 100 y.o. perfume bottle on the dressing table and opened it, I think it would smell like this!

Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Chloé Absolu de Parfum by Chloé was an instant yes for me because I love the original so finding out the made an absolu was exciting for me! I love the pop of the patchouli, it adds a nice spiciness! They keep the original rose DNA which is always gorgeous, it is such a fresh rose. I am forever grateful that the vanilla does not come through with her over-the-top sugary-foody sweetness, that would have killed it for me – I like to smell the roses and Chloé is queen! The vanilla kindly stays in the background rounding out the patchouli from over powering the rose! Beautiful fragrance!",07/28/20 22:23,Addict2Perfume

Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Exactly like a bouquet of roses resting in water after a day or two in the vase. Not at all offensive, but one-dimensional. I like it a lot in the morning, but I am tired of it by mid-afternoon. By evening, I am annoyed it's still relaying the same tired message.

In fairness, it's an honest rose.",06/18/20 19:16,dX1YDip8*kx!
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This scent is L O V E L Y. It has that typical chloe vibe but with a subtle hint of sweetness from the vanilla and the patchouli gives it some depth and some staying power. It reminds me of a luxurious expensive soap in a way... but in a good way. Gorgeous and inoffensive, perfect for everyday wear. The dry down is beautiful.

Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I purchased a sample atomizer of Chloe Absolu after hearing about it on DemiRawling's channel (this was some time ago.) It is beautiful :)

Stunning upgrade on the original Chloe (which I do like.) Retains some freshness of the original, but this is a rose in deep niche style, not too sweet to start - but the sweetness emerges. First, it's fresh and even sour. It keeps deepening into luscious red roses. The vanilla and patchouli bolster the rose, but don't override it. Good pillar rose fragrance, if you need a pure rose. I could see this one becoming a favorite rose for me.

It sits closer to the skin, but when people come close to you, hug you, etc. they will smell it. Four of my girlfriends told me I smelled good when I wore this perfume to a lunch date. Perfect spring fragrance, fresh enough in the sun but sweet enough to withstand those chilly breezes.",03/08/20 13:29,ntabassum92
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Loving the original Chloé EDP I had to try this out.

I don't know if the tester had turned or if it was a very sharp and green patchouli I could smell, but underneath the Chloé DNA was an underlying bitterness that turned me off.

Now, 8 hours later, I can still detect the perfume - the bitterness is gone and all I smell is the well known rose DNA from the original EDP.

I don't get the point with this one.",11/19/19 12:22,Hewlett
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,This is all rose on me. I also get sharp patchouli too. The opening kinda remands me of Narciso Rodriguez fleur musc. Smells expensive but not for my taste.,09/07/19 13:18,Asteria19
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Winter test
Two sprays to inner elbow

I had thought the tester was a bit off, but was told the rep had been in and that one was relatively new.
I got a bit of a tea smell initially, and a sort of clean and dryness.

After about an hour I was wondering what is that powdery make up-y rose ish ness...
Ooo mama, here it is. This scent has the dry cleanness that the original edp had from the middle to the dry down. The rose in this scent is nit fresh at all, it’s like a slightly clean ish soap without being soapy per patchouli is not dirty.

I smell it on the street, in the train, in the grocery store. You get the idea. Chloe Absolu offers me everything I used to love about the original, with a little something different.

Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I like this. Not as much as the original Chloé. The opening is delightful. However, the dry down is lacking cohesion on my skin. Its not as intense as the original on me. It’s a nice fragrance. After using my bottle, I don’t think I will repurchase another .",11/16/18 14:07,Aage
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I don't know why Chloé ply the strange practice of not putting the name of the perfume on the bottle itself. I also have an unfortunate habit of sometimes not fully lodging the name of the perfume in my mind when it's a non-distinctive one such ""Chloe Eau de Parfum"" or ""Chloé Absolu de Parfum"" Now I've got these two bottles of Chloé perfume that are identical in every respect, except that one has a darker-coloured liquid than the other. I got them both within a few months of each other also, so aging ought not to be an issue (I have read that vanilla can darken). Obviously the ultimate test is to spray a sample of one on one hand and the other on the other. So I do this ... and I find very little difference. But then some difference ... I think: possibly most who read this might realise that when the difference is only slight, and you are switching from one hand to the other, your mind can start playing tricks. And then I look them up on here and find that many say there is in fact very little difference between them!

Well I'm fairly convinced that the lighter coloured one, which, judging by the pictures on here is Chloé Eau [dP] is sharper and crisper of aroma - in fact I thought it was actually a bit citrussy, and then a short while later slightly reminiscent of tea, which would actually be consistent with there being lily-of-the-valley in it and not in the other. The other - the darker-coloured one, which would be Chloe Absolu [dP] judging by the pictures on here has that greater warmth that would possibly be consistent with a patchouli note not present in the light-coloured one.

I'm fairly satisfied, then, that I have managed to separate them wider than the spread in my perception due to the noise and the wishfulness - wishing them not to be duplicates - of my imagination. It doesn't help my detective work that clearly they are innately not very different fragrances. But I'm fairly convinced now that the lighter one is Chloé Eau de Parfum and the darker Chloé Absolu de Parfum. The respective colours of the liquid itself match the pictures on here extremely well, and it seems unlikely that manufacturing variations would account for so marked a difference.

As for the fragrance itself: as has been stated often enough now, what can be said about both is about 90% of what can be said about either one separately. These are not my usual kind of fragrance - I tend to go for the heavier stonking kind - but I do like to rock one of these more breezy kinds of fragrance now-&-then. And these are fine examples of that genre: when I was taking deliberate deep draughts of them, they seemed not to have much body ... but the aroma kept intruding with really quite a deal of force as soon as my attention was elsewhere. I think some would say that that's what proper perfume does. And these have that Chloé signature to them: somehow it's the olfactory equivalent of polished marble ... can't say why in detail - they just do do that for me every time. Like in the railway-station lobby described near the beginning of Atlas Shrugged. And I think this would kind of suit Dagny Taggart ... if it were not of course for the fact that she would only wear something fabulously expensive!",10/10/18 09:20,YYY_Delilah
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I'm not sure what to think about this one. It's beautiful and expensive smelling. But it's not quite as good as Chloe edp. The vanilla here in the Absolu sort of clashes with the dewy sparkling roses. It's still a lovely scent but it just is missing that fresh brightness of the original. Bottle is beautiful and elegant, and the perfume has incredible longevity.",09/11/18 12:48,Blushpinkpeonies
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,I want to say that it took me a year as purchasing and trying many different perfumes before I found my signature scent which was Chloe by Chloe. In my opinion that's the most beautiful smell on Earth. I just received this one today in the mail and it is very very close to Chloe by Chloe. It smells a little bit more floral and a little bit less soapy then Chloe by Chloe. If you have one of these you don't need the other really unless you want to have everything that Chloe puts out because he loved it so much like myself. Even a slight deviation from Chloe by Chloe is something I would definitely purchase because of my love for Chloe. This is not only a beautiful smell but it also last a very long time on the skin. I put it on this morning about 10 a.m. and its almost 5 and I can still smell it.,08/03/18 13:44,waskotransportation
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Been wearing Chloe Absolu for 3 days already and I like it. Very strong on the initial spray, it mellows after a few minutes, and the drydown is beautiful. For me, Absolu smells more sophisticated and mature vs its edp and edt version. It's perfect for the cold and rainy weather. I use the edt for hot, humid days.",07/16/18 15:03,marianne76
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This is just like the edp version. I would say that it is for collectors. I love the edp, and thie dry down is quite alike . I can smell a bit more woody note at the beginning, though. Then, it gets soapier, but it always reminds me of chloe edp (2008). I dont smell vanilla, nor patchouli. To me it is quite like the first version, and as I am a big fan, it was worth having this one. If you are a fan of the 2008 version, go for it. Always lovely, delicate and elegant. Not overpowering and suitable for work.


Edit: wore it again on a spring day.... first time it was very cold.
I can definitely smell a woody Chloe edp... ... more creamy and then, I smell a little bit of strawberries!! A tad of patchouli, but soooo discrete! No vanilla, again. But still dries down as the classic edp. I am so glad I bought it!",07/13/18 16:45,ballerina77
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Got this for my girlfriend and she loved it.

She did point out that it reacts a lot to temperature and envirinment. Rose is dominant, it gets boozy at times, and incense-y when sweaty. I kinda like it on her and she does too. It may smell old fashioned, but she doesn’t care. Lasts the whole day.",07/02/18 01:26,Josepavlo

Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"For the second time, I fell in love with Chloe with this perfume. I first smelled the original Chloe Signature Eau de Parfum when I was sixteen, and this even rosier, more powdery, stronger version is even better. I got it for the tenth anniversary and I love the gold-plated bottle and the sparkly golden bow.

To compare, I think the original Chloe is more woody and peppery, and this one is more earthy with patchouli, like the green leaves are still attached to the roses.

I don't think the top of this one will tarnish because it has the gold plating to protect it.",02/07/18 19:45,Chloe Cherie
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"This smells so much like the original EdP but the rose being amped up by a lot. Unfortunately it's a little too strong, almost harsh in a way. I think that must be the patchouli note, though honestly I do not smell actual patchouli in this, and I'm really sensitive to patchouli because I'm not that fond of it.

It's a rich scent, but not exactly warm. I find the original Chloe very warm and sweet and rosy and pretty. This one smells a bit unbalanced to my nose, too top heavy on the Chloe rose note; an overabundantly perfumey-ish floral and not much else to round it out. I honestly don't get any vanilla whatsoever.",11/15/17 19:42,andabri
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Absolu is similar to Chloé EDP yet different if you know the two scents well. Absolu is creamy and rich, earthier and heavier. This perfume has the rose note like the original but stronger and more beautifully blended. The new bit is the patchouli and vanilla ... but I’m unable to detect these notes separately. It is not as sharp as the original at the beginning and has a heavy incense type note, then it dries down to a beautiful scent, similar to the original but lasts much longer. I love Chloé EDP and this being along similar lines, I got a bottle of Absolu too. If u love Chloe EDP, you will want to have this in your collection too as this is a limited edition to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Chloe edp. Even though it’s a very good quality perfume, if you are looking for an entirely new smell from the house of Chloé, this is not really it, it’s along the lines of the original Chloe EDP, a deeper richer version that is more lasting and has very good projection.",11/13/17 19:50,Fleur divina
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"I agree with the former reviewer that it is very much like edp..this is all about rose, I expected more rounded, more creamy..it is a big classy scent, alluring with character...if you love edp, you will enjoy this version, it is heavier, good in winter..
Not my cup of tea though.",11/09/17 13:06,genny17

In my dream it was an extract of the original Chloe edp.
Heavenly!

If this smells like the one in my dream......oh sweet lord.

Who has ever dreamt of a perfume never smelled before in ´reality´?",11/02/17 03:38,Nil3
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"To me hands down this is the best Chloe perfume I have smelled, and I have smelled a handful of them. This is just better blended. This is the Chloe for fall, and winter. I see this as a daytime, and night time perfume, but I still want a Chloe De Nuit perfume. I posted in the forum about this a few days ago, but got no reply to it. To me Absolu is richer than the original which I have never owed a full bottle, because I thought it was too sharp, but now I am going to smell it again, I did have samples in the past. This perfume is buttery, the rose peeks out every now, and again. I really get the vanilla, and patchouli mix, but the patchouli isn't that dirty. I was going to blind buy this perfume, but I didn't I seen bottles pop up on ebay, but apart of me wanted to wait, because of me not liking the original, which that may change, because it's been awhile since I smelled it. I smelled this perfume from the November issue of Harper's Bazaar in the USA, for around two weeks before I decided to buy it. I kept smelling this perfume, and the more I did the more I wanted it, it became addictive. To me, and for me this is the perfect rose perfume, because of how well it's done, it's not too sharp it's just right. Rose perfumes haven't been my favorite, Chloe Absolu has changed my mind. This is also on the powdery side as well, I started thinking a slight cosmetic smell, it's not like the powdery soapy like how Love Story Eau Sensuelle is. I see this perfume as slightly earthy, to me it feels like a older Chloe, maybe on the Vintage side. Most Chloe perfumes I think are that way more from a past time which I like, because I feel like we don't get that enough these days. I will say this is one of my favorite perfumes of 2017.",10/30/17 13:58,lizzyshreds
Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"Went to Sephora last night and tested this on the paper strip.

90% similarity to the Chloe Edp (Which Is My Love) but more earthy due to the patchouli and more warmer by the touch of vanilla.

There something about the rose + patchouli mix that bothers my nose. It turns into a little mild sharp and that never happen to Chloe Edp Which why I Love Chloe Edp more.

I was expecting this would have huge, gigantic projection but actually it's not. It's more intimate & sensual I must say.

Longevity was good though.

I will do further review after I buy the full bottle, because I think this review still not complete yet. I have to try it full spray on my chest, at the back of my neck & my lower back spine area.

I do 3 spray practise to all perfumes to achieve the full effect of the perfumes and at the same time to stay balance so that I won't overspray.

Edit On 20/12/2017
Okay i didnt manage to buy big bittle of this however i managed to have it tested on my skin twice from Sephora. I think i know already why im not going to buy this.

Absolu has this patchouli right ? Which means it brings the earthy scent to it, but another big why i dont proceed to get this in 75ml big bottle was because it has sort of herbals hint come along with it.

Unlike the Original EDP which has powdery fresh plus smooth hint of floral sweetness that I truly love and crazy about this absolu is more warm. It is smooth by the time it reach ths basenotes, but the herbal hint and a dash of bitterness is stopping me to get this.",10/27/17 21:21,Matt Abdul

Chloé Absolu de Parfum Chloé,"My local Shoppers Drug Mart already carries this, and I had the pleasure of smelling this and trying it out the other day.

I'm not a huge fan of any of the other Chloe's, but this one is divine! To my nose, it's really not a true floral like the other flankers. This is rich, oh so smooth and buttery, and more of a heady vanilla, slightly leaning toward floral (the rose). It's really beautiful, and incredibly long lasting both on clothes and skin. I also sprayed it on a paper tester and left it on the windowsill in our top floor hallway, and 4 days later I can still smell this halfway up the stairs. Really packs a punch and will not disappoint in the longevity/projection department.

I have a bottle of this gem slightly used (approximately 13 ml) that I want to exchange or sell.

Thank you.

My review for this perfume now. I classify it as bitter perfume. It is rose, rose and rose. A strong, very long lasting rose, accompanied by litchi as a second accord and a faint woody/ambery base for this almost pure essential oil.

Chloé Lisy Chloé,"It is very similar to the Intense with its woodsy smell... but it's a cross between the Original EDP and Intense. The smell is not as dark as the intense but more powdery and sweet but a different kind of sweetness in comparison than the EDP.

The only thing is that I got this without the leather case. Maybe it's a refill for the set but I'm bummed I didn't get with the leather case because it does not have a cap so I don't trust it to put in my purse.",01/15/13 13:43,pbluberry
Chloé Lisy Chloé,"Most similar version to this is definately the Chloé intense. This is supposed to be not only a purse spray version of the perfume but an extrait (for anyone looking for something justifying that price-tag).
For me, this was a blind buy, and I was especially curious, just because all the other Chloé versions left me all very underwhelmed.... I found them all to be too weak and simple so as the perfume to be way to overrated and overpriced. But this version definately is ""intense"" especially compared to its weaker versions. It opens up with a strong burst of bulgarian Rose and this is the strongest note in the composition. Everything else is still there, and its still very Chloé for everyone who loves this scent... i just find it a tad more interesting, special and worth-to-be-worn than the rest of this line. all in all i am very happy with my purchase :)",12/21/11 14:03,UrbanBeautiful

Right now it’s leaning toward cleaning product in a similar way to Replica’s Under the Lemon Tree. I think it’s the herbal note here that’s getting to me.",02/21/25 13:12,LoafyLady

Verbena Chloé,"I blind-bought a 50 ml bottle, hoping it would not be too much like my other verbena scents (all of which I love, but didn't want to duplicate.) Fortunately this is different from the others. It's categorized here as a Citrus, but the Chloé website describes it as an Aromatic, and I concur. There is a distinctly herbal quality especially as the lemony top notes quiet down. This smells like the great outdoors on a warm summer day. A bit lemony, a bit grassy/hay-like (coumarin). Fresh, even a little tart, rather than sweet. I smell a little LOTV in there. It is light -- definitely multiple sprays are called for, including getting some on ones clothes if one wishes to to prolong the lemony top notes. It is subtle and clean-smelling. I find it quite pleasant, and it drew compliments from both my husband and daughter.",07/15/20 12:33,30 Roses
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"I have never tried the OG Love Story. I really, really like this one. It is by no mean groundbreaking or extraordinary, but it is extremely well blended and classy. I often find fragrances with dominant orange flower note to be too screechy, but here it is softened by lovely heliotrope, which makes the scent soft and powdery, gentle, and as a lover of powdery scents, I find it very pleasing. And very delicate, barely noticeable pear in the background makes it slightly creamy too.

Update after wearing it for 24 hours straight: I updated this throughout the day and came to realize that there is one note there that is unpleasant and annoying, a barely noticeable plasticky smelling note. It is light, but once I smelled it, it was all I could focus on. I think it's synthetic musk, kinda vaguely similar to modern musks of Kirke and Erba Pura, just not as strong.",05/16/25 13:41,makinmagic1

Smelled kind of like old tires. I didn’t like it. I had a bottle of Chloe Love Story Eau Sensuelle that i bought last summer in my desk. I decided to combine it with the dried down Khamra Qahwa. Old tire smell gone and now much lighter and yet more complex. Compliments like crazy. I think there was a note in the KQ that wasn’t agreeing with my body chemistry but the two together on me are “chef’s kiss” delicious smelling. Chloe perfumes are favs of mine. I have the original and a few flankers…go to scents in the warm summer months. Great alone or combined with other perfumes.,05/01/25 10:20,kristi.cathcart1
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"I decided to blind buy this due to the reviews. This is like Love Story’s daughter. More fresh, young, and easy to wear. This is a simple, everyday perfume that anyone can wear. I could smell the yuzu, and pear on the opening, and faint floral notes. The scent is close to CK eternity now but with less sweetness, and more floral. This has become one of my fave freshies.",11/03/24 14:14,mklouise24
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"Soft white flowers, powdery and somewhat soapy, but not mature. It’s fresh and a little citrusy, and lovely for spring/summer. Very feminine and pretty, moderate performance.",07/14/24 15:03,Rosiewebber
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"this is a gorgeous elegant floral scent, i have never smelled the OG but I absolutely adore it",04/21/24 13:00,malake
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,A sweet and sophisticated floral scent that will captivate your senses. It reminds me of a love story that is sweeter the second time around. Better than the OG. My absolute fave and my signature scent.,03/05/24 02:26,paupadua
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"This scent doesn't smell like OG lovestory to me at all. That one is all straight up musky orange blossom, this one is much more. It's more soft, sweet, smooth, silky powdery, and more complex without being complicated or stuffy. Sensuelle is correct! I smelled this for the first time in the Dallas Airport a few years ago. I got stuck there because a tornado interrupted my flight home. I was freaking out so I went to sooth myself in the perfume shop. I wandered around until I found this bottle and went straight for it.

This scent on my wrist was a little safety point that I returned to throughout the airport stress to ground myself. It was very comforting.

After I got home I eventually bought a bottle. Since then I've rediscovered it through passing seasons and last night was one of those rediscoveries. I wanted something sensual and comforting and soft, and I remembered this lovely little thing. I slept so well wearing this :)

It opens fresh and clean with sweet bergamot and flowers. It warms on the skin and reveals cozy heliotrope. On me, in the dry down I get mostly those notes and ambery sandalwood. It's all about fresh light warmth. A pink sundress with dappled golden sunlight on bare shoulders. Demure in a sexy but not too serious or try hard way. She's effortless.",02/18/24 16:24,Foxglovefollies
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"This was a love at first sniff! As soon as I put it on, it reminded me of something I'd smelled before--Mugler Alien Eau Sublime! This is a stunning white floral that is slightly fruity with a soft musk. I prefer this to the Mugler, which I used to own, but found the jasmine to be too sweet. The Chloe is a softer, more subtle option, but you still get the solar white floral. This is so beautiful! I haven't tried the original Love Story- so I can't compare. I don't even know how I ended up with a sample of Eau Sensuelle, but I'm so glad I did! It's going on my wishlist.",02/07/24 11:53,Vickalicious
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"I really like this, so much so I bought a full bottle after using my sample for a few days. I didn't expect to like it as when I tested it on paper I thought it was too sharply citric and a bit common, nothing special. But on my skin it is magic. It's a warm, powdery orange blossom with a beautiful soft drydown. The fruits here play only a supporting role and add lightness, they are not loud or individually detectable but keep the fragrance beautifully balanced. I am loving this for Autumn here in the UK and can see it being perfect for Spring too. I'm surprised this isn't more loved and talked about. I find Chloe in general is rather underrated for some reason and I don't understand why. The more I try from this house the more I like.",10/06/23 08:17,LMD
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"my favorite floral perfume! its fresh, sweet, classy, and feminine. work safe perfume, wont give anyone a headache. you really couldn’t go wrong with this one.",08/06/23 09:14,Miumori
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,Such a beauty for spring! Wearing this today and I can smell it while I’m running errands. It’s definitely has a sillage and it does need to be sprayed again after 4 hours but this is so lite and fresh citrus florals. Heliotrope and pear come to the top after the perfume starts to settle. Really enjoying this and this is a very feminine scent but anyone can wear this! I’m so glad I have this in my collection. Highly recommended 10/10. Not sure if this is discontinued?,04/07/23 11:38,AnlisaC
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"Starts out citrusy - waaay too much for my liking. Frankly, it’s off putting. Then about 45 minutes to an hour later, it has finally calmed a tad down. We’re talking just 🤏🏼😆 In the background I can detect some sweet creaminess whispering but unfortunately the citrus is just too loud and noisy. It’s strange, because it’s intimate in that sense of barely having any silage but when I smell my wrist up close it’s loud and pinching my nose.

After six hours I can smell the heliotrope mixed with some wooden notes and the citrus - those notes basically never leave. If it wasn’t for the fact that I wanted to see how this developed, I would’ve scrubbed it off after that first hour.

Yes, it’s a very clean scent but whoooh, it smacks you in the face. It’s a citrusy bomb😂 At least the longevity is great - six hours and still going strong.",03/09/23 05:15,katherina.1
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"A floral-fruity sweet delicate skin scent.
A creamy and soft composition of orange blossom and heliotrope with added freshness from a bit of citrus and pear. Dry-down is musky, woody and comforting.

This scent is not particularly demanding, in my opinion it suits younger women.

Projection and longevity - rather a skinscent, but even though it's an EDP, it lasts about 6-8 hours on me.",01/08/23 11:17,ladyofwinter
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,I used to love this but now it's too powdery for me. I rarely reach for it.,05/23/22 14:15,tiger_eyes_
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"If you don't like lemon, you will not enjoy the opening of this fragrance. Upon first spray, the lemon and yuzu are so strong that I unfortunately develop a headache during the first hour of wear. However, this eventually dries down into a soft, powdery, plasticy, babydoll head-esque aroma that I find completely intoxicating. If it smelled like that from the beginning, it would undoubtedly be a spring staple for me. Sadly, enduring the lemon-induced headache while waiting for it to get to that point will likely keep me from reaching for this one. If you love lemon, feel free to give it a go. Otherwise, stay away if you wish to avoid a migraine.",01/30/22 21:41,bluemoon33
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"This is very, very orange blossom-heavy to my nose. To the point that I smell no other notes. Maybe the heliotrope just a tiny, tiny bit. When it dries down the smell reminds me of hairspray lol. I kind of regret buying this because it is not complex at all. To me it smells so bland compared to the great big world out there as far as perfumes go lol. :(. I agree with the people saying it smells like Alien. It totally does! Even though that one has jasmine, to me in some perfumes orange blossom and jasmine smell similar.",01/07/22 11:09,chicagogirl
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"I get the citrus and white floral accords more than the powder on my skin. The result is a light and airy floral scent that is not too strong or overwhelming, I'd say it's mostly discreet but it's classy. It doesn't have a sexiness vibe for me so I'd wear it more at office. It could be an excellent wedding day perfume as well and has very good duration.",01/06/22 13:27,antoniov
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"Best out of the love story line. Smells like Coco Mademoiselle from $2 shop. Except it’s not for summer. It’s definitely a winter/autumn scent. This is a strong perfume with weak projection. Initial blast of citrus is very sharp, once the citrus dissipates it stays linear for the next 4-6 hours. Sandalwood and orange flower is prominent. I get comments that I smell like fresh linen just out from the washing machine. I’d describe the scent as creamy woody white floral. Simple, “generic”, inoffensive and feminine. Go easy on this because too much of it will suffocate yourself and everyone around you. Not for people who are sensitive to smell. If you like the discontinued Love Chloe you’ll like this. A final note, the EDT is less headache inducing. Better sillage too.
ES>EDT>EDP",12/23/21 06:32,Mche
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"Typically Chloe perfume range (except Nomade), it’s a powdery scent which i love. But this one has a fresh opening and a little bit of sweetness, just a little bit. Office friendly, inoffensive perfume, perfect for daily wear. Simply a love for Chloe Love Story Eau Sensuelle.",12/14/21 05:28,WijayantiKusuma
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,I saw the notes on here and immediately thought that this was the scent I have been looking for. This morning I received it in the mail. I just sprayed a couple of squirts and let it sit on my wrist for a few minutes now and it honestly smells just like My Way by Giorgio Armani. The opening is like a punch in the face of straight lemon juice which eventually settles and the orange blossom surfaces. Chloe Eau Sensuelle and My Way both share the orange blossom and citrus notes along with the woody base. I'm not getting much amber or vanilla (from the heliotrope). I think I prefer My Way and Chloe Eau de Parfum... So disappointing.,09/08/21 07:27,Terahdactyl
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"This is extremely similar to the original Love Story EDP, to the point where I feel owning both might be redundant. Like the original, this is very soapy especially in the opening, like a dryer sheet. But where the original is fruity, Eau Sensuelle is more powdery. And rather than being bright and sunny, it's musky. Love Story is like a crisp cotton sundress dried on the line and Eau Sensuelle is like a well-loved tee fresh out of the dryer. I'm a big lover of both and I don't know how I'd ever decide which one to buy; that said, I feel like Eau Sensuelle would be easier to wear year-round.",08/21/21 17:43,clairesque
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"I like this a lot more than the original Chloe Love Story. It’s sweeter & creamier with a nice, woody dry down. It’s deeper, warmer & less rosy. Great perfume!",08/15/21 17:45,mellyv1973
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"I really like this flanker, way more than the OG and EDT. In the beginning I would almost swear this was an Alien flanker as the Jasmine note is prominent, but dry down turns to a creamy beach like scent that could be a flanker of Tom Ford Soleil Blanc. The dry down makes me love this fragrance, just wish longevity was better. If you like tropical beachy scents that aren't like a big bottle of sunscreen definitely give this one a try.",07/29/21 10:21,Kyndra09
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,Inoffensive powdery smell that makes you feel sweet and clean.The citruses stand out at first and then the orange blossom and the musc come in front and stay till the end but with a little bit synthetic way. Not so pure blended as the other chloes and not something special. I think its a good beditime scent .,05/20/21 22:00,marios2014
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,I just got my purpl lux travel size of this and I swear I smell heavy jasmine very similar to Muglers Alien. Anyone else? Or did they give me Alien by mistake? The labels say Chloe Love Story eau sensuelle. This is the first encounter I've had with this perfume.,04/24/21 18:03,JustRosy
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"It's just...OK. The fragrance doesn't project at all, doesn't last particularly long, is light, floral, perfumey and indistinct. I don't hate it but it's very disappointing for the price.",04/18/21 11:09,DaniBear1121
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"Really light, delicate, clean, citrusy floral. It didn't do much for me! Pretty unoffensive and mass appealing but not something good enough to purchase a full bottle of. It didn't perform well for me either.",03/25/21 06:46,GabrielleeeeeW

Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"This was a blind buy and I found it really disappointing.

It smells powdery and highly synthetic on my skin, and frankly my nose finds the smell offensive. I guess it's just a case of bad chemistry.",12/18/20 02:33,f9.enqvc
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"Blind buy! And I do not regret it! Oh my! This is a *beautiful*, very soft, delicately sensual fragrance! It reminds me of a softer, creamier, milky, sensual, feminine, & girlie version of Tom Ford's Soleil Blanc which I also own. This is pure heaven! This will work beautifully in warm or cool weather - but probably best in warm. This is mildly citrus-like, a little powdery, warm, cashmere-like. Think of a warm hug. The perfect cuddle scent! I wish this came in a large bottle, I would go ahead and get it! I recently purchased the 1.7. (Thought it was 1.0 originally) If you want a soft, and not in your face scent, perfect for any occasion, this is it.

Update: 2 years later I am still in love with this! I have the original Chloe, Love Story EDP, Love Story EDT, Roses De Chloé, and this beauty! I'd say this one is still my top fave of all. When I wear this MEN tell me I smell really good. I am a waitress and it's always complimented by men. There is just something so soft, sensual, cozy, and oh so creamy about this. Spray it and don't smell yourself for about 20 mins..then it's LOVE.",09/22/20 15:25,islandgirlmaranda

Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"YES YES YES!! When I went to the fragrance store to smell some of the Chloe fragrances, this was definitely love at first sniff. I am new with Chloe but this one stood out to me! It is so sensual and lovely, and it still has the Chloe DNA. It also reminded me of Black Opium by YSL... even though I don't own that fragrance. But this one is lovely and I saw that it had the note Yuzu in it.. And I think that's why I love it!! I love Yuzu I have it in my other favorite fragrance as well (Fuyu D'Or by rituals limited edition). It is very nice!",08/31/20 13:18,Supermonipower
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"So I went to the local perfume store nearby to smell some new fragrances. I had a habit of blindbuying all of my fragrances based on the reviews because I recently got into fragrances and at that time it was the beginning of the pandemic. So I looked up some Chloë fragrances, wrote them down and went to smell some. I had a quick smell before I decided to buy a few. Now THIS ONE I immediately fell in love with!! Out of all the Chloë fragrances this one was for sure the love at first sniff. But it somehow reminded me of a fragrance... it reminds me of YSL - Black opium!! It has this kind of a candy scent to it. But it’s not too sweet. But yet it has that Chloë signature vibe: a bit soapy. Burnout of all the Chloë fragrances this was the least soapy scent + nomade. I liked this more than the love story edp.",08/25/20 05:50,Supermonipower
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"Honestly, I think this is a beautiful fragrance. It’s not complicated, but it isn’t overly simplistic either. It’s like a light weight sundress blowing in a warm breeze. Comfortable and refreshing. On me, the orange blossom, pear, passionflower, heliotrope, and musk stand out the most. The citruses are only present in the beginning, leaving the others I listed to bloom and waft. I don’t get much amber or woody notes. Sillage is soft and longevity is a few hours, which exactly what I want on a warm day. It’s made for warm skin! If I were a summer bride, this would be a contender for my bridal fragrance. I would literally bathe myself in it, spray my undergarments, spray my hair and veil, and take this beauty with me down the aisle as I officially celebrated my love story.",07/17/20 13:21,TexasOrangeBlossom
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,I found this one quite interesting.. when I first smelled it I was like whowhowho... to much to much far to much! The the scene settled after 5-10minutes and it turned to a more tolerable version but still something just do not agree with me in this perfume..... reminds me of the amazing car scent we had in our first car but as an adult with not so tolerant nose I don’t really enjoy this type of sweet scents anymore. Would be a great addition to a young adult or a playful teen but I can more relate myself with the original Love Story.,07/17/20 08:55,Naomie
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"This is a dupe for Beautiful Belle Love - though I'm sure this came first. Sadly, it is not at all a spritely, fresh, beautiful floral like the majority of the Chloe fragrances, especially Chloe Love Story. This is not my type of fragrance. For those who like scents like Beautiful Belle & Beautiful Belle Love this is for you! Not my cup of tea. Sad they did a whole 360 from the original Chloe Love Story.",02/27/20 13:18,Unfurling Blossoms
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"The opening is very alcoholic and aggressively citrusy. A second later, i can smell something faintly sweet and it turns into a powdery cítrus fragrance with a hint of orange blossom. Not what i would really call “sensual”. To me, it smells like washing powder. Reminded me of Glow by Jlo. If you like this kind of fragrance, you will like Love Story Eau Sensuelle. To me, it’s unfortunately a dislike.",12/30/19 09:27,raiza1990
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,MY FAVORITE PERFUME EVER.,11/07/19 04:43,kbm1208
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"chloe love story eau sensuelle

first off i would like to tell this house off for being so silly and making so many of its bottles with flankers so damn alike.
s t o p i t.
keep bottles the same but use better labelling or colour them noticibly differently, not just notice with magnifying glass.


ok, eau sensuelle.

rounded
dry like the other chloes are
soap/clean
fruit
maybe woods
gentle scent but 'thick', not 'thin' and light.


i want to try this side by side with original love story, and chloe chloe edp to be sure if i would add this to my fragrances.

loads of the testers i find for this and love story, and the other chloes are more often gone off, so this might be made of more natural ingredients.... keep it in a dark place, more so than your other scents.


EDIT
its been several hours now, this scent changes alot, its quite dry now, with a cardboardy type or paper note. the top notes are gone. i prefer the original chloe edp over this one.",07/14/19 20:19,dglightblue
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"This is not a fragrance I would have ever given much notice if I were left to my own devices, but now that I've tested it because I got a sample by chance, I have to say I like it. It's a very feminine scent, floral in a way that is soft an fresh, and indeed sensual but not in your face about it. Very nice for spring!

At first it smells a bit synthetic in a way that I find quite pleasant, like expensive shampoo or maybe a slight hint of chlorine from someone's skin on a summer day. Then there's this phase in the early heart where it's almost one-note blossom to my nose, a little nutty, unsweet and super realistic, very much like a real blossom (and very unlike neroli is mostly done in perfumes!). This is my favourite part; after about an hour of this it starts to retreat closer to the skin and becomes more conventionally floral with the heliotrope, which is also nicely done, playing a bigger role in the composition.

All in all I'd say you could do a lot worse than this one if you're looking for a good, versatile spring scent at a reasonable price!",04/22/19 02:44,dsty
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"My all-time favorite perfume is Chloe Chloe (both EDT and EDP). I love them so much that my mouth starts watering when I smell them. They are perfect to my nose.

I blind bought this one and could not be more let down. I THINK it may be the heliotrope that I dislike because going through the other notes in this perfume, all of the rest of them are great, but I am not too familiar with Heliotrope. It gives this scent a powdery feel (which I deeply dislike). I like the tart freshness of regular Chloe. This is not what at all and now I have this HUGE bottle. Anyone want to swap?

Now on to try the other two Love Stories. They have to be better than this one.",03/30/19 17:29,waskotransportation

Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"On first spray, this one doesn't impress me. It's loud, rubbery or burnt or something (same opening as D&G pour femme).

BUT - give it about an hour to settle in and it completely transforms into the most beautiful scent! A bit reminiscent of Gap Dream to my nose, but better. Chloe has yet to disappoint me.

I put this on before bed and woke up to it still going strong. That NEVER happens, so I'd say the longevity of this one is great!",10/31/18 05:05,elmccullar
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"Previously had Chloe eau de parfum and Love Story. This one is not as rosy and more orangey which I love. Just bought this today so the real test on longevity is how it lasts throughout tomorrow after morning shower and daily activities. I liked the opening scent and now going on 4 hours later and still smelling it on my wrist and shirt. I truly hope that the fragrance does have substantial longevity. The Chloe eau de parfum worked well for me but the original Love Story only lasted about 2 hours after application.
The fragrance will be perfect for me if it lasts longer than 2hours. I shall see tomorrow.

Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"I was gifted Love Story Eau Sensuelle for Christmas. Trying it during the cold weather I found it sharp, screechy, and it just stung my nose. I tried it again during the cool Spring days of Paris: still screechy. I did not want to give up on this baby! I put it on this morning when the temperature outside was 80°F. There was no sharpness! I could smell it! And it bloomed beautifully. It smells soft and elegant. Almost regal to me, as I find the whole Chloé house to represent what I picture to be a well put together, elegant woman strolling in the sun with a pale pink or white flowy dress dancing in the light breeze.

Try this lovely lady out during the summer! She opens up the best in warmer weather. 8 hours after spraying, though it's been fading, I can still smell it on my wrist.",06/20/18 07:46,rachael.poarch

I think I would have made the subtle differences a little more noticeable. THE SCENT THO! If you like the ""Gain"" the original throws, this one has More of that & I LOVE it! I sprayed this on my right arm, the original on my left. Let it rest a minute, took a whiff. Repeat. Gave it about 5 minutes. YES! That clean Gain detergent smell is better in this version, even on the dry down later, & did last longer on me. Happy for sure!",12/21/17 22:27,Nataliemarie

Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"I don’t use this word often, but this one is stunning. Probably my favourite from Chloe, sometimes before bed I spray a bit on my pillow, maybe because I’m weird or I like the smell or if I ever invited a woman to sleep in my bed that’s what I’d want her to smell like, but that’s not going to happen because I hate the idea of sharing my bed haha",11/23/17 06:55,CB23

Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"This is one that went from a sample to a full bottle on my table. I find it a unique, womanly sweet perfume that mixes beautifully with my skin, so I have a long lasting scent. I spray it on and am enveloped in a purple cloud. I take deep breaths-why does this fragrance remind me of purple? I can small the orange blossom and pear, but then the flowers, the heliotrope and passion flower instantly bloom which must account for it. Together, they make a rich, creamy, scent, joyous and bold, like the big booming flowers of tropical climes. There is no plum, but it reminds me of biting into a fresh-picked, sun-warmed plum on a hot day, juice dripping down your arm. As the fragrance dries down, the intense sweetness fades to something more luxe. The cedar and sandlewood peep out, adding depth, and it's rounded out by amber. At drydown it's just a nice blend, just a beautiful, feminine scent that can be worn most anywhere.

I adore this scent and can smell it on my skin all day. I like most Chloe perfumes, but this one is, so far, my favorite. And the bottles are so beautiful, they are fragrances worthy of those containers.",05/23/17 12:40,Justapixel
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"I've received this one as a present a few days ago, it's my first perfume from the Chloe line. I ADORE the package, cute, feminine and classic, easy to handle.
I think i might like this perfume very much 'cause it's not a scent that i smell every day.
It's a little bit intense but classic and wearable at the same time, i love the mix of lemon, orange blossoms (LOVE orange blossoms), floral and woody notes.
It makes me feel both sexy and comfortable and that's what i really like about it.
For example: when i wear any kind of Poison i feel like it's too intense and heavy for daytime or spring, even the new Edt.
Most of the times i have to choice between a sexy/intense perfume and a fresh perfume.
But i can wear Love story Eau Sensuelle in the morning and feel both sexy and clean.",05/05/17 15:41,antuan
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"Initially a mildly citrus floral quckly fading into heliotrope and a hint of amber. It only lasted about an hour on me and I found it boring. Chloe always disappoints me. At £55 for 50ml, the longevity and sillage are laughable.",04/19/17 13:05,Siv7Stars
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, I feel like the antithesis of the Chloé woman. The notes in this one made me curious though, so I figured I'd ask for it as an extra in a swap since the person was willing to swap multiples.

Love Story EdT was the first perfume I reviewed on here just over a year ago. I had gotten a sample with a cosmetics purchase, and as the fragrance was brand new, I figured I'd share my impressions - maybe someone would benefit from them? Little did I know I'd find writing perfume ""reviews"" (more like blurbs/impressions) to be such a convenient and entertaining way to procrastinate that I have now done so 600+ times in the course of a year... I'm getting sidetracked, sorry.

Love Story Eau Sensuelle is indubitably very much Love Story, closer to the EdP than the EdT, but with the perfumeyness amped up. What do I mean by perfumeyness? It's one of those adjectives that pop up in reviews, usually with a slight negative connotation, and it is very hard to define. I mean, obviously perfume smells like perfume, right?

To me, when something smells perfumey, it is not effortless. It is overworked. It's just too much, but it doesn't have much to do with the strength/sillage - super sheer scents can be just as perfumey as heavy-hitting ones. Perfumeyness is what makes me crinkle my nostrils slightly, not because it's inherently unpleasant, but because it's overdesigned and there's just too much going on.

I can forgive perfumeyness in certain opulent, golden oldies of the 80's, you know, the scents that the ladies of the TV show Dynasty would wear, because they wear their perfumeyness as a badge of honor. D&G Red Cap is another super perfumey perfume in which I appreciate that aspect and it wouldn't be the same without it. In Love Story Eau Sensuelle, however, I find it hard to stomach. Your mileage may vary.",03/28/17 01:35,Madrona
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"A sweetish soft soapy balmy drydown with the usual chloe undernote. A fresh floral scent blended very well with almond/vanilla notes. Balanced and feminine. Nothing overly sweet and not a plain floral. Sensual in a more delicate way, if we want to be accurate. The opening is indeed very citrusy but it reveals its sweet facets fast. Sweet done well. A lovely perfume for young ladies.

Doesn't project much and lasts a fair time on skin and clothes, well it's an EDT, you can expect it not long lasting.",02/24/17 10:22,iamoir
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"This is lovely, both fresh and warm. The orange blossom is bright and sparkling, while the sandalwood adds warmth and depth. It's similar to Donna Karan's Liquid Cashmere in notes and overall impression. Very feminine and perfect for early spring!",02/17/17 10:02,lizardqueen
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,Strange citrus & heliotrope & woody scent. It smells like a blend of notes that should not be blended together. Final effect is just awkward.,02/15/17 06:51,Arlene-Beatrix
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"Third fragrance in Love Story line and I already know, I didn't like the other two.
Unfortunately I don't like this one either. It says orange flower in notes, but I think it's too bitter, smells more like neroli to me.
It's less bitter than the other two love stories though.
I also sense a strong soapy smell, quite soapy.
I feel like those Love stories are getting a little bit better each time, but this one is not enough for me.",01/25/17 06:20,ScarlettX
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"Hats off to Chloe on this one!!!This is such a beautiful scent...pure orange blossom freshness exactly what I have be been searching for...no cloying sweetness unlike elie saab leau coture....sillage was amazing and longevity great,12 hours!!!...adding this to my collection asap",01/18/17 16:16,chillalot
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,A definite departure from the original and I absolutely love it! This is a lovely perfume that wraps you up in cozy warmth surrounding you in a soft cloud of orange blossom and sandalwood goodness. The heliotrope adds a vanilla impression that is further suggested by the sandalwood. A great start to 2017 with this lovely scent!,01/17/17 04:03,EternityFresh
Love Story Eau Sensuelle Chloé,"Here is a very pretty, lovely scent! so perfectly balanced between the juicy orange blossom, a subtle woodsy undertone, and the soft and sweet heliotrophe..Chloe Sensuelle is rounded, warm, longlasting, and smells wonderful on a cold winter day! it has nothing out of place, very french in its simplicity yet quality..utterly feminine, I see myself wearing it lots,. as it is casual,yet noticeable...I can smell it around me...truly beautiful creation
Very much like the EDT, but a warmer version, more fun almost!!",01/03/17 14:36,genny17
Cedrus Chloé,"Funny story. I smelled this on paper and immediately loved it. I kept the paper so I could smell the drydown. About 2 hours in, after the fragrance evolved a bit, I smelled something that I perceived as a bit screechy. I ran straight here and confirmed my suspicion: Quentin Bisch. His signature is very much on this creation. I can handle Cedrus, with its soft aldehydic nature, far better than I can handle any of his rose-scented fragrances, but Bisch's signature is so hard on my nose. It is strong, projects, and is unmistakable, so I prefer the less screechy intense version that he did in collaboration with Louise Turner.",,sabrinaduncan
Cedrus Chloé,"my daily wear for close to three years and i am still as obsessed and mystified by this perfume as i was when i first sampled it.

perfect for every season, it is warm and comforting. it smells like coming home, like the feeling of a long hug from a friend. it evokes something golden to me, like sun-warmed skin in cotton bedsheets, a cosy cottage, inner peace. it is intriguing, inviting and settles into a subtle and elegant scent.

it is quite powdery and lingers beautifully on skin. i find it clings to clothes for days. echoing what others have said about the necessity of overspraying- as this line was made for layering, this requires a heavy hand to shine as a standalone. but there is no better feeling than wrapping yourself up in a mist of Cedrus before leaving the house. it never fails to make me smile when i catch it on myself.",11/10/25 23:59,julesbpt
Cedrus Chloé,"I blind purchased this second-hand because I was almost out of both my 100ml Bal d’Afrique and Wood Sage and Sea Salt and thought this would be an easy reach in the same realm. I do like this, but it’s not a love. I mainly get florals, moss and vetiver. I do not get woody notes. It’s not airy. More densely powdery. TBH, I’m so confused. I get that this is part of the Atelier des Fleurs collection, so I should have expected floral notes, but I did not see any reviews mentioning that. What even are these florals? Wildflowers? I can’t put my finger on it. I don’t dislike it, this is just really not what I expected at all.",11/10/25 06:30,Lkworth22
Cedrus Chloé,"One of the most elegant and beautiful scents I own. Not too woody, just fresh, clean and sophisticated. Never too much. Absolutely signature scent worthy!",11/01/25 14:47,Maike L.C.
Cedrus Chloé,"First what I get, is lemongrass. As if I just sat at Thai restaurant and sniffed Thom Yum. It develops a little later to more green, toilet refreshener alike needle tree scent. The aroma is weirdly divine, yet super weak, i had to spray at least 5 sprays to actually feel anything.
There is not much wood in my opinion. I feel like in a fresh forest, but it comes more from the cold green notes, not from the traditional woodiness.
And yet it is divine. Absolutely universal scent for everyday errands - not offensive, clean and well put together. Though, I hope the new Cedrus intense can offer a stronger presence than this one.",10/24/25 05:47,Piragelis
Cedrus Chloé,"This smells AMAZING, love at first sniff! It’s a very fresh green scent that’s appropriate for any season IMO. The cardamom note in this just makes it more unique. I see people compare to this to Nomade but I don’t think they smell that similar, they’re in the same scent family but Cedrus is more unisex and green. There’s no citrus no in this but I see what people mean when they say they smell citrus, I think it must come from the vetiver note. When I smell this I imagine myself walking in a quiet forest",10/16/25 19:52,moonlightpeach
Cedrus Chloé,"I get citrus from this, and whether that’s from vetiver, not sure. It’s very aromatic, herbal woody perfume. It’s not my preferred profile but I think it is pretty well made.",10/13/25 18:24,saho93
Cedrus Chloé,"We all know that everyone has their own experience of each fragrance. I'm surprised by how little I get from this one. It's a barely-there whisp of clean citrus on me. that I can't smell unless my nose is right next to my wrist. I love woody scents, but nothing of that comes through.",10/07/25 06:16,gothvixen
Cedrus Chloé,"On my body chemistry, this perfume doesn’t smell like Jo Malone Wood Sage & Sea Salt at all. But it’s super similar to Jo Malone Dark Amber & Ginger Lily. Still, Cedrus smells way better… this will always be in my collection. I always get compliments whenever I wear it.",10/03/25 01:33,LailaNFW
Cedrus Chloé,"Finally, Quentin Bisch is not copying himself! For me, this is the best perfume of the year. I enjoy every single second while wearing it—the freshness, the powdery touch. It feels very calming and classy to me. The sillage and longevity don’t quite live up to the high price of the perfume, but at the moment this is my signature scent. I truly love the cardamom in it.",09/30/25 10:41,Esraals
Cedrus Chloé,"Just yes. Clean, fresh, effortless and chic. I understand the comparison to Nomade but this is lighter, brighter and more airy. Love.",09/25/25 16:37,Sirena78
Cedrus Chloé,"This is rich girl vibes. So efortless, so chic, woody, but has a clean quality about it ( not soapy by all means or laundry detergent vibes) clean as in put together. You smell fancy when you wear this, period. Getting a full bottle ASAP! Do not sleep on this!!!❣️❣️❣️",09/11/25 11:30,melimelo87
Cedrus Chloé,"After almost three months, I tried again. On two different occasions.
Unfortunately, it's still the same. It doesn't work at all with my body chemistry. At one point, I even thought my shirts smelled like old moldy laundry, until I remembered that I was wearing Cedrus.
Something happens on my skin (and certain clothing materials) when I wear the perfume. I'm still sad because it smells sooo good on others and the
quality is excellent.
Sad but it is what it is.
I still have at least 8 mL in a black, air tight vaporizer.
If somebody in the EU is interested. Free of course.",09/08/25 01:45,Raupe86
Cedrus Chloé,"Ordered a sample just to see what all the fuss was about and....I LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE!! It's so airy, fresh and woody, I can't stop sniffing myself. It exudes luxury spa vibes. Next purchase for sure!",09/04/25 01:37,Ella7712
Cedrus Chloé,"Cedrus is a comforting earthy woody fragrance. The woody notes aren't harsh and the sandalwood may be contributing to the slight creaminess here. I admire how all these notes are blended so smoothly. When I first read the note breakdown I got worried this would be an overwhelmingly heavy woody earthy smell, especially when I saw the cardamom note, which scarred me in the BDK Gris Charnel for being too spicy. However, Cedrus is light and creamy for a woody fragrance. I even pick up on this soapiness clean to it. As others have mentioned, I agree that this is a great entry fragrance into the woody scent group. It does lean slightly feminine in my opinion, but men could easily wear this too.",08/27/25 22:15,z808
Cedrus Chloé,Why is nobody talking about how similar this is to Wood Sage & Sea Salt? Smells amazing,08/20/25 11:28,vanillabeanshampoo
Cedrus Chloé,"On my skin, this is a very soft interpretation of wood. I get the oak moss and cardamom, and overall it smells rather feminine. It doesn’t make me think about beard shaving nor boxing 😀 it’s good to add depth to a floral perfume, but it can be worn on its own as well. Last for a few hours.",08/18/25 22:28,eva.daisy.88
Cedrus Chloé,"This is a very soft, woody, and slightly *citrus*? scent to my nose. It's a tiny bit powdery in the dry down, but young and fresh still. Very inoffensive, and could be worn by anyone. A perfect office scent. I DEFINITELY see the similarities to Orphéon (which is one of my favorite frags) and think it's 50/50 unisex. Soooo androgenous. The opening might be sliiiightly more masc - but the dry down is gorgeous.",08/18/25 20:40,glass___petals
Cedrus Chloé,"It is a very nice parfume. Soft, woody, dreamy. However, it smells masculine to me. I can’t imagine a woman wearing this. I’m giving this to my boyfriend since I love the scent.",08/06/25 07:36,Alexandramach
Cedrus Chloé,"If you’re looking for a scent that feels like peace in a bottle, Cedrus might just be it. It’s a delicate, fresh, and effortlessly clean fragrance. It doesn’t shout for attention, but it lasts surprisingly long on the skin. While officially woody, I smell something subtly floral and softly powdery that rounds it out, adding a graceful, almost serene quality. A perfect scent for quiet mornings, linen shirts, and clear thoughts.",08/03/25 00:45,StrangeQuark
Cedrus Chloé,"Warm and cold, shiny and earthy, light and deep. I have never met a perfume that became one with me like this one does. Soft woods, but not creamy. Graceful, botanical. Adore this scent forever and ever.",07/29/25 14:57,stardustofasong
Cedrus Chloé,This smells like what Lily van der Woodsen would smell like,07/22/25 18:08,leng.nui
Cedrus Chloé,This is unisex to me. It smells like a luxurious spa amongst the woods on a cold frosty morning.,07/22/25 05:14,Bopha85
Cedrus Chloé,"I love this scent. I went on a deep dive looking for a scent similar to She Wood (Daphné Bugey) and this was one of the recommended perfumes. I ordered samples of 13 different scents and this one stood out immediately as being a peaceful and earthy scent. It's fresh and clean and I may have to order a full bottle- I just need to test out the other samples.

Edit: It is quite weak and I don't smell it after an hour or so.",07/21/25 18:33,mostfoxes
Cedrus Chloé,"I normally prefer scents with low projection and am a fan of many fragrances that people complain are too weak, don’t last long enough, whatever. But this is the first fragrance I’ve bought that I feel is extremely weak and has so little projection that I’m wondering if it was worth it. Immediately after spraying I have to put my nose to my skin to smell it. So it doesn’t really contribute to any mood I’m trying to set for myself. My bottle is 9 months old by the batch code. I’ve experienced several fragrances becoming stronger a year or two after their first spray—if that happens with this fragrance, I’ll report back eventually..

I do like the smell on paper or when I put my nose to my arm. It’s creamy and lemony in the opening. The cedar is light and not in any way sharp. Very unisex. I think very few people would find this objectionable. I just wish I could smell it more!",07/20/25 21:14,starbit
Cedrus Chloé,"Cedrus smells like peace. It’s fresh, woody, and quietly beautiful…like walking through a calm forest at dawn. Nothing loud, nothing flashy. Just a grounding, elegant scent that feels like home to my soul.

What touched me most is the story behind it .. Quentin Bisch, the perfumer, created Cedrus from a childhood memory of his father gifting his mother a bouquet… not of flowers, but of branches. That tenderness lives in this scent. You can feel it.

It also reminds me of my own trip to Banff… the stillness, the air, the sacred hush of nature. Cedrus holds that kind of memory, gentle and deep.

Side note: I noticed a rude comment below from someone who seems to monitor perfume reviews here. It’s sad that I had to delete my original post. Just because I wrote something emotional and heartfelt and used AI for a bit of edit and correction, it was flagged down. I will not tolerate bullying and I’ll keep sharing my scent journey in my voice. Always.

Also writing about perfumes is personal. I edit and polish my thoughts because I care. If that bothers anyone, kindly move along. Fragrantica is a community, not a courtroom.

Cedrus Chloé,"One of the few hype-worthy scents I've tried. Cedrus deserves every breathless rec you've read. Any green, fresh, aqua-floral, light wood devotee should absolutely try this gorgeous perfume. It is so well-blended and ethereal, not overwhelmed by a single note. The opening is definitely a sheer bergamot and a very shimmery, floaty floral that develops rather than fades into a clean cardamom and sun-bleached wood. Scents like Cedrus are more than a list of notes, though. It's a feeling and a moment to me - summery, white linen caught in a breeze, dappled sunlight across a white tablecloth laid with sweet tea in crystal tumblers. Of course, all of these impressions are pretty much useless in terms of scent profiles, but here we are. Cedrus is worth the pretty words! Note - you will overspray and respray, not only because Cedrus is a light one, but because you want to wrap yourself in it over and over again. Something about it calls to mind OG White Linen (from the early '80s) minus the aldehydes. Also feels like Gris Charnel's boho little sister. Regardless, Cedrus is worth every penny.",07/18/25 11:06,jez244
Cedrus Chloé,"Something classic and easy to wear. It’s understated and comfortable. The cardamom note is excellent here, giving a solid ground to its soapy freshness. Somehow reminds me of the pencil shavings, and on the next whiffs it’s vintage. It’s young, transparent and unassuming. An easy reach for every day use.",07/13/25 07:52,tfek
Cedrus Chloé,This oddly reminds me of Blue Talisman when it’s fully dried down. It’s nice!,07/07/25 16:57,vintaqe
Cedrus Chloé,"Wow, this is a gentle, diaphonous veil of a lightweight scent. It is simply beautiful!

Weirdly, the opening on me took on quite a fresh grapefruit / bergamot type note (not listed), but then levels out as a light and slightly spicy (cardamom) cedar. It is a woody, but it is definitely not a linear one, it is infinitely wearable, and totally unisex!

What I will say is that if you want anyone else to smell it you're going to have to overspray! This one really is quiet and understated but, that said, it lasts as a gorgeous skin scent for hours and hours!

100% recommend at least a sample of this, it is totally worth it!",06/27/25 19:05,GrenadeGirl
Cedrus Chloé,"This reminds me of a rich lady in her 40s wearing belted high waisted jeans and a linen blouse. She's wearing all gold jewellery with a messy updo. She looks like money without trying too hard. She's classy and chic but relaxed and comfortable. I know the word 'chic' is thrown around a lot lately but to me, this fragrance IS chic. Effortlessly classy.",06/15/25 23:08,jaimepenney
Cedrus Chloé,"To me, Cedrus is all about cardamom, bergamot, and soft woody notes, gently wrapped in what I’d call ghost-like florals. The cardamom takes center stage—thankfully, I enjoy it, though I’m usually quite picky with this note.

It doesn’t strike me as a “wow” fragrance, but it’s undeniably pleasant, warm, and comforting. Perfect for everyday wear. While it’s marketed as woody, I personally don’t get much of a forest atmosphere from it; it leans more toward a clean and quietly spicy scent, rather than something green or earthy.

The composition feels cozy rather than cold, making it an easy all-season fragrance. The official note list seems incomplete, but Quentin Bisch offers more insight in the promotional video.

Overall, Cedrus is a subtle, cardamom-forward scent that stays close to the skin and radiates understated elegance.",06/14/25 04:16,rylai
Cedrus Chloé,"Hmm. That's a tough one. It smells expensive. It definitely smells high quality. Unfortunately, it doesn't work with my skin. I don't know if it's the cardamom. Strangely enough, I get a lot of citrus. I'm wearing it right now. It also reminds me of Santal 33, not 1 to 1 but like a cousin. Santal also has cardamom in it. I don't like Santal 33. Maybe that's why. However, I have to say that I don't get a dill note with Cedrus. I hope it settles a bit towards creamy. Maybe I need to let it marinate for a few weeks? In any case, I now have a 10 ml test bottle of it which I hope I can still use. Not bad in any way, just not for me apparently, which is a shame because the quality is great.",06/12/25 09:22,Raupe86

Perfect for every day and can be paired with so many other scents.",06/04/25 21:01,AlyssaSchacht
Cedrus Chloé,Damn this is nice! And I think pretty beast mode. The notes sound like they could be pretty masculine but this is feminine leaning unisex and oh so pretty and clean.,06/03/25 08:22,EauDeAimee
Cedrus Chloé,"To me, Cedrus smells clean, fresh, and woody, with a creamy touch. There’s something soft and delicate about it. It’s a simple fragrance that you can wear every day. I do wish the scent had a stronger scenttrail, but maybe that’s also what makes it so easy to wear, it never feels too much.
I bought this during a road trip through Scotland and wore it every day. Now everytime I wear it, it brings back memories of a breathtaking scenery of mountains, lakes, and endless trees.",05/17/25 02:15,Roses&dahlias

Cedrus Chloé,"I am kind of new to predominantly woody fragrances, but this is so lovely. What isn't mentioned in the notes is an underlying slightly sweet creaminess that balances out the woody notes. I suppose that could be from the cardamom, but the sharp aspect of cardamom isn't present as I've experienced with other fragrances. This could easily be someone's signature scent, as it could be worn year round. For an evening out, it could be layered with something else --vanilla, floral, or even something deeper. I ordered the big bottle during the Mother's Day sale at Nordstrom and I am eagerly waiting for it to arrive. I have travel sizes of several of the Atelier des Fleurs fragrances, and the only one I didn't care for is the rose scent. Quentin Bisch certainly created another masterpiece.",05/09/25 07:48,Lesleyswishes

Cedrus Chloé,This is a great offering from Chloe. Perfect perfume for a day when you want to smell classy and fresh . Nothing crisp or dry. It’s like an expensive lotion that smells more like skin than perfume. Lasts a long time if applied heavily and won’t bother anyone. Super pleasant and high quality. Want a bottle asap,04/16/25 23:02,Riri33
Cedrus Chloé,"Same DNA as in Chloe’s Nomade EDP. Not that fruity nor thick, less of a dusty moss note in the dry-down, feels like a calm, clean, airy, sour, woodsy, superior Nomade flanker with a very bright cardamom note in the opening.
I probably don’t need it cause I’ve already have Nomade EDT and Nomade Absolute but I do want to. It will be easier to wear in summer as it doesn’t need moderate in warmth and windy weather to pull it off.
I don’t see any resemblance to Ganymede nor to Bois Imperial though.",03/25/25 14:54,ASunday193
Cedrus Chloé,"This is a more feminine woody perfume. Highly sophisticated and elegant. It does feel a bit better for an older woman, but I still feel comfortable wearing it. It lasts forever but isn't overpowering with silage. Worth a try if you love woody scents, but avoid it if you prefer very sweet/gourmand fragrances.

This wouldn't be out of the question for a man to wear, but it doesn't feel overly masculine.",03/23/25 13:35,lex1
Cedrus Chloé,"One of the best woody floral perfumes ever, Very clean, airy, very molecular, A bit sharp citrus start is changed with deep woody notes that in few hours evolve into luxurious skin care like cream. Think, it is more feminine, very soft and pleasing. Very diffuse, It fills the entire space around you and lasts long in the air. I can feel my own sillage, but at the same time it is not stuffing me. The best on receiving compliments. 10 out of 10. Did not expect it to be soo exciting.

However the perfume is not unique. If you have Genium Painter, you will not be as excited, They are like twins as Ganymede and Bois Imperial. Can it be different as all of them are created by the same master...?",03/23/25 07:47,Perfumysta

Cedrus Chloé,"This was the only scent I was a bit unsure of. I already have Vanilla Planifolia, Ylang Cananga, Magnolia Alba, Jasmine Sambac and Herba Mimosa and actually love every single one of them! Cedrus needed a little time to recover from shipping to reveal its true quality. I spent ages reviewing this only to realise I’d mixed up my samples.

Cedrus is a really nice woody, versatile, all year round scent. Cardamom is a note I struggle with and find nauseating. While I can still detect the cardamom, it’s balanced well with the wood notes making it much easier for me to wear. I also find Cedrus lasts longer than Cedrus Inense.

Cedrus Intense has a gorgeous opening of citrus and woody notes. I love the opening and wish it stayed throughout. What a shame! It’s strange Cardamom listed because I can smell it strongly in the dry down, which makes the intense nauseating and unwearable for me.

So the winner for me is the OG Cedrus. Great on its own or layered with other scent. I’m still undecided if this is full bottle worthy for me personally though.",03/12/25 12:15,CaroleAnne81

Cedrus Chloé,"I tried this at a duty free shop and was pleasantly surprised. It's lasted 12+ hours on me, and I kept getting whiffs of it during the flight (which was very welcomed since someone took off their shoes and the cabin smelled like feet). It smells really nice. It reminds me of wearing pale blue linen, cognac leather loafers, simple gold jewelry. It's very clean, woody, natural-smelling and high end for sure. I smell some of the OG Chloe DNA as well when it dries down--the sort of wet pavement note that is unique to the brand.

8/10, timeless, elegant and clean. Safe blind buy IMO; I can't see this offending anybody. I'd love a little citrus or salt notes to balance out all the woods but I like it enough as is (granted I LOVE woodsy perfume). This smells nothing like D&G Light Blue (which stinks of lysol) and much more refined than Wood Sage & Sea Salt (which smells like air freshener/room spray). If you like chypre or woody scents (Diptyque Orpheon comes to mind) this is an excellent daytime fragrance.

Worth a FB for me honestly. Blind-reach, easy and effortlessly elegant.

Edit: This is my easy ""dumb reach"" fragrance. I'm obsessed with this and I'm so glad I bought it.",01/18/25 18:27,parfumparfan
Cedrus Chloé,"A sunlit morning, a cold porcelain cup, the faint scent of tea mingling with the crisp air of your cedar cabin. This is the scene Cedrus opens with. Each inhale of the fragrance feels like a gentle sip, light and refreshing, the kind that quiets the soul. The clean aroma of outside santalum trees hums softly in the background, steady, while cozy moss bushes warm beneath dappled light. However, as the day stretches on, Cedrus' charm unmistakably begins to wane. It leaves behind a pleasant but unremarkable trace of musky wood — a conversation amongst nature that has faded into polite silence.",01/07/25 04:58,luvoxlixir

I get the same kind of vetiver here that I remember in Bd’A, but it goes in a soapy direction-or should I just say clean, because it’s not a specific soap but rather a sense of soap.

Magnificent in all ways and for Londoners can be sampled at Liberty, Selfridges, and the Chloe boutique.",10/23/24 11:58,Elli LDN
Cedrus Chloé,"I’m writing this after I was complimented because of this perfume.

To be honest, I was going to write this off as something too light for my liking, but maybe I’m going nose blind to it after spraying it. It’s a very delicate woody fragrance that has a tea-like quality to it. Very fresh and gives a clean girl vibe. It also has the same moss that can be found in nomade, and might remind you of this fragrance but they are still different from each other.
It’s a beautiful scent and I remember when I bought it I fell in love with it, but was disappointed with how light it was and how quickly it seemed to disappear after the first spray (within 30 minutes)

However, a girl just stopped me to ask which perfume I was wearing and where she could find it (which is at an airport). I’m pleasantly surprised as it has been a few hours since I sprayed it last. So I guess it’s not as short lived as I thought.",10/23/24 03:07,Jameelabal

Cedrus Chloé,"This is such a nice woody freshie. It leans a tad sweet. The performance isn't great, it goes about 3-4 hours on me, but I don't mind, especially with a daytime freshie like this. Allows me to switch it up easily for evening. I honestly can see this being a year round scent. Great for work environments and airplanes because it sits close to skin. I really enjoy this perfume.",10/21/24 07:10,lma7911
Cedrus Chloé,"This fragrance is awesome. My wife has a bottle and indeed it is divine. It is a clean woody scent with staying power. The sillage is enormous as well. I am surprised the votes do not suggest that. The first time my wife sprayed this fragrance, it stayed in the room for close to 6 hours after she had left. This morning she picked up a dress she sprayed this fragrance on about a week ago and immediately, the whole room smelled like this. That is how good it is. I am thinking of getting a bottle for my self. She actually calls it her ""Rich Auntie"" fragrance.",09/17/24 05:01,maybekwasi
Cedrus Chloé,"I smelled this in a duty-free as well. They were sold out so I settled for a few sprays on my hoodie and a few more sprays on a Chloe card.

This is exceptionally clean. Aromatic, woody and soapy. It smells expensive and unique compared to my other fresh scents. I don’t think I have anything else with cedar in it but this makes me wish I did. Despite being a “clean” scent, it’s strong and lasts forever, similarly to PDM Valaya (though they don’t smell alike).

The Chloe card smelled for 10 days before my full bottle arrived from Chloe and I threw the card out.",08/31/24 16:01,Maleficent's cotton candy
Cedrus Chloé,"I tried this at a duty free shop and was pleasantly surprised. It's lasted 12+ hours on me, and I kept getting whiffs of it during the flight (which was very welcomed since someone took off their shoes and the cabin smelled like feet). It smells really nice. It reminds me of wearing pale blue linen, cognac leather loafers, simple gold jewelry. It's very clean, woody, natural-smelling and high end for sure. I smell some of the OG Chloe DNA as well when it dries down--the sort of wet pavement note that is unique to the brand.

8/10, timeless, elegant and clean. Safe blind buy IMO; I can't see this offending anybody. I'd love a little citrus or salt notes to balance out all the woods but I like it enough as is (granted I LOVE woodsy perfume). This smells nothing like D&G Light Blue (which stinks of lysol) and much more refined than Wood Sage & Sea Salt (which smells like air freshener/room spray). If you like chypre or woody scents (Diptyque Orpheon comes to mind) this is an excellent daytime fragrance.

Worth a FB for me honestly. Blind-reach, easy and effortlessly elegant.",06/09/24 22:54,parfumparfan
Cedrus Chloé,"costco had a good price on this so I blind bought it knowing I like woody, oakmossy scents.
This is a welcome addition to my collection and I know I will wear this a lot. This is lightly citrusy in the opening, maybe bergamot and dried down on me to just a light powdery vetiver and woods skin scent. I think the oak moss gives it some lift, it feels very airy and sheer. It feels cozy and transparent at the same time.
This feels like it could be the scent of a super high end shower gel. it’s clean and light but still woody and earthy.
I would love to layer this with aesop tacit or gris dior to play with with profiles a bit or with wood sage and sea salt to see if we can create some lasting power:)",06/06/24 09:59,Sweatyhitchhiker
Cedrus Chloé,"Cedar and citrus. Fresh, clean, soapy. Lasts for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Smells good on its own or layered. Unisex but leans more masculine. Waste of money.",04/25/24 08:14,jdluvz
Cedrus Chloé,"Beautiful scent with many of my favorite notes. The oakmoss reminds me of the oakmoss in Nomade Absolu, which is another favorite of mine from Chloe. However, it’s much lighter than Nomade, which is a fall scent for me. To my nose, there’s a also a citrus green tea smell that reminds me of The Yulong and EA’s Green Tea. It’s woody, but the sandalwood doesn’t dominate. The vetiver keeps it fresh, but it isn’t earthy like the vetiver in Terre d'Hermès. The addition of cardamom adds a hint of spice, but it’s not as strong as in Gris Charnel. The dry down is my favorite part. It gets better and better as I wear it. I could even call it a hint soapy, but not like a Chanel fragrance.

Absolute love for me and my favorite Chloe Fragrance so far. It could easily be a signature scent for spring through fall and on warmer winter days.

(This is one of the fragrances I get compliments on, which is nice.)

I don’t think it’s similar enough to Light Blue or Wood Sage & Sea Salt in any way that would make it redundant to own. It’s really just in the same category as those scents (an airy, woody scent), but very different to my nose. I own all three and this one is my favorite.

This is full bottle worthy. It’s my go to scent in the warmer months.",04/21/24 17:07,MelissaKS

Cedrus Chloé,Waiting to buy a bottle after sampling. Better version of Jo malone wood sage and sea salt. Beautiful.,03/31/24 05:16,Cherry08
Cedrus Chloé,"Beautiful! Wow! Refreshing, out of the shower everyday scent. Love the amount of vetiver here. It does not overwhelm me like it does in Bal D’afrique. I once smelled someones sillage, and I could tell the fragrance had vetiver. I was absolutely blown away by what that note does in the summer air, in small doses. Although this is called Cedrus, I detect more citruses and vetiver than I do cedar in the opening, which is pretty harsh and masculine to my nose, but it starts to settle within 5 minutes. Within a half hour it almost sweetens up, ever so slightly. This works magically on the skin! The harsh citruses of the opening disappear, and a lovely woody, spicy, vetiver remains, with a very pronounced cardamom note. I decided against keeping this after all, because I just never reached for it!",03/09/24 14:08,Jezeleah
Cedrus Chloé,"This is very clean and airy citrus-woody scent. Great for vacation!
One of my favorite perfume.",02/10/24 23:34,Kulachet_W
Cedrus Chloé,"Firstly, the note pyramid is incomplete. This has a very strong lemony citrus top note that dominates and persists throughout the life of the scent. It’s actually more of a dominant note than any of the other notes. I’m not a bit fan of lemon perfumes because my chemistry makes them smell like cleaning products. I don’t have this issue with bergamot, orange, lime or citrine, just lemon. This is a very clean fresh unisex type lemon cedar scent to me. I don’t get cardamom or anything spicy. It dries down very powdery. It overall reminds me of baby wipes, and smells exactly as such on my skin. From the first sniff I was instantly reminded of D&Gs Light Blue, and I’m still surprised this isn’t a flanker. I keep trying with this one. I love the perfumer and go nuts for his other creations. I was thrilled to score a 5oz for less than $130. This just isn’t a scent profile that works with my chemistry, unfortunately. I don’t really get sandalwood or moss in this, nor am I recognizing any florals. I’m a big fan of the Nomade line and there are no resemblances in Cedrus to the mossy forest vibes of Nomade. This is a lemon woods freshie. Probably best for summer heat.

I’d recommend this for people who enjoy the lemon cedar freshie scent profile of scents like D&G Light Blue, and who don’t want anything sweet/vanilla/amber or anything floral in their scent. Might be enjoyed by the woody molecule simple scent lovers as well. Doesn’t resemble any other QB scents IMO.

Good projection and exceptional longevity.",02/08/24 06:59,wondervalley666
Cedrus Chloé,"The scent is very woody and fresh. I love layering this with Oud and I always get compliments EVERYTIME I wear it. It smells very clean.

Cedrus Chloé,"This is a nice and light, fresh woodsy scent. I was hoping for more cedar, instead I get more vetiver. When I initially sprayed it I thought it reminded me of Chloe and florabotanica, but sheer, stripped down, without the rose. On the dry down I can really smell the iso e super. Similar in vein to JHAG not a perfume, le labo another 13, or glossier you. I definitely prefer Cedrus out of all 3. Compared to JHAG it smells less harsh and astringent. Not as musky as another 13. And, doesn’t have the sharp pepper, powder or iris notes in Glossier you. If you like any of the scents I mentioned then I think this could be a safe blind buy. It’s definitely a scent that I could picture working well in the heat or in an office environment. My roommate says it reminds him of Jean Naté splash, but I don’t see the resemblance. Overall a good everyday scent for when you don’t want to wear something perfumey. Price wise, I got an excellent deal from Costco, $100 for 5oz. But, if it was full price I would skip it since there are so many similar scents out there.",11/25/23 15:23,loliirain
Cedrus Chloé,"The smell of Wood is very gentle and elegant. Cardamom makes it warmer, but very subtle, just enough to be the background for the Wood scent. I think it is a bright and soft unisex scent, more feminine, suitable for those with a gentle, minimalist style.

My grandfather was a perfume collector, I loved playing with his perfume when I was little, and this perfume reminds me A LOT of a scent from one of my grandfather's perfumes. That's why I have mixed feelings about this one.

I honestly don't get the appeal on this. I've had it for 2 months and still don't like it. But I'll try it perhaps 3/6 months after to see if I still feel the same. Will update. I would suggest you try this on the store before committing to a full bottle.",05/26/23 20:18,nanaidx

Cedrus Chloé,"My partner who never comments on my fragrances said I smelled “nice and fresh” when he hugged me. I was mind-blown.
This isn’t a scent to make a strong impression. It’s soft, skin-like, with slight woodsy soapy touches. There’s a transparency to it, almost like a forest fairy glowing in the grey, damp woods. Fresh.
I like it a lot but it’s not my usual scent profile. It’s lovely if you’re into fresh, soapy, woody scents.
Longevity moderate. Sillage is closer to skin.",02/24/23 06:22,zeelenas
Cedrus Chloé,"Don't be fooled by the name. Cedrus does not smell woody, mossy or spicy in the slightest. Instead, it's fresh to the point of being a soapy type of clean. I also get some florals in there but can't make out what I'm picking up. To me this has the DNA of Giulietta by Tocca, along with the same soft performance. I'd recommend anyone check that one out before blind buying this. It's near impossible to find samples of this line!",05/08/22 00:09,Allisonmsmith22
Cedrus Chloé,"I have been a loyal fragrantica reader for many years, and have always longed to write a review for the scent of my dreams. I am thrilled to say I think I’ve found it in Cedrus.

Let me first say that I now have the pickiest nose on earth. Over the years I have come to not be able to tolerate synthetic scents. I wore Pucci Vivara for a decade, and it was the *only* smell for me. I couldn’t imagine anything more beautiful. Electric green and complex and spicy with a youthful zip. People would stop me on the street and ask what perfume I was wearing. It drove men crazy.

Maybe it was a hormone shift, or the bottle turned… no idea, but one day it started repulsing me. What was once my perfect scent now smelled like astringent old lady perfume. And I began my hunt for my new signature scent.

That was in 2017. I have been searching for 5 years! I seriously think I’ve smelled every perfume in hopes that one will stay, but nothing worked. If it smelled good at first, it was powdery in the dry down. If it had the right citrus, it was too immature and lacked complexity. Then I walked into Nordstrom and told my story to the natural fragrances associate. He walked me over to the Chloe Fleurs collection and sprayed me with Cedrus. I fell madly in love on the spot… and to my delight, 4 hours later it got even better. I couldn’t stop smelling myself. I found my scent!

Cedrus is so special. It is equally earthy and elegant. It’s a summer BBQ in Laurel canyon at twilight, and everyone is barefoot. It is unisex but leans slightly feminine… I’ve never smelled feminine woods done better than this. And the fresh, lightly spicy green finish. It is exquisite.",03/28/22 18:15,SophieSniffs
Cedrus Chloé,"My another love from this house. Incredible work. They say devil is in the details and with this fragrance it is very accurate. It's like finest piece of lingerie, soft, hugging, and has enough beauty to embrace the skin. I always loved Chloe for what they create and this collection is truly worth it for me. I par this one with mimosa and neroli and end result is always great.",09/21/21 12:53,katrin.niisuke
Cedrus Chloé,"Just gorgeously fresh, extremely delicate.
It’s almost as-if some beautiful and slightly sweet boards and twigs and grasses and tender flowers were rained on, and this is the little glowy smell they are putting off.

But totally sheer. And that is after making a puddle on my skin.

You can hardly even shop at a current store with all these sheer trends, it’s really hunting for a needle in a haystack.

I wouldn’t buy this any more than I would walk at the grocery store in a sheer nightie with no underwear.",08/16/21 12:28,Stillmagnolia
Narcissus Poeticus Chloé,"I am wearing it today and it is really potent. Projects a lot! To me, this scent is rather a yellow floral.

It is not stunning, but as a lover of soapy scents, it is very lovely. Has more projection than the others perfumes from Atelier I own (Mimosa, Santalum and Cedrus).
It may not be the more unique fragrance, but is very well done.",03/18/25 10:00,Baileys

However, a full 3 days after spraying about 6 times on the proper paper card I stashed in my travel purse, I noticed the most beautiful scent and assumed it was a new conditioner, but smelled my hair...no not it...I smelled my shirt...nope, not that gorgeous sweet flower smell.... then I remember my travel bag. The amazing scent was coming from this card. Gotta buy it now. Next time I travel.",01/13/24 19:10,cocofluff
Narcissus Poeticus Chloé,"This is a Le Labo style deception regarding the name. There is nothing in this to remind me of narcissus or spring florals in general.

Narcissus Poeticus is a white flower blend with jasmine, orange blossom, neroli. The brand somehow paints it out to be very natural but I get that raspy synthetic note in the late dry drown.

I would group this with Guerlain's Nerolia Vetiver and even Prada Paradoxe,",08/18/23 23:25,evarosa
Narcissus Poeticus Chloé,"I swear I get jasmine or light tuberose in the opening then it dissipates. That's the opening. The mid-phase is all about soapy, clean, powdery white floral — close to Santa Maria Novella's style. I find the drydown to be very pleasant, and it reminds me of the drydown of Jo Malone's Tuberose and Angelica, although this one is greener, more powdery, and less sweet.

Smells chic and classy overall, with a nice twist!",07/05/23 15:04,TunyaPe
Narcissus Poeticus Chloé,the dry down is so soapy and pretty.,10/12/22 09:12,Mez0Nez
Narcissus Poeticus Chloé,"I’m still not 100% sure what narcissus smells like, as I’ve never smelt the flower in nature. From what I hear, narcissus can have a really complex scent profile that goes from the white floral heady to the animalic, green or even tobacco like notes. Looking at the variety poeticus, it is said to smell like a mixture of jasmine and hyacinth, and I think I agree. It’s lush floral and a bit green at once.

This is something I very much enjoy as an easy summer/ morning fresh from the shower floral which is indeed soapy but in a lovely way. Not scratchy-green like some roses, not indolic. In my own scent reference memory, this feels a bit vintage smelling, probably because it reminds me of the glorious vintage collection from Grossmith (Hasu no hana/ Phul nana?) which possibly contain a similar natural narcissus note.

Like the other 2 Atelier de Fleur scents I own, it’s very easy on my nose and does not hit me with unpleasant noticeable aroma chemicals, which I am thankful for. I love this!",09/14/22 11:24,Cicely81

Iris Chloé,"One word: gorgeous. Just magnificent in its simplicity. The opening is just that - a pure iris/orris, green, vegetal, slightly buttery. Iris is my all time favorite note by a mile, and I really wanted to smell it by itself, unmixed with anything, and this is exactly what I've been looking for. Unfortunately, this beautiful opening does not last long, maybe 10 minutes? And then you get a base that feels like mostly ambrette with faint hints of iris.",10/04/25 23:32,makinmagic1
Iris Chloé,"I fell in love with this scent in the spring and summer.
First of all, it’s alcohol-free, and when I spray it on my skin, it gives off a scent that reminds me of herbal roots soaked in liquor — almost like a medicinal root-based liqueur.
There’s an earthy undertone at first, followed by a soft powdery trail that lingers on the skin.
It doesn’t last very long on the skin, but there's a faint, pleasant trace that stays close.

On clothes, however, it lasts longer and doesn’t overwhelm in crowded places thanks to its light projection.
It feels clean, subtle, and distinct — yet hard to confuse with any other fragrance.",08/04/25 00:06,Dinhbao1989
Iris Chloé,"I just tested it on skin and while the opening is beautiful and intense, it turned into a nutty skin scent quite fast. It smelled familiar and couldn't put my finger on it. Then, Eureka! - it smells just like the CCC shops in Europe (they sell shoes and have their own shop scent, not for sale). 😅",06/25/25 08:15,gezakolab
Iris Chloé,"I can't believe it's just 'IRIS'.

When I first sprayed it, it reminded me of green herbs like angelica, and then there was a complex scent of sweet iris, ambrette, sandalwood, and tonka.

It feels cool like cardamom, and it's quite unique. I think the complex of various kinds of scents makes up the identity of Chloe Iris.

Chloe's Iris has a unique sweetness that resembles other perfumes that graft iris onto figs or express it with amber.

But it doesn't 'develop', it lasts almost like a first impression. It's not complicated or heavy, it's clean and easy, so I think it can be used in summer too.

A similar image comes to mind to Frederic Malle's l'eau d'hiver (although not quite the same scent).

This is a 'flower iris' that does not smell like roots, dirt, dust, soap or powder.
It's not the ultimate iris I was looking for, but I think it'd be good to use when I'm tired of overpowering fragrances.",06/23/25 07:31,Inaeon

Iris Chloé,"I am surprised not to see any green notes. The green freshness of the opening hides Iris for an hour or so. Smells like flower stems. Then floral Iris comes out in all its beauty, without any baby powder or lotion kind of notes. It's dewy and airy Iris, not powdery or earthy.

Iris Chloé,"Here is a lovely scent if you like a pure iris, don’t mind having to re-spray (or prefer discreet scents that don’t gas other people) and dislike many fixatives used to give iris lasting power. I adore the note of iris, but it’s often accompanied by other notes or aromachemicals I like less.

I would say this is just a clear iris note over a sweet slightly musky base that may be sandalwood with ambrette. Very uncomplicated and short lived, but I really like to spray it when feeling a bit down, unwell or just in need of a comfort undemanding scent. I’ve been using this a lot with my other Chloes, often at home or going to bed.

Really glad Chloe has this line, and hoping it sells as I’m very much in the market for it.",09/14/22 10:24,Cicely81

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Beautiful natural smelling fresh citrusy rose with woodsy undertones. Not too sweet, heavy or powdery. Ideal for those searching for fresh authentic rose scent for spring and summer.

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"A bright citrus rose. I get a lot more grapefruit than litchi. It pulls back just enough from going into laundry detergent quality which is a plus because Chloe as a whole has many fragrances that smell like detergent. Bright, citrus, clean rose. Youthful easy and charmingly feminine.",01/22/24 15:15,LSAUG
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Damask Rose is very gentle, bright and feminine. There is a slight and fresh Grapefruit scent that makes the scent more natural and green.

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Fruity flirty feminine floral. The grapefruit and litchi add a tartness that gives it a spunky little personality. There is a very smooth crisp clean undertone, like a freshly starched and dry cleaned white collar or scotch tape right out of the package, and I think that’s what could possibly read masculine to some, but the tart fruits and the big rose keep it all the way on the feminine side for me. Moderate performance all around. Office safe. An easy reach in spring and summer.",11/12/23 20:20,ljsmith

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"LOVE this one! There’s something about the original Chloé that I don’t like, I find it sour and a little mature smelling on me. This is way more fresh and elegant imo. It kind of reminds me of a less tart and fresher Delina. Soo pretty",07/10/23 06:44,katieaiken

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I received a sample spray vial with my cosmetics' order... and fell in instant love with this scent so much so that I've immediately ordered more from eBay (verified trusted sellers, of course).

This is my first Chloe fragrance, so I didn't know what to expect but, a sample size is meant to give one a general idea of how good/bad, compatible/incompatible with one's skin chemistry, and generally liked or disliked the scent will be. In this case, good, compatible and very much liked.
Feels young and refreshing, too, and seems to lift my spirits whenever I wear it. I normally steer clear from scents with cedar and oakmoss as they seem to get too masculine on me, but, in this case, they seem to be very mild - still there, just not coming through like the wrecking ball.

My daughter, who is not really into perfumes, asked me what I was wearing as it reminded her of something from Hermes line because of the prominent citrus. I do have Hermes Eau Delicate, which I love for spring and summer, and yes, there is a bit of resemblance, but Chloe's citrus does not last nearly as long as Hermes's.
Personally, I love fresh citrusy scents, and the addition of lychee was just what this fragrance needed to soften the citrus without over-sweetening the whole thing like many vanilla based scents seem to do. The rose is delicate and lovely, but definitely there, so this gravitates more to the feminine side.

Longevity and sillage moderate, turning into closer to the skin in about an hour, so perfectly safe for the office.",04/05/23 11:17,jedikitty
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Elegant and innocent.And he does so with ease. Tapping into the natural essence of fresh gapefruit, a tender and sweet rose, this scent also incorporates the freshness of litchi and notes of amber permeate the overall bouquet.
I am also in a spring mood. Wearing Chloé L'Eau Eau as of late–petally rose over a woody notes base. Fruity, but still fresh
Oh, yes….note least it can be worn throughout the whole day.",03/30/23 03:45,Ominni
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Really sharp citrus at first. Then the scent fades from the skin leaving a slightly rosy and powdery scent.

If it had worked on my skin, the scent would have been elegant too.",03/24/23 06:50,Maria19

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"To my nose, it's very similar to the ""Very Good Girl"", since both of them have Litchi+Rose notes. I'm surprised that in the section ""This perfume reminds me of"" there is no votes for VGG as they are so alike. Chloé is more rosy and fresh. Very Good Girl is more sweet.

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This fragrance smells very soapy and “clean”. I don’t smell roses to be honest. I think it smells like fresh laundry. Although it’s not a bad smell, I really like this perfume. The sillage is moderate and the longevity is long lasting.",12/26/22 08:44,inaya26
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"On paper this smells like chloe EDP but with the soapy, ""laundry"" aspect amped up. It smells like the most luxurious dryer sheet ever. But on my skin all I get is oakmoss and citrus with a tinny synthetic floral in the background. So disappointing!",12/06/22 14:14,clairesque
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I am in the hunt for a rose perfume so I started trying out Chloé fragrances. So far, this is my favorite. The original Chloé and l'eau naturelle have a very distinctive note which I cannot point out which I don't enjoy that much on my skin. This one however does not. It's a light dewy mossy rose. I usually don't like litchi, but it blends very smoothly and complements the rose I can't even smell it unless I look for it.
It's not anything ground breaking, but it's youthful, pretty and non offensive (perfect for the office).

If it was a girl it would be a romantic, preppy and put together sociology student who plays classical piano or dances ballet as a hobby. She also takes pictures of flowers for instagram and speaks French.

Edit: I just finished my sample. I could never expect to love so much a scent with litchi, but I absolutely do. It is not sweet, it helps the rose project nicely on my skin. Last few drops of the sample and surprisingly (it's an EDT) still here 6h later. That's it, I'm purchasing.
Edit 2: I got my bottle and I couldn't be happier. After wearing it for 7 hours I realized what I love the most about it: the youthful and feminine combination of rose and magnolia which I find sexy in a romantic way.
Edit 3: it ended up becoming my new signature scent. My 30 ml is 3/4 empty and I just ordered the full bottle. I'd like to add something important. Comparing my first bottle with the sample that I got I realized that depending on the batch you're getting, you will have more of the litchi- rose accord or the magnolia-rose accord. More on this when I open my new 100 ml bottle.
Edit 4: Confirming edit 3. My 100 ml is clearly more rose forward than the sample and my first 30 ml.",10/24/22 00:34,Frantheone
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"So in love with this scent. I had a mini vial of the original Chloe EDP when I was 18; I used it only on special occasions to make it last since I was still a student and working part time. Recently I found this L'eau version in my little bag of samples I've collected over the years, and I've fallen in love with Chloe all over again. Brings me back to when I felt like I could conquer the world. I haven't smelled the original Chloe in a long while, so I can't compare the two too precisely, but from what I remember, L'eau really is a softer version, very rose-y. I also get some fizzy grapefruit, and some magnolia is present too. But mostly what I get is rose. Such a pretty fragrance, light sillage and it lasts about 6 hours on my skin. Unfortunately all the Chloe perfumes I've tried don't like to stick around on my clothes or skin too long, which is what makes me hesitate buying a full bottle. If not, I would always have a full size of this on my shelf. Very versatile, can be worn day or night, any season. Particularly I love this in the winter, it smells so crisp and clean. She gives me a good boost of confidence, which to me is the mark of a very special perfume.",10/16/22 19:00,kittywhiskers
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Managed to snag a 100ML bottle at TJ Maxx for $50. This is one of my all-time favorite florals and I was down to the last few drops in the bottle I already had. It's October, but still warm enough here to wear this.",10/14/22 12:28,Gi5elle.C
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I do not seem to have the same fragrance as all the others are writing about….yet, I have the same bottle, in the same box, with the same colored ribbon, and the same name. Most others use descriptors such as rose, delicate, airy, and feminine. These words to me bring to mind other fragrances in the Chloe lime for sure. That has been my experience with all the other scents from this house. However, this scent smells decidedly masculine. It smells like a man’s cologne and something I don’t like on me. It smells sharp, green, with a ton of oak moss and cedar. If this is rose, it is all stems and thorns. The roses in the other Chloe fragrances I have tried smell to me like what I think of when I think of rose. They smell fresh, airy, sweet (without being cloying). I feel like me in them. This feels like something I would smell like if I wore one of my husband’s shirts after he just dressed sprayed a woody mossy cologne and quickly decided to throw it in the laundry basket and I decided to pick it up and put it on.

I love Chloe EDP, Roses de Chloe, Love Story, Nomade, and Rose Tangerine. This one while not unpleasant is one I do not relate to. It isn’t unpleasant exactly, but it does not feel at all like me or the Chloes I know and love. It does not smell on me at all like most other people experience it on themselves. It just must be my chemistry. Don’t really know. It is a mystery to me.

Update 7/1/2024 well, this bottle sat around in a closet where my husband put it because I suggested it may be good on him. Maybe because he isn’t a fragrance guy, it just sat lonely. I pulled it out and put some on and it is like a whole new fragrance to my nose. This is Chloe. She is a full blooded sister of the others and has come into her own. The rose mixes well with the grapefruit and litchi and has a a sharpness still that is bracing, but no longer smacks me with a masculine punch. She smells pretty darn fresh, lively, with some gentleness if you give her a little time to unwind on your skin. Lovely little tart Rose! Very pretty and surprising.",09/21/22 00:36,RobinJoy

This one is so Classy and dainty I don’t think I’ve ever owned a fragrance like this. It might sound funny but it reminds me of a tea party the scent itself smells like a sweet Rose tea with little pieces of lemon petit fours on the side. It does have the original Chloe DNA but this has more “umph” to it by far. I sprayed it just to test it out and took a shower about 15 minutes later well after I got out of the shower, I could still smell this little, pretty thing on my arm. I think I may have found my signature scent..I adore this one ooh do I wish it came with a lotion.

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I own the original, naturelle, and this one. I have to say I prefer the original for me. I think the addition of the grapefruit adds a sharpness to it that I personally don't like/don't miss from the original, which I find is much smoother. I think the OG is softer and ""fluffier"" (if that makes any sense), this one has a slight citrus peel bitterness to it which makes it a bit more acidic. As for the comments on the slight masculine edge, I totally agree with that but I personally really love that (one of my favourite perfumes is nomad from this house which is very unisex). Overall this perfume is very inoffensive, feminine, and summery.",04/26/22 10:12,LuluBear
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Immediately I could smell grapefruit and litchi, two of my least favorite notes. After those notes mellow out I can smell the soapy rose. This is actually kind of nice, the grapefruit and litchi aren't too bitter or powerful. I think I actually like this more than the original Chloe. I am also getting some Very Good Girl by Carolina Herrera vibes, mostly because of the Litchi and rose combo. This isn't a must have for me, but I'll enjoy my sample.",04/13/22 06:37,realitygreene

I thought it will be so many votes for Hermes in ""This perfume reminds me of"", but there is none?! Do I have a weird senses, or nobody had opportunity to try the both? As soon I empty the Hermes, will purchase this one and hope it performs better. I just adore this grapefruit fresh, yet elegant fragrance. Love, love",04/09/22 14:48,Tussa

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This was a blind buy as I found a good deal. At first I really liked it, although I expected more rose dominant notes. On me it’s very bitter and the grapefruit-oakmoss side is more prominent. I’d prefer if it was the rose note. I would give it a chance and wear it an additional 2-3 times and then probably pass it on. You can definitely smell the OG’s Chloe base but with a lot of bitterness and this edt is not as strong as the OG. Longevity is quite poor on this one, maybe 3h.",04/06/22 05:23,InaDime
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"At first I did not like this at all, but I've grown to love it. When I first smelled it, I was rather taken aback by the oakmoss and cedar in it, which bring a more masculine edge to the scent than I expected from such a feminine bottle. Now I would describe it to smell like freshly cut roses. Accompanying the rose scent there is a sharpness of freshly cut rose stems in it. It is not sweet at all, which I like. The opening is also sharp with citruses, but I cannot really distinguish a grapefruit note from it. The drydown is my favourite part of this scent with its rosy, earthy muskiness.

The lasting power is not that great and the sillage is very moderate, so this is a good scent for work or casual daytime occasions.",04/01/22 03:36,venusbruises
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I have a 5ml bottle of this, and all I smell is grapefruit.",02/28/22 07:41,Yurippe
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"It is a lovely scent! It has a distinct Chloe-feel in it but it is very light. Suitable for a young girl, for very hot days or for days you don't feel like pulling off ""a perfume"".
However if your preferred price point is somewhat lower I suggest getting Paul Smith Rose instead. I love this Chloe bottle but I feel that I mainly paid for the brand.
All in all it is really nice EDT but a bit too expensive for that light scent that needs to be reapplied rather often.

EDIT: After having worn it for a while I must admit this is more nuanced and delicate scent than it appeared at first. The oakmoss makes it more serious and adult. Also the quality of the ingredients is clear. Moreover I actually prefer to wear it during the colder months as the citrus is less overpowering this way.
All in all, it is a versatile fragrance worth the money.",01/05/22 04:39,lesritesdelavie
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Cedar and pale pink dewy roses mingle beautifully. Dries down to a lovely musk with grapefruit dancing around the edges.

I'm not one for rose scents normally, but I find soft elegance within this feminine scent rather than the old-fashioned vibes I often get from rose scents.

A light, pretty counterpoint to my usual vanilla and tuberose leanings. My skin definitely brings out more cedar than the votes here reflect. Good for any time of the year, but particularly spring and summer.",12/22/21 09:10,WendyMH
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Much tolerable than the original
As the name implies (L'eau) notes have been watered down here, so it doesn't have that strong soapy powdery in your face scent u get from the original

While I am a fruity at summer & gourmand sweet at winter kinnda girl
I can still see this wearable at the office , as it has that clean fresh off the shower scent
Also its calming , so can be used at night before bed time

But the original has a more lasting power (I guess because this one is an eau de toilet)

Suitable all year round I would say

Bottle is gorgeous , still has the same classic chic vintage style , u imagne seeing in powder rooms of the olden days",12/22/21 09:10,dovey
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Easily my favorite from the Chloé range! This is so beautiful and well-balanced between the fruitiness/floral aspects and just an all-around pretty scent. The bottle is gorgeous as well... I think I’d definitely recommend this to someone over the OG alone based on how popular the original is. If you’re deciding between this and something similar, go with this!",12/07/21 18:48,missmaddiemac
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I just got this pretty bottle of chloe leau, I love the scent, its very delicate.
The opening is roses de chloe mixed with chloe original, the dry down is a perfect combination between chloe roses and lovestory…
I am not super happy with the projection sillage or longevity. It performs poor overall.
I would love to get a parfum version of this same scent, but doesn’t exist yet.
Again, scent is beautiful, delicate and divine, performance not so much, specially for the high price I paid.
You would need to almost Shower in this fragrance, and still, you and only you will be able to smell the divine scent. No body around will capture the perfume you are wearing. A very expensive body splash.
I kinda disagree with the “season classification” in general. To me, all seasons and temperatures are right for a good perfume. I really dont understand why I should wear this or that in certain temperatures.
This is a floral, fresh scent, so I suppose people identify this with spring and summer. Its December and im wearing it…",12/06/21 19:28,Anitatexas

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Chloe L'eau is happy, light and bright. I love the combination of rose, grapefruit and litchi in the top notes, it's really quite refreshing and ever so slightly sweet. On drydown it gets a little powdery and it has such a cloud of softness that it is really cosy.",11/18/21 15:35,harperpeshhe
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This is such a beautiful and light floral scent! It doesn't give me headaches which is a huge win on my book.

The opening is straight up alcohol for the first few seconds and then you get the bright grapefruit scent mixed with rose and magnolia. It's such a soft and lovely and beautiful floral scent, but it has some complexity to it so it doesn't feel too boring or generic to my nose. I occasionally catch the sweetness of the litchi and it's so delicious, it is definitely more prominent the longer your wear.

The only downside is how light this it (but it is L'eau so I guess that makes sense haha!). After 30 mins it's pretty much fading and I really have to get my nose super close up to smell it. That being said it does stay on the skin pretty well but it doesn't project much after about an hour. This does linger well on clothes though so try that to boost the longevity & projectio ! I sprayed it before hopping into bed and every time I go to bed I still catch whiffs of this and it's so lovely. It has decent sillage for a scent that's so light and fresh, but the longer you wear this the closer it sits to the skin. So if want more scent trails, you probably will need to reapply.

This is a youthful, girly, innocent, fresh and clean scent that reminds me of warm spring nights and sundresses, lunch dates and picnics.

EDIT: After wearing this several times I noticed I still catch whiffs of this on clothing several days later surprisingly.

I also recently tested the original EDP. L'eau is more gentle & sweet whereas the EDP is louder. I much prefer this one as the EDP is a tad cloying",11/05/21 18:42,mangooo

A clean hospital floor. ( I think its the oakmoss)

Its not medicinal....its not a dentist praxis, its....... a clean hospital floor or even room ready to be taken over the next patient.
I might have scared away some people with these words, but.....I actually want this one.
Longevity, like the original Chloe Signature, is superb.

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Edit: I've realised what this scent reminds me of: my beloved Green Tea by Elizabeth Arden!!! Chloé L'Eau is like a sweeter Green Tea with LOTS of fresh roses added!
The combination is absolutely heavenly imo...
I think the strong similarity between this scent and Green Tea is mostly because of the similarity of the opening note: strong, zesty grapefruit. And additionally, the base is similar too: lots of green, cooling oakmoss (not too dry/powdery fortunately.)

Original review:
I received this perfume by accident, but I LOVE it!!!

Wow, I don't know the original Chloe but now I'm wondering if I should test it! I love this perfume: it's a very pleasant, light yet sweet, slightly powdery rose scent.

I'm usually wary of oakmoss but in this scent it doesn't bother me at all!

This is a very potent beautifully balanced rose soliflore which would be perfect to wear in spring or even summer temperatures (although not in stifling heat probably).",09/12/21 15:11,JustSimpleThings
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I was really disappointed with this one. I'm having a run of bad luck with new to me fragrances at the moment. The notes sounded divine. I really like Roses de Chloe and rose tangerine is nice enough too so I was so excited to try this one. But it just doesn't work for me. I don't even get any rose until it becomes a skin sent and then if I press my wrist to my nose I get a faint whiff. Instead I get hammered with sour grapefruit and either the oakmoss or cedar, I'm not sure which it is, which makes it rather manly to my nose. And not in a good way, in a boy who has sprayed on a tonne of aftershave instead of washing way. It feels vaguely dirty and unwashed. I get no sweet litchi or smooth amber either. Just gassed by the citrus. Skin chemistry fail and I'm gutted but glad it's not a full bottle.",09/05/21 10:58,LMD

Lo and behold - there she was. Like at first sniff, love at first wear. It reeled me in before I even knew I had been hooked.
It is rural, yet cosmopolitan. A modern girl. Sharp and a little touchy, yet, at the same time fun and warm and sweet. And it stays. It feels like who I want to become in a bottle.

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Bought a 5mL of this perfume. I must say that it is a great summer citrus-rose scent! I smell a fresh laundry with this scent and it feels so comforting. The sour note it prominent here because of the grapefruit which gives a fresh feel to the fragrance.

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This was a blind buy for me, it's lovely but not my cup of tea. I use to love love florals and fresh florals but I guess I grew out of those scents. The longevity is decent couple hours on the skin. I have a brand new 1.6 ml bottle I only sprayed about 2-3 sprays. If anyone would like to purchase it off me or swap? feel free to send me a message!",06/02/21 06:57,smile2x3
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I am trying a 2ml sample.
It isn’t groundbreaking but for some reason, it’s oddly comforting. I use it after shower it smelled fresh, dewy rose with citrus on top.
This is beautiful rose, I will buy a full bottle soon.",05/04/21 09:21,TheFl0rist
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This lasts great for an edt which the house of Chloe does very well, stays my clothes for about 5+ hours! This reminds me of being in a magnolia and rose covered garden after fresh rainfall wearing a white sundress carrying a basket bag. I can't imagine anyone possibly hating this and would work well in spring and summer.",04/17/21 09:37,poohbearwinnie
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This is my first ever chloe perfume that I purchase. It’s so fresh and inviting, I really get the grapefruit and litchi here but not the rose. Which is great since I’m not a floral time of girl. I prefer fruity, fresh and sweet scents. It does pretty last long too. Overall, I super like it!💯",04/09/21 22:16,Fatchingg
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Something about this reminds me of a fancy hotel lobby or a luxe day at the spa. Even more than I like to wear it, I love to spray this in my bedroom & on my pillows/sheets. It’s such a beautiful, fresh, clean & crisp rose scent. Also, I think it performs really well despite the fact it’s an eau de toilette.",03/23/21 18:39,jussieboo
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"3 parts Delina 1 part Chloe original. This is very pretty, clean, fresh, rosy and is a bit sour. Very beautiful in my opinion.",03/04/21 11:07,floralfragrance
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This one has a clean scent of roses and citrus. As it settled, I got some very delicate woody notes. It's not bad at all - actually it's well blended - but on me it smells very generic, kind of a typical floral fragance with no character at all. I'm glad I sampled this, so I can say with absolute certainty that it's not my thing.

You might want to check it out if you're looking for a safe feminine, delicate floral fragrance, though.",02/23/21 17:22,LeAx
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This rose is fresh, lifts you up. Grapefruit and litchi make it so addictive, magnolia and oakmoss add sophistication. I love chloe fragrances and this one is the winner, even in winter I fully enjoy it. I think this will be great in spring and summer, but I am affraid that my 100ml bottle will be empty before spring arrives.",12/26/20 11:59,Ulusia
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"After mourning the discontinuation of the original Chloe L'eau (green juice) I decided to purchase the new pink juice, not totally blindly, however since last year I did actually sample it, but I can't really remember what it really smelt like. Cue the biggest bottle possible on order!

The new L'eau has the signature Chloe rose and cedar drydown, but where as the original L'eau was more green, soapy and a little bit like lemonade, this one is more sharp, fresh and crisp. Sharp, realistic grapefruit mixes with slightly sweet litchi and magnolia, once it dries down the rose and grapefruit stay put and oakmoss and cedar come forward to round the entire thing off.

Silage and longevity are great, as always with Chloe fragrances, gentle silage and 8 hours of longevity, this is also one of the few citrus based scents where the citrus notes don't vanish and actually stay anchored. Its an easy to wear scent, as I find with all Chloe scents, perfect for sping and summer, office safe and signature worthy, glad I got a 100ml bottle!",12/08/20 05:20,GinCatsBooks
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Chloe L'eau smells exactly like a bouquet of roses with the stems and the watery mist in the air from when you buy it from a florist, although rose is the most prominent note. It also smells fresher than the original. A very pleasant, pretty fragrance. Projection is excellent, and it lasts like an EDP without being weighed down.

ETA: I don't like green or soft floral fragrances and this is the ONLY fragrance on the market that can do grassy rose right.",12/02/20 13:32,Violeteyes
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I was actually planning on buying chloe edp but i ended up getting this instead. It's fresh and clean and somehow reminds me of EA green tea.

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"A very light and fresh combination of citrus and rose, it smells like you are fresh out of the shower in the best way possible, longevity is okay, but not the best, it lasts for a couple hours but then you only smell it if you put your nose close to the skin. Best Chloe perfume out of the ones I have smelled, would like to try the Chloe - Rose Tangerine next!",10/31/20 12:29,MidnightfantasyJenny
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Wow, this is a thousand times prettier than the original Chloe on me, which has a bitter green component I just can't jive with. Instead, this is a lovely, fresh citrus rose, with just enough of a slightly woody and oak moss base to give it some depth. It doesn't rock my world, but I can totally see people loving this and it being someone's signature. It would be appropriate for close quarters or a workplace where one has to be careful as to what one wears as far as fragrance. This is is a safe blind buy for citrus rose lovers, in my opinion.",10/27/20 05:33,Wwoman
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"One of my favorite scents from Chloe- love how light and breezy it is on me. Very fresh with citrus top notes and a nice mix of roses, magnolia over amber and musk- not overpowering. Love magnolia with the citrus.

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"A very forgettable fresh scent. Not bad by any means, but nothing to write home about. It's a very safe fragrance for ""no fragrance"" environments, you're not going to smell like much wearing this, instead people will just assume you showered not too long ago.",10/08/20 07:11,AlexandraTroush
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Very nice. I get that citrus smell straight off and it is almost peppery for me with those other components. The dry down smells sweet and it smells like very sweet white musk and amber has come to the party. I don't get the cedar nor the other bits at all. Its ""light"" and fresh. Settles down a bit but still there after a while. Can't say about longevity as I've just tried it at the chemist (drug store), however I like it. I much prefer Chloe Love though.",10/04/20 21:16,kristenboris1997
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"An absolutely stunning and fresh fragrance from Chloe, which has now become my favourite perfume house!This scent went from something I didn't like at all to becoming my signature scent. The L'eau is quite different from Chloe EDP and EDT. The top notes are of grapefruit, lychee and rose, which is the first impression you get, and some might be scared off by the tart grapefruit opening. But have patience, my friends! This is a fragrance I have become completely addicted to, I actually crave it, my mouth waters when I think about dousing myself! I love the fresh grapefruit when spraying! Perfect for summer and spring, although I will probably use it all year round. It is not particularly sweet and it's a rose perfume with a new twist. When the top notes dry, you notice the beautiful heart notes of magnolia and rose and the bottom notes of amber, oak moss and musk. Being an EDT, I think it lasts a very long time, although I love to spray it on myself often because I like the grapefruit top note so much! Feminine, fresh, summery and a ""clean"" smell that can be used at work as it is not polarizing or too strong. Although the opening may seem sharp, it dries down to a beautiful rose and magnolia scent. I have received compliments everywhere for this scent; the shop assistants, my students asking me what I am wearing, people serving me behind the till etc. It's absolutely mouth-watering gorgeous.",09/12/20 14:40,MissCee
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I wrist test it at the drugstore thinking it was the 2009 EDT one (with watermelon, rose and iris notes), but it definitely was L'Eau EDT, rosey, grapefruit citrusy, then later more magnolia and woodier. It's softer after 4-5 hours, but I could still smell it closer to skin after 12 hours. I like it, the soft woodiness is pleasant, it's delicate, classic, but overall not my style, same for the Chloé EDP, I don't know if I need more sweet in my floral perfume or if there is too much grapefruit or something else, it just didn't find the right spot on me.",09/09/20 15:57,Nancy83

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,This is a lovely soapy luxury rose. It isn't so much similar to Chloe EDP (which I love as well). It really reminds me of Cartier Goutte de Rose but Chloe is my fave one. It lasts longer than I expected (a couple of hours for sure). My most complimented fragrance currently.,07/02/20 01:31,Zu_Fragrance
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"After getting over the initial whiff, which was too much rose IMO, you start getting hint of the other scents and gets better over time. I especially liked the lemon and cedar combination.

Doesn't last as long as I hoped.",05/27/20 22:25,CheriLyn
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I got this in a perfume sampler box (where you try a bunch then choose your favourite for a large size). I am a gourmand gal, so this probably wouldn't have been a fragrance I would have tried otherwise. One spray on my wrist, after a shower.

My first thought was that this is an this is an 'innocent' or 'peaceful' perfume. By that, I mean I felt like I was transported back to a simpler time--being a young girl in a small prairie town, laying on the grass with my best friend on a warm summer day, making necklaces out of the flowers we found, without a care in the world.

I could still smell it hours later when I went to bed, very (pleasantly) rosy and very clean smelling, like I had just washed with fancy soap at a fancy hotel. [My husband (who knows nothing about fragrance) thought at that point ""it smells like Nivea lotion!"" :) haha]

I personally wouldn't buy an entire bottle of this, but I will relish my sample, and definitely use the entire thing.",05/09/20 10:32,bdragonfly12345
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Currently wearing a sample of this fragrance that I received in a Sephora order. This is really quite lovely! Definitely has that Chloé DNA of a clean, soapy rose.

I already have a full bottle of Chloé EDP so I don't feel like I need this one in my collection, but I'll happily finish my sample.",04/09/20 08:50,mermaidylady
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I must be the only one who absolutely hates this perfume. My husband asked when I sprayed it on, "" what is that insect repellent smell"". It was so strong that I had to wash it off. It is a shame because when I have first tried it in a shop smellt really nice. So agressive, loud, can not bear this smell. Maybe I have mistaken the tester with the chloe roses edition.",04/01/20 03:30,JKJKjk78!
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Love this very much. I also love most Chloe perfumes like Chloe EDP, Roses de Chloe.

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I must be anosmic to this because I put some hefty sprays on the back of my right hand and on paper and I can barely detect it. I get a bit of woods, some tartness and a hint of soapy rose.",02/25/20 20:51,Jmalone84
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I recently got a sample of this with a Sephora order and omg I’m so IN LOOOOOVE with this scent! I know the Rose note might scare people off but I promise you this isn’t your standard overpowering, powdery “old lady” rose. This is more subtle and mixed with the other notes is very fresh and sexy but still delicate. If I had to compare it to anything I would say it reminds me of OUAI hair products such as their Rose hair and body oil. Very feminine, very confident, very modern but still classic. The mood I get from it is like Glossier’s You. I can put it on and head to the office and smell like it hours later but it’s not overwhelming. At the moment I’m trying to desperately savor my sample but I will absolutely spend the money on a bottle of it (or aggressively leave hints for my husband that I want it for any upcoming gift giving holiday)",02/08/20 11:51,Suburbandecay
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This is really lovely and my favorite rose flanker from chloe. Very romantic, feminine , sheer...",02/05/20 05:43,KitKat
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"The perfect fragrance for Valentine’s Day 2020!

Sheer romance in a bottle, Chloe L’eau truly smells, to my senses, like being all loved up. No doubt this can also be owed to the flirty pink packaging, juice and trademark fabric bow. Regardless, I am so glad I have decided upon wearing this fragrance on Valentine’s weekend, after deliberating over a couple of others in my collection, Gucci Bloom and Si Passione by Giorgio Armani. Alas, this will fit perfectly with my millennial pink vibe!

As for the scent, the main story, I adore the effervescent lightness that usually does not appeal to me as a lover of heavy duty sometimes aggressively feminine perfumes. Chloe L’eau achieves a definite femininity but in a relaxed, elegant and confident manner. How typically French, and on that topic, might I add this transports me to somewhere fragrant in the south of France with each wear.

At the opening I’m hit by a mouth-watering sharp grapefruit mellowed by sweet litchi. The duo of zesty rosewater eventually intensified with damask rose results in a youthful rose note that is often hard to come by. Of all the recent rose drenched flankers introduced, this has to be one of the strongest. The juicy drydown leaves subtle lingerings of amber and a coy patchouli note. To those who judge Chloe L’eau for wafting away too quickly I can only assume our noses detect a heady patchouli entirely differently. That or my skin clings onto this fragrance for dear life. Nevertheless, a solid 6 hours wear for an EDT is impressive.

I would say this is a go-to for the summer months. However, having discovered my taste for it in a bitterly chilly mid January; now venturing into springtime, Chloe L’eau has a dewy perennial nature about it that makes it wearable all year round.

Chloe is a brand that plays it cool. Yet I can’t help think they would do well to emphasise the romance element fragrances like this conjure, not to the point of marketing nausea, but just to give them an edge on the competition. Beautiful perfumes like this are owed a little more love.",02/05/20 05:29,Livialovefragrance

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I expected something that smelled rosy & girly but this is very, very sporty. It opened as a grapefruit floral. A similar grapefruit to the one in L’Imperatrice 3, which I own and love. But then it dried down into an Elizabeth Arden Green Tea. I think it could work well in warm or humid climates.

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I got a free sample of this from Sephora. The first spray is incredibly light. You won't be knocking anyone out with this scent, it sticks very close to the skin. However, it's adorable!

It smells simply like rose water for the first couple minutes. After a few more minutes, a little bit of tartness comes through--but not an unpleasant tartness. It's the tartness of grapefruit without the actual citrus, if that makes sense. A little later, a few more floral and light fruity scents join the mix, without overpowering each other. Very fresh!

It reminds me of a late spring/early summer night out with friends, when the temperature hasn't gotten horribly balmy yet, but you definitely feel warm.",01/02/20 14:41,OtterMoone
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Ah, Chloe. Some years ago, I would never go near such a Big Brand, but missing an old collegue long gone who used to wear Chloe as her signature scent, (and a tester of Chloe’s L’Eau and Nomade from a magazine) changed my somehow stuck up way.
L’Eau is so wearable, rosy without the fruityness, a little sweet but poudery, an aromatic florall, if that can be said. used it daytime through advent this year, swiching to Maria Candida Gentile’s Cinabre at night.

L’Eau works well with:
Reading Vogue UK
Binging the overly sweet american dramedy «This is Us»
Ballerina flats (nude or pink optional)

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I tried this today in a 'why the heck not' moment of distraction.
Sprayed it once, on my arm, at about 11:30 this morning and can still smell it almost 9 hours later!
I like it very much and I'm not usually a Chloe gal at all.
I love cedar and this scent is certainly heavy on that note.
However, the citrus + rose are also still discernible at this point, very late in the dry down.
My only reservation is that the grapefruit is very strong in the opening accord and takes a while to moderate and blend in with the rest of the scent. There is sort of a 'lemon pledge' impression in the beginning.
Still, I would love a full bottle of this if I can find it at a reasonable price. At the moment the price point seems a bit high.

Edit 4/7/21: So, it's finally mine after a year and a half. Just got it for my birthday. It has indeed come down in price and I've sampled it several more times and really enjoyed it each time. I'm very much looking forward to wearing it this summer. It's just gorgeous!",12/18/19 10:22,cookygirl
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This is clean smelling and yet it is simply not unique. Nomade was a unique scent from all of the Chloe flankers, but this does not have much personality .

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This is equal parts rose (slightly sweet) and citrus, both grapefruit and lemon to my nose. I smell a little bit of a salty accord in there too. It's fresh and easily unisex, despite the girly pink bottle.",12/01/19 21:28,lechickpea
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Chloe never disappoints! I love this house. Based on other reviews I feel strange because the most intensive note I got from this beauty is rose. Sweet sweet rose mixed with some oakmoss. I didnt get much citrus but mostly rose. I tested alongside my mum, we absolutely adored it. So feminine, classy, lifts you up, makes you feel beautiful. Definitely going to buy this one day!",11/17/19 23:48,MairyLou
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Mid November is not the right time for this scent.

It's so consummately summery that I would never think to wear it past August. Like outdoors, blue sky, sundress territory. Compared to the mothership Chloe, this one is ""greener"" without really having the legit green notes. That makes it a little bit more unisex, less ""fashion"", and more fun imo. I want to kick off my shoes and be barefoot outside. I suspect the notes also perform better together in 70F + weather. A must have for next summer!",11/12/19 06:49,JackieM

Amazing, this creamy and mossy flanker is for me the best Chloe hands down and the most complimented by hubby in years. IMHO the best performance regarding fragrances launched in 2019. Strong projection and sillage too. Looking forward to see its rating in the fragrantica's awards as the year comes to an end..",10/20/19 07:39,EmHamburg
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Absolutely IN LOVE with this!! I am so surprised by it. I was expecting something very similar to the other Chloe’s such as the edp, absolute, and roses Chloe, but it hardly resembles them.
First blast of spray you would know it was from the Chloe family but it quickly changes to fresh and different! Must be the grapefruit that makes it so different to me. When it’s been on the skin a while , it reminds me of the tea note that is around in various fragrances.
I can’t explain how much I love this one. I have been wearing it all week and that for me is unheard of! I would even say it could be back up bottle worthy! Wow!😃",10/10/19 07:07,Mich03
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This came in an Ulta catalog as a scented paper strip and I really liked it. So I went to my local store to test it and WOW!! I've always been sort of lukewarm about Chloé perfumes; cute bottles but not in love with any of the scents. This one, however, is amazing! It's so fresh and rosy but with bite. When you smell it, you get a tingle of grapefruit bitterness on your tongue. The sillage is amazing for an EDT and an L'Eau at that. This is such a pretty everyday fragrance that could dress up even your favorite yoga pants.😉 10/10",10/07/19 14:30,junoMACguff

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"In short - the very first... unisex fragrance from Chloe.
It starts wonderfully, just like you'd expect from the absolutely beautiful bottle, delicate, fairylike rose,but after about an hour it changes into masculine smell (at least on my skin). I was testing it without checking the pyramid first and was surprised since it goes so totally against what it looks like. After seeing the pyramid now I know it must be the oakmoss responsible for that effect (grapefruit added may help in it) Now,the funny part is I normally do like oakmoss in perfumes, and don't mind unisex fragrances, but here the contrast between what I expected it to be and what I got worked sadly against the purchase. Well, I'm a huge fan of the house, own several bottles of Chloe myself, so I might change my mind eventually. But for now, it's no love. And I'm not very happy about that.",09/23/19 22:41,agarobka
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I did not like it at first, when I sprayed on the paper. I love the original and each flanker I observe with criticism, however Chloe always excels in it's feminine and elegant fragrances portfolio and never lets me down.
A week later I decided to give it another try on my skin this time and I managed to find some similarity to Dior forever and ever combined with the original chloe edt, which I have to admit actually I liked.
On the other hand, I am not sure if it is the timing of my country or the real launching of the scent, but definitely would not buy it for fall/winter",09/09/19 06:23,Pez_Enelrio
Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"oh!
I cant forget this scent!

Honestly speaking I was always fan of Chloe bottles I never liked any scent so much to buy the full size bottle. I wanted to like them but.. they were to me too agressive, too fresh .. just too harsh . .. .

This Saturday - 09.07.2019- I was in Lille, France in Euralille center -Sephora store.

I was checking which testers bottles are in this town the top empty.
...I was like what girls in Lille like the most...

One of almost empty... one was the bottle of leau of Chloe.

I said hmmm what French women like about it so much.

Then I have sprayed and I fall in Love!

A delicate, powdery rose... cover with oakmos and musky kiss adored with lichie pokes...
I am totally in LOVE in that fragrance.... I have sprayed twice on my skin- and I left.

I was walking and I felt I am in another planet... I am a princess lost in wrong time ... I missed my gardens near by my palace. . and my pretty, long,
roses... dress... My nature is romantic... so right away...when I have sprayed... I think I moved to my past life regression :) its hypnotizing.. for type of woman I am....

This scent is not for everyone but if you have a few percent of sensitivity and innocent ...personality... you will get... me as walking INFJ... I am in love ... perfume.... fro introverts.. to run away to world of fantasy from brutal near by ... world...


thank you Chloe.... whoever... done it... GREAT GREAT job!

Chloé L'Eau Eau de Toilette Chloé,"The opening is fresh, a bit powdery and a bit sweet. Later, the freshness tones down and the flowery sweetness dominantes. I usually dislike Grapefruit and rose, but in this fragrance they’re pleasant.
It’s not really original, to me it smells very similar to all other Chloé scents, but it’s still nice. It’s feminine, invigorating and carefree.
I recommend to to a young, funny and romantic girl.
Sillage is soft.

Very similar to Eclat de Vert by Aerin and Izia by Sisley, Mugler yellow cologne a bit.. remember me also some fresh fruity perfume of the 90s like Green Twist by Les Copains (not in this database) Really Parah (not in this database) and Roger & Gallet Pour l'Homme (guess: not in this database). Actually it smells a lot of blackcurrant.
Anyway nice fresh fragrance. Smell a bit like a dated deodorant and classic shampoo like Gabrielle does.",08/06/19 02:04,kl99
Chloé Collection 2005 Chloé,As many have said this one is very very very light. Perfect for maybe an interview. My initial thought about smelling it was clean laundry. It's very fresh.,03/29/14 20:49,pikachunicorn
Chloé Collection 2005 Chloé,"This one is little too delicate for me. It's very soft and watery - as Dahlia says above, nothing like the other Chloe fragrances.

Chloé Collection 2005 Chloé,"This one is a very pretty fragrance, not flat, firstly come fruits, but then come floral notes and sweet and spicy woodsy notes. These 3 layers ""play"": appear and disappear, mix and divide into parts.",06/17/11 02:34,MirabelleJee
Chloé Collection 2005 Chloé,I love to wear this perfume for everyday and it really is a light scent but strong enough to last all day. It is kind of hard to find now but many perfume discounter stores and ebay still sell it for really cheap prices.,06/29/10 11:47,michelle_belle_de_jour

Chloé Collection 2005 Chloé,I stand with dahlia for the character of the fragrance. Very fresh and easy to wear. Reminds me a bit of DKNY Be delicious in the top notes.,06/04/09 23:32,pmihova
Chloé Collection 2005 Chloé,"Chloe Collection 2005 is very different from the other Chloe fragrances, and is definitely NOT the same as the latest Chloe. Actually it reminds me the Chloe Innocence, but as a les flowery, more watered version. Collection 2005 is very light, fresh, unoffensive, innocent fragrance. It is not at all impressive or original, but it is just perfect for a hot summer day, when you don´t want to smell like something in particular, just lovely and fresh, a bit air-watery and in general cool. I think that the main difference between Collection 2005 and the latest Chloe is that there is no rose in Collection 2005, while the rose is very prominent in the Chloe 2008. In short, Collection 2005 is a good summer fragrance, very casual and easy.",04/12/09 02:23,dahlia
Nomade Chloé,I finally tried this on myself today. I have been smelling it on a coworker. She just retired and sadly does not work with us anymore but when I asked what she was wearing she said this. I kind of can smell it the way it was on her but when Im wearing it is smelling sharply but also sort of waxy. It is definitely very classy. I dont think this is for me to be honest. I do not think I can stomach it on such close distance on me. I can enjoy this but on distance. I still really love it but it will not be entering my collection.,11/07/25 08:47,Laurus
Nomade Chloé,"Chloe Nomade EDP is the underrated designer gem of the fragrance world. Gives off niche and luxury. I overlooked this fragrance for many years, because I am not a Chloe fragrance lover. They have all felt a bit ""meh"" to me. Too safe, too simple ""rose water"", tween, early college experience of a sheltered girl to me.
And to be quite honest, when there are multiple flankers of a fragrance, I get overwhelmed because the difference between each is almost always unremarkable, and I'm stuck making the most impossible choice: trying to decipher the tiny difference between them and pick the one I like the most. That is why i have avoided Chloe as a whole for so long (way too many Chloe flankers), much like the entire Miss Dior line. I felt this way about Nomade, because of the many flankers of it (8 total in the line including the original).
My SIL told me she enjoys wearing this, but I never really understood it, because from what I recalled it smelled sour and like dirt to me, but on her it smelled amazing! Clean, classy, has her sh*t together kind of scent. I decided to give it another sniff at a Sephora, and I was not fond of it, again! Looking back, it may have been ""scent smelling fatigue"" because my senses were overwhelmed and I was over all the smells I smelled that day.

I decided to take a risk and buy a full size bottle, and I am so happy I did. I wish we could post pictures with our review, because the dent I made in this fragrance within the first week should be studied. I have had it since May or June, and my bottle is more than half way done. It is such a unique scent, a modern chypre. She smells classy, clean, and woody. The dry down is quite woody and masculine leaning, but you don't get it as much on skin as opposed to clothes. I love to spray on skin and clothes, and the morning after when I come into contact with the top I wore with Nomade, it smells very woody, almost like a barbershop, but a nice relaxing woody aftershave. It is not offputting. I would hate if the fragrance was like that through and though. If I wanted that I'd wear Cedrus.

I think the mirabelle plum in the top notes and more gentle white floral with a delicate fruit in the middle really make this fragrance a feminine, tender, yet high performing modern chypre. You still get the mossy dry down and its heavenly. I loved it so much, I decanted a 5mL to take on my honeymoon when I only planned to wear my wedding day perfume for honeymoon related activities.

It also reminds me so much of my SIL. I love her so much, we have a great relationship, and it takes me back to the night we met her as a family for the first time. She came over for dinner, and she smelled soooo good. I don't wear fragrance for compliments, but this one I am always guaranteed a compliment when I have it on. Most recently, I was at a family dinner on my husbands side. His aunt hugged me and inhaled me so hard. She pulled away and said ""omg you smell so heavenly"". I also wore this to my now husbands work brunch they had to celebrate us getting married. The front desk receptionist kept telling me how amazing I smelled, so I gave her the decant of Nomade I had in my purse, and my husband said she still talks about how good I smelled that day in their office.

Nomade is such an easy reach, it is the first thing I want to grab when I am fresh and showered and clean, and the first thing I want to reach for when I go out for any reason (errands, shopping, dinner, hanging out with friends, etc). I have to actively make an effort to use my other fragrances. It smells so fruity, tart, yet earthy at the same time. The fruits, tartness and florals are grounded by the most amazing base of woods and moss. It is appropriate to wear in any situation: office, going out, family events, day to day, etc. It is well received by people around you when you wear it, without being the standard ""department store"" perfume DNA.",10/31/25 09:47,Futonbean

Nomade Chloé,"I have so many perfumes and out there are so many new releases that sometimes is easy to forget about the gems you already have.
This perfume is, without any doubt, one of the most prettiest and more special perfumes I've ever had. It is not strong or overpowering, just a sheer but noticeable woody-citrusy fragrance that smells casual and, at the same time, like no other designer perfume. It has a niche quality because of its uniqueness. Reminds me a bit of Byredo's profile, being subtle and so special at the same time.
It is a clean-woody scent, perfectly safe for office or everyday wear, signature perfume worth.
It is not loud, not girly, not too mature, not old fashioned, but ethereal, earthy, clean, chic, elegant, modern.
To me is perfection in a perfume. May not be suitable for going out or if you are looking for a loud perfume with crazy projection. But is soapy and warm, misterious and sheer. A must for every clean, woody chypre lovers.",10/08/25 00:01,Baileys

For sure it is best to wear it at winter and only at a daylight.Winter means less heat so its going to give a beautiful smell but not choking.This perfume is really strong, you have to know that.And thats also why I stopped using it.At summer it will give you a headache.

Nomade Chloé,"I really like this fragrance. The only reason I haven't bought it yet is that I'm looking for something that would feel like my signature scent at the moment - something I can wear daily and very effortlessly. Nomade is close, it feels like something a cool, independent, effortlessly chic person would wear! It's a unisex fragrance which I love, I feel like it starts off more feminine and fades into a more masculine, Chypre-sque smell. It's strong but not overwhelming, very wearable and elegant, would suit every season. I think I'd love to use it some time!",09/10/25 06:42,sandwolf

Nomade Chloé,"I have a sample of this perfume. It's a great office perfume, elegant, sophisticated and ""grown-up"", but it was also an instant headache for me, and on my skin it immediately turned stronger, more woody and leathery, the patchouli show up instantly. I'm a gourmand girlie, so it's not my cup of tea, and if I want a clean fragrance for work I usually reach for more ozonic/airy/soapy fragrances, but if you love chypre floreal perfumes, you could definitely try a sample.",08/31/25 04:53,veronicarose
Nomade Chloé,"I lean more toward niche these days but this is such a classy designer that sets itself apart from the rest. It is woody, citrusy, slightly sweet while never hinting at anything gourmand. I sampled it once years ago and it was an instant love but I didn't revisit it until now. It is a modern chypre that doesn't feel dated at all. It is unapologetically ""perfumey"" without being cloying and maintains a fresh quality. It really is a standout to me amidst the floral fruity gourmands still dominating the designer landscape. Absolutely signature worthy for the boho chic vibe and can be found at a great price. If you like diptyque or byredo style niche you might be pleasantly surprised by the value for this one. Now I'm on to trying the flankers.",08/28/25 09:30,desertdweller
Nomade Chloé,"Slightly strange: don't think I understand this composition very well. The particular combination of fruity top notes and chypre base notes doesn't sit well with me. Not awful, just needs a bit of time but ... strange.",08/26/25 00:44,alisonjwhiting
Nomade Chloé,"On paper, Nomade opens with a bright and sparkling fruitiness — sweet yet a little tart. It’s fresh, uplifting, and clean in the beginning.

The heart shifts into a floral bouquet, where jasmine takes the lead with a touch of rose. The peach softens things slightly, adding a powdery, almost creamy sweetness, but overall the florals stay light and airy.

In the dry down, it turns into a musky, lightly woody scent with just a hint of green earthiness from the oakmoss. It’s smooth, a little sweet, and ultimately a clean musk-forward citrus scent.

I can see how this could be a safe, well-blended fragrance for everyday or office wear, but its not for me. I personally wouldn’t wear it. Rating: 3/10.",08/21/25 20:36,HexedRose
Nomade Chloé,"I love this! Mirabelle note smells so happy and the grassy earthy oakmoss makes me feel like I'm lying in the forest surrounded by mirabelle fruits

Nomade Chloé,"I used to wear the edt more but I found the EDP super magical when I wear this every time! Smells like a confidence booster very put together. Fruity fresh earthy mossy a bit dirty as well some may find the opening of the edp too strong but please let it sits on your skin and wait for the magical dry down.

This perfume lives up to it's name Nomade IMO",08/13/25 00:56,barry1052
Nomade Chloé,"The main accords definitely reflect this perfume well. It opens up very citrus and moss forward and it’s softened by a fluffy woody perfumey vibe. I bought a travel size probably about three months ago and the first wear was offputting to me; almost screechy because the moss and patchouli was just too sharp. But for some reason, a few months later, it has softened up a ton and I almost find it wearable for my taste.

I think the part that makes it hard for me to truly like this is the amberwood and patchouli because it turns this into those basic “perfumey” scents you smell at department stores. There really isn’t anything wrong with that type of profile and I know that it is a staple for many, but it’s just not what I’m into. I can see how this would be otherworldly when it initially launched though.",08/08/25 12:47,Nicolep08
Nomade Chloé,"I love this fragrance, especially the opening!!! But it is STRONG. So strong that I’ve sprayed (ONE SPRAY) on my feet to see if that would help. There is something harsh about it that makes it super hard for me to wear. Love the notes, though. This is a boss lady frag, for sure.",08/07/25 15:14,SmithyFrag
Nomade Chloé,"Initially, I thought of this sent as a just a safe, non-offensive perfume. That is until everyone around me comments on how lovely I smell, even tho those people who do not care for perfume, making it a great choice for the office. Some reviewer on here said it smells like a sophisticated wealthy lady. I agree. The problem with this perfume is it's longevity and sillage...fairly weak.",08/07/25 14:18,K8deer

Nomade Chloé,"Chloé Nomade is a slow day spent wandering in a beautiful, old garden on the outskirts of town in late August. In the morning, the sun is lazily leaking through foliage, the scent of white flowers softly wades in. The meandering paths and dry and sandy, thet take you under old majestic oaks and you reach a secluded spot that overlooks the city from afar. In the afternoon, you roam deeper into the shaded part of the park. The florals become more distant and you are surrounded by the peaceful, warm and mossy air.",07/26/25 02:15,goldenmorning
Nomade Chloé,"Chtěla jsem tuto mainstreamovou vůni vyzkoušet. V porovnání s ostatními nomady je nezajímavá, zastřeně citrusová, rychle se rozloží na lacinou pánskou vůni. Ne nestojí za ten humbuk. Verze Naturelle a Naturelle Jasmine a nová verze d´Egypt ji strčí do kapsy. I Lumiere je o mnoho lepší.",07/20/25 03:31,caducei
Nomade Chloé,"I started wearing Nomade in 2022 after quitting my job to focus on my mental health. The juicy mirabelle gives it this unique brightness, and the oakmoss makes me feel like I’m surrounded by nature, like standing on a quiet mountain somewhere. I wore it while traveling solo, figuring myself out, learning to feel ok again.

Now I associate Nomade as my healing era scent. I even wear it around Christmas time as it uplifts my mood and reminds me of time off and being surrounded by people I love.

I’ve got about 10ml left in my bottle, and once it’s gone, I think I’ll pick a new signature. Life feels more stable now, and that deserves something new. But Nomade will always remind me of choosing myself :)",07/15/25 00:10,sleep_mode
Nomade Chloé,"I have such a soft spot for this one!

It was the first perfume I bought for myself after I got an office job in the city in my late twenties. I had spent my young adulthood travelling as much as possible and was still basking in the memories of my adventures.

It evokes for me a sense of elegant independence and the desire to explore the world gracefully, with an adventurous spirit.",06/24/25 10:29,ruin_raider
Nomade Chloé,"I did not like Nomade at first. I found it too mossy, too old-fashioned, too vintage in a way that was not wearable for me personally. I was never a fan of chypre scents, so I thought this would never grow on me, but how wrong I was!

I ended up giving my sample to my mother and, as soon as she sprayed it on herself, the room was filled with one of the most beautiful scents ever. It is a bit hard to imagine unless you've tried it for yourself. It is light and airy, yet it is grounded by the woods and the earthy moss accord. The honey-like plum mellows out the composition and adds the right amount of sweetness, preventing the citrus notes from turning too sour. Smells more expensive than it is. Expect people to notice when you're wearing it.

I read a comment below that compared this fragrance to what a forest fairy would smell like. Very accurate in my opinion.",06/16/25 09:56,neth
Nomade Chloé,"This one grew on me! At first the patchouli really overwhelmed me, but I've since come to love it. Nomade is classy and inviting with a bit of intrigue from its base notes. A beautiful chypre— and if it's old fashioned, it's in the same way pearls are. Elegant and beautiful!",06/10/25 13:33,Squeegee03

Nomade Chloé,"This is such a cool girl fragrance to me. I love it, it was love at first smell when I tried it back in 2022 during my days of working at a certain orange beauty store.

The way the mirabelle plum and citrus interact with each other is something I have fallen deeply in love with. The plum sweetens up the citrus just a perfect amount to keep it from being far too sour. As it dries down, and the florals and peach start to come through, it blossoms even more and it kind of even warms up the tiniest bit. I'd say the freesia is really only to add depth to the oakmoss note in here as the oakmoss is SUPER dominant, you really smart to smell it *with* the freesia and peach.

I feel like I'm not doing this fragrance justice with my review. I just love love love this, it's SUPER unique. I NEVER thought I would ever like oakmoss in a fragrance. I judged it by the sound of it at first. But I just love it.",06/03/25 23:33,liliazeib

Nomade Chloé,"This must be one of those perfumes that smell differnt on people's skin. At first all I smell is a lime toliet spray!
On the positive note, looking at the flankers, they don't have much citrus in. I do like some citrus perfume such as light blue and Libre. I will still try the other in the range, just not the eau de toilette.",05/27/25 08:18,Rach2star
Nomade Chloé,"I first bought this perfume back in 2020 — a 20 ml bottle on sale. It was love at first sniff. I was amazed by its longevity; it literally lasts all day (I could still smell it the next day), and on clothes it lingered for more than a week! I treasured that little precious bottle and used it only for special occasions because it was truly unique and special. Five years later, for our anniversary, my boyfriend surprised me with a gift set that included a 75 ml bottle. I couldn’t have been happier! I fell in love all over again with that familiar scent that evokes tenderness, freedom, and strength in me. Nomade has that distinctive blend of fruity and earthy notes — the scent of mirabelle plum, refreshing freesia, and elegant oak moss. It perfectly balances femininity and confidence. It’s not overpowering, yet it leaves a strong impression. This is a perfume I wear for a reason — to feel special. It has character, depth, and that unexplainable “something” that makes people remember it. A warm recommendation to anyone looking for a long-lasting and elegant fragrance. For me — the best perfume ever. ☺️",05/24/25 09:23,Mici2912
Nomade Chloé,"Nomade was the perfume I wore for my wedding. It was the perfect choice. The scent of course brings me very happy memories of a beautiful day, but I chose the fragrance because it smells like laying in a big patch of moss in the middle of a rainforest at dawn & I thought it would be a great fit for my wedding perfume since it was in a garden. The scent is sophisticated, yet delicate, and it has many layers to it. It starts of very fresh and citrusy and eventually dries down to a green and comforting scent. The perfume lasted all day and the people getting ready with me really enjoyed the perfume and asked what I was wearing. I cherish it now more than ever. :)",05/22/25 18:20,chrissy98

The base notes really shine through and it’s patchouli … I can sometimes do it but this one , I can’t .",05/20/25 22:26,Mgrijalva
Nomade Chloé,"Nomade means a lot to me. I bought a full bottle right after trying a sample when it first launched in 2018, which is very rare for me. Usually, it takes months or even years before I commit. But Nomade came into my life at the right time, and it stayed. It marked a period of real growth for me, and every time I smell it, I remember that. It carries a sense of pride and strength I’ll never forget.

The scent itself is something special. It’s woody, but in such a way you don’t even realize it. It's earthy, but also incredibly airy and light. It's a perfect balance between feminine and masculine. Strong, grounded and free, bold but not loud. It works, in a very honest way.

And maybe that’s why it speaks to me so much. I live a nomadic life - I travel constantly, changing countries and continents, and it’s not always easy. It takes real inner stability to keep going when nothing around you stays the same. Nomade captures that feeling for me completely. It smells like movement with roots.

I’ll always love this one.",05/18/25 08:19,MetaMystic
Nomade Chloé,"This is such a great sophisticated scent to wear on a day when a lady needs to feel a bit bold, as if she has her $#i+ together. Those of us who love Chloe Nomade don't tend to care if others find it ordinary, or lacking in depth, or too masculine, because we are grown women who just don't bother to waste our time seeking the approval of others. We may wear what we like and enjoy it. Merci, monsieur Bisch, for this lovely gem of a fragrance. The earthy oakmoss dry-down is just so divine.",05/17/25 21:09,JuliaSchmickmillen
Nomade Chloé,"She is a nomad. She has travelled the world in linen pants, felt silk and furs through her fingers in artists' markets in Tangier, smelt intoxicating spices in Mumbai and drank pu'er tea in Xi'an. She has noted the bitter military encampment in Myanmar, noted life's injustices simply by being able to be a single woman travelling relatively undisturbed due to the power of her passport. She misses nothing, romantisizes nothing. That said, she loves hard, and has intense, passionate affairs. Men in Spain. Lovers in France. Even a fellow nomad traveller she'd met in Montevideo. She cannot be tied down, and she always travels alone. So I can better experience things, she says, without another person's perspectives skewing me. A self-assured, quietly powerful woman who is both at home in a pair of heels in a Ralph and Russo gown or Birkenstocks and a ratty tank top.
She is a witness. She is a traveller. She is a lover. She is Chloe Nomade.

I feel like this perfume, like the woman she is for, is quietly confident in itself as well. Woodsy, well balanced, and with a very well done plum note, she knows the people who will appreciate it, and doesn't mind the people who don't. She's not pretentious. She's just waiting for the right woman to discover her",05/13/25 19:51,KingPabou

Nomade Chloé,"I typically love Chloe perfumes, but I just don't get along with this one I guess. The plum is overwhelming, screechy and gives me a headache. I love woody and mossy fragrances, but Nomade is all synthetics. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but when you are used to smelling the natural ingredients, it can be rather confusing to refer to something as ""oakmoss"" when it is not.

Nomade really isn't woody or mossy to me at all. After the harsh fruit wears away, I pretty much just get a soapy Egyptian musk. I actually like that part, but the fragrance just doesn't match the pyramid or the concept to me at all. Lasts all day with a couple sprays.",05/12/25 08:27,AveParfum
Nomade Chloé,"Another signature scent of mine that I truly adore. Quentin Bisch has this genius way of making woody notes feel like fantasy spun into fragrance. Nomade is power, it’s elegance that doesn’t try too hard, a beauty that refuses to fade. For me, it’s the best from Chloé.

The opening? A sparkling burst of mirabelle, bergamot, lemon, and orange fresh, uplifting, like a sunbeam through treetops. The heart blooms with freesia, jasmine, rose, and peach, adding that soft feminine depth. But the real star? Oakmoss. It’s what lifts this blend into something magical. Patchouli adds that rich, earthy base, while amber, musk, and sandalwood wrap everything in warmth.

It’s the scent of a fearless spirit. I’m already on my second bottle and still in love.

It reminds me of my grandma, her house always smelt floral woody because of her well kept garden and wooden kitchen utensils. This is the smell of when I stepped out freshly showered into her house.",04/23/25 11:06,yellowflower_
Nomade Chloé,"it somehow feels crispy, like the forest. florals are really refreshing. there is definitely a masculine character but overall i'd still say that this is a woman's fragrance. performance is way better than other chloe's.
i love this!!!",04/21/25 12:14,gizzyco

Nomade Chloé,"I got a decant of this and wasn’t expecting much
But im surprised i really do like it
It does smell very classy and elegant but also pretty unique at the same time
Its neither juvenile nor mature
When i smell it i imagine being in a slightly shadowy garden
Idk if i want to smell like this to others cus it would seem like a false advertisement (im not really outdoorsy type) but id love my home to smell like that as it’s a really pleasant scent",04/16/25 00:17,lenaurbanskaaegyo

Nomade Chloé,"This is by far my most complimented perfume. I prefer wearing this in slightly warmer weather, like spring and early summer.",04/11/25 01:44,beautyandbooks
Nomade Chloé,"This is kind of experience fragrance that you have to wear properly, have to spray on yourself and feel how develops, is not a kind of fragrance you try on paper test or just a little on wrist, you will not feel all the experience in this way, because this perfume has a deep layers, something you will seem by the time goes by, it was a late discover for me, but I'm glad I have now🩷",04/07/25 16:27,rziotti
Nomade Chloé,"After reading (way too many) reviews on this, I had to double check that I received the correct item from Sephora. I sprayed on my inner elbows and wrists and immediately got a sweet, juicy … something. Truly I cannot put my finger on the fruit scent I’m getting, but it’s fleshy and at the forefront for quite a while.

I DO like this fragrance, but I am simultaneously a little disappointed that it reads SO fruity and sweet on me. I was under the impression this was leaning into the 90’s chypre-floral realm and couldn’t wait to explore it.

This started off as a Christmas candle and evolved into shampoo. Maybe I have a skewed perception of what a genuine, vintage (I say for lack of a better term) chypre is. I did get some spice and warmth for a few minutes in the opening, it just didn’t last. Overall, I’m happy with it! It’s definitely better performing and more unique than the other Chloe’s I have tried. I also want to get up and move around just to get those sweet, magical little wafts of myself ☺️

I hardly recommend blind-buying, so definitely try before you buy.",04/06/25 22:01,Alluring_Gloom
Nomade Chloé,"I work at a souvenir shop and the other day a woman came in and filled the corridors of the store up with this beautiful scent that reminded of what I imagine a fairy smells like. It was green and fresh with a very delicate floral. As I am not shy, I went up to her and asked her what she was wearing. She told me it was this perfume. So that same day I went to the store to smell (and maybe buy it as I had loved it so much). When I sprayed it on paper and on my wrist I was so disappointed. It smelled nothing like her. There was a spiciness that made it smell like DIY coca cola. However when I went back home I kept getting that same smell I felt on the lady. The drydown on this is quite beautiful and unique. The scent trail is gorgeous. I still dont like it when I smell it directly on my wrist. But the scent trail is something different. Like a beautiful orange zest with a delicate floral.",04/04/25 06:04,Ema Direito
Nomade Chloé,"Very interesting scent. The first 5 minutes it was too screechy but then it dried down to a very pleasant, unique floral/woody scent that somehow reminds me of midnight....I don't know how else to describe it lol...That is what come to mind for me: midnight. I like it! It is musky and dewy. Nothing like the original Chloe.",03/26/25 06:54,carrico1986

Nomade Chloé,Chloe Nomade is my BFF for life. I just wish she was more beast mode in her projection. I have no idea what Mirabelle smells like but I do get a hint of guava in the opening of this fragrance that is so unique.,03/18/25 17:48,My Fragrance Connoisseur
Nomade Chloé,"The opening is interesting, with soft mirabelle and oakmoss adding a delightful nuance. The freesia is beautiful, and the musky drydown is nice. Overall, it's an enchanting and intriguing scent that makes me feel like a whimsical forest fairy. It's not what I'd expect from the usual Chloe line which I'm also a fan of, so I appreciate this uniqueness. I do wish the oakmoss were more prominent, as I love the earthy charm very much. Unfortunately, the performance could be stronger, as it's quite weak in terms of projection and longevity.",03/18/25 10:28,RisyaAyu
Nomade Chloé,"It’s just so gooooodd, so addicting perfume for some reason. So nice, unique and quite complex, but so beautifully feminine scent. Inoffensive, perfect level of sweetness.
For me, it’s mostly a powdery, woody and floral perfume. Very little citrus-y.

Sillage is good, longevity as well! Lasts for about 7-8 hours on me I’d say. On clothes it lasts til washing the piece, amazing!!!

9/10 from me",03/10/25 08:30,mammumetsas
Nomade Chloé,"I still have my tiny 30mL bottle of this that I bought in 2018. I was in the hospital, and was advised that I shouldn't spend all my time in my room lying in bed. So a friend took me to a local shopping centre and we looked at perfumes. I ended up buying this and it kept me company for the remaining month I spent in hospital. It means a lot to me. It's such an uplifting scent. My bottle is seven years old. Astounding to me. I barely wear it anymore, but every time I do... beautiful.

Vibrant citruses, jasmine, freesia, rose, peach and mirabelle, oakmoss, and patchouli ... in that order. Someone below compared it to 90s aquatics and ... yes. 100%",03/02/25 04:59,DT804

Nomade Chloé,"Juicy FRESH fruit -- I make that distinction as someone who typically steers clear of fruit-forward scents. Not syrup-y sweet, but a dose of juiciness atop dewy white florals.

Nomade Chloé,"Nomade is so well blended, so well put together, so perfumey.... Don't be fooled! It cannot invite you to adventure, but more like to a fancy picnic. Real nomads who seek the rawness of experience and tent accommodation under the stars won't find a partner in this one. It smells expensive and will make you look like a wannabe. It lacks the edge you would expect from the name.
On the other hand, it's safe as a blind buy / as a gift to someone who feels young, feminine and classy.",02/03/25 10:31,Adela7
Nomade Chloé,It's a very complex scent that definitely smells expensive. It's a more mature scent rather than youthful. I'm not a huge fan personally and I've never been complimented on this one.,02/01/25 19:24,Hannnah
Nomade Chloé,"Instantly brought to mind watery-florals of the 90s. I immediately got Calvin Klein Escape, some sense of Elizabeth Arden Sunflowers, even a little bit of L'eau D'Issey.

Now I understand the whipsaw here between ""dated"" and ""stunning"". My bet is that Millennials smelled this profile on grown women when they were children, so it feels dated to them. Gen X is loving it because it was our jam back in the day, and Gen Z are finding it interesting because they haven't smelled this profile before.

I didn't get any of the woody/mossy drydown described, it just went soapier and soapier on me, so I layered with The Maker Stag today and it's grounding it nicely.",01/30/25 07:58,Cielle11
Nomade Chloé,"I got a travel size of this and really wanted to like this based on some of the other reviews, but it just reads as dated to me. I'm not sure if it's because fragrance, like most other things, can be cyclical in fashion/style, but this too strongly reminds me of what older women were wearing (and probably over-spraying) in the 80s when I was a kid.",01/25/25 05:51,mxpines

Nomade Chloé,"I had Nomade for about a year and I really tried to feel comfortable wearing it.
No other perfume impressed me as much as this one did. The smell of freedom, peace, love and an enchanted forest.
It's different, easy going, with caracter, it makes you fall in love and smile. It smells airy, sparkling, creamy and something slightly caramelized.

But there's no escape from the aftershave scent of the drydown...and it's all I smell for hours.
A linear and intrusive oakmoss :(
But a good side is that every time I'd open my wardrobe, I'd smell Nomade on clothes and it smelled absolutely divine !

I wonder if I'd end up buying it again one day...",01/14/25 14:03,Elenad
Nomade Chloé,"True to its name, this is perfect for a soul always on the move; for a wanderer in pursuit of the horizon. This lends a refreshing yet timeless new perspective on the classic chypre scent. Opens up as a clean floral meadow sprinkled with cinnamon and a sparkling touch of mirabelle zest, playfully earthy and light. As it sits, the florals become heavier with a very generic rose dominating the drydown. What saves this for me though is that mossy rootedness of the undertone that keeps the scent from fading into something too ordinary. A scent to remind free spirits of home no matter where they roam.",01/09/25 14:38,luvoxlixir
Nomade Chloé,"ughhh i hate how much i love this. i certainly didn't expect to after the letdown that was chloé edp, but nomade is an undeniably !!! gorgeous !!! perfume. like chloé it screetches on opening - astringent and citrusy, almost choke-hazard worthy. (i'm starting to think that's part of the brand's dna.) it's the kind of perfume you immediately want to hate. but once it starts drying down, there's no use. it turns into this beautiful, understated burst of soft jasmine, freesia and slightly fruity goodness, wrapped in what i can only describe as a powdery, musky hug. it's not overwhelmingly woody on me like i've seen other reviewers say, but the base notes certainly give the fragrance warmth and depth, tempering the citrus and white florals rather impressively. it's elegant, aromatic, and after a few hours of sitting on the skin it turns into this beautiful soapy, woody mix i can't get enough of. other reviewers say this is barely feminine; i'd like to disagree. this is a woman in her mid 20s with her shit just barely together: independent, stylish, with a vintage look and a modern attitude.",01/08/25 11:50,nadalaforet
Nomade Chloé,"This one is definitely not something that I would personally like to smell on everyday basis. I am not even sure I could say that I actually ”like” how it smells as a scent - yet wearing it every once in awhile is an enjoyable olfactory journey nevertheless. It is obvious that it was created by someone with a really good nose and great sense about the power of scents in evoking emotion and memories.

When it comes to how it actually smells to me is a somewhat generic modern feminine perfumey opening that is quickly turned into an overwhelming and somewhat unpleasant men’s cologney (though more old timey one rather than contemporary favorites) scent with a slight hint of an elegant, if somewhat dated classical women’s perfume lingering in the background. After a while the “men’s cologne” overload wears off leaving you with an actually quite nice subtle aromatic woodsy, slightly spicy and slightly sweet base. I can see how this scent could be just the right one for someone and very addictive if it genuinely feels like “your” kind of scent, but it is mostly a no for me personally.

BUT - what I love about Nomade is that even if you are not particularly fond about the scent, it can still be a very uplifting experience when worn at the right moment. How I picture it, is a busy career woman in her late 20’s or 30’s in a bleak rainy autumn day, stopping at a cafe after workout, wearing expensive yoga pants, her head filled with e-mails to answer and errands to run, when suddenly a Simon&Garfunkel or Mamas and Papas song starts playing and she is temporarily transferred into another time and place. She pictures herself sitting by a late summer bonfire at a beach after a sunset, with guitar playing and some guy lending her his brown suede jacket when it starts getting chilly, his scent mixing with hers.
To me Nomade isn’t an actual old timey or bohemian perfume, but it definitely has elements that can create an idealized nostalgic image of a carefree flower child. It isn’t an authentic image of an era, but it is much more wearable than what a more photorealistic version could ever be.

Nomade isn’t a scent that I would love unconditionally, but it is a work of art that I respect. It often feels like every new release that has gained any hype during the past couple of years has either been a fairly one-dimensional gourmand vanilla bomb, a more “complex” scent which in this context means that it contains more notes but all of them are amped up to the max lacking balance OR an undoubtedly interesting, yet utterly unwearable niche creations. Nomade is a refreshing exception to that pattern as it is a well balanced, yet multi-dimensional scent that is still subtle enough not to offend the majority of people around you.
It is a feminine leaning scent, but could very well be worn by a guy as well. Sillage is moderate (which I consider as a pro instead of a con for this type of scent) but by no means weak and longevity is actually quite impressive though not eternal. Can be worn both day and evening and in all seasons, though I find it most suitable for transitional seasons (autumn or early spring). Not the safest blind buy for everyone, but if you love heavy vintage style chypres and are looking for more inoffensive and office appropriate daytime scent, Nomade could be a good bet - or conversely it could be a gateway drug into the world of chypres for a contemporary gourmand girl as well.

As a sidenote: I received miniature bottles of Nomade and Burberry Goddess at the same time and noticed that they actually pair quite beautifully when layered together. So if you have both and find Nomade “too masculine smelling” and/or Goddess too sweet or simple it is worth trying to layer them.",01/07/25 20:01,AvrilElaine

Nomade Chloé,"After having tried (and not being ""wowed"" by"") Chloe EDP, I was somewhat apprehensive about trying this fragrance, but it was on my list so I finally got around to it today. There was something about the opening, perhaps the mirabelle, that was incredibly off-putting, but once I got past that I began to really enjoy this. The only other problem, however, is that it is incredibly weak; even with multiple sprays on my arm I can hardly smell it anymore, after having applied it just an hour ago. Had this been a bit stronger I would have certainly considered adding this to my list, and perhaps if an intense version of this is released in the future I may consider a purchase.

Also, I must say that I was incredibly surprised by how good this smelled in the dry down, especially considering that moss notes don't tend to mix well with my chemistry. I am fairly certain that this is the first fragrance with oakmoss that I have actually enjoyed on me!",12/31/24 12:03,AubreyNoel
Nomade Chloé,Absolutely adore this perfume. It’s such a unique pairing of scents that I can’t quite replicate in any other fragrance. I like that it’s not in-your-face feminine but still reads as a perfume.,12/26/24 17:39,meats
Nomade Chloé,I saw someone in the review says that this is a modern chypre and I blind bought it. It's weird but I love it so much. The patchouli and oakmoss combined with all those citrus notes make a guava-like scent. It's to my personal liking so it's a safe blind buy for me. Will not recommend this to random people.,12/21/24 21:53,vkthemermaidlagoon
Nomade Chloé,"So, i tested this when it was released, hated it with a passion...6 years later and i dont know what happened but i love it now! Maybe because i more used to niche fragrances and this one is truly a stand out in the designer world of perfums. Last a long time with great projection and many many compliments! I smell the signature touch of mr quintin bisch in this, it even remindes me a little bit of valaya, wich is also a love of mine. On if the best designer out there!",12/15/24 04:54,Miek82
Nomade Chloé,"It's not bad. I actually really love the opening. It smells like a fresh forest with berries covered in dew drops... very unique.

Nomade Chloé,Not a safe blind buy. I got this because of the good reviews and because I adore Chloe. I thought if I liked Chloe so much how can I go wrong with another of their creations. Boy I was wrong. I get no citrusy and no floral notes. I get nothing sweet. It’s just wood. Moss. Strong. I sprayed once on me in the am around 7:30. Still strong by 2 when I got home. I was also told I smelled like a Christmas tree. I don’t know if it was my skin chemistry or what. By the time I got home I was so intoxicated by the smell I was nauseous. And no I’m not pregnant. I got in the shower and scrubbed three times to get rid of the nasty smell. This reminds me of an old church lady. Just GROSS.,11/27/24 18:26,Yllowstar7
Nomade Chloé,Not a safe blind buy. I wanted to like this.. I really like Chloe and thought perhaps I will like this one. Also reviews said it reminds people of miss dior Cherie. This is awful.

Very smart. But fortunately Nomade EDP has stood the test of time and found an audience of raving fans.",11/18/24 21:35,GoodVibrations
Nomade Chloé,"One of the best designer fragrances on the market. As a suede chypre, this perfume has an amazing tickling texture to the nose in its early stages, ingeniously mimicking the texture of suede through an olfactory sense of texture or tickle. It’s an amazing accomplishment, it’s beautiful, it’s chic, it’s high-end, and it’s unique. People keep saying Nomade smells masculine or they have some complaint along those lines, but perhaps they don’t realize that A) this is a suede chypre, therefore it’s not supposed to be anything like the sweet candy mass market messes that have been invading sinuses for decades since Angel was introduced and it’s not supposed to smell like a fruity floral bouquet, and that B) in the early part of the 20th century some of the legendary classic women’s perfumes were smoky leather chypres, which smell masculine by today’s standards (ever try vintage Bandit by Piguet?) because GUESS WHAT: the era starting with the launch of Mugler’s Angel through the present is the first time in the history of perfumery that there has been a trend of people actually wanting to smell like they have been rolled in caramel and chocolate and then covered in cotton candy and topped with funnel cakes. I like smelling Angel in moderation on someone else occasionally, but it’s the lengthy trend started by Angel that I’m citing. I don’t think that smelling like a state fair or a candy store or an ice cream shop is alluring. Why not just be exotic and introduce turkey and dressing perfume that you hose on with a turkey baster? Nomade EDP is an excellent contribution in the movement to return to some glorious perfumery traditions such as leather chypres, fougères, chic non-foody florals, sensuous woods, and warm spices that don’t cause migraines with yet another variety of cardamom and pink pepper overload.

In case I didn’t make it clear, that accord in Nomade that people can’t figure out is called SUEDE. Yeah, it’s something we had BACK IN THE 1900’s! Yeah, yep, yes, that’s right, suede has a smell, and no, they didn’t actually dip suede in the perfume to macerate. It’s an accord, and creating accords that smell like things that are altogether different from the individual components is called the art of perfumery. And those who haven’t heard of chypres… welcome to perfumery, young cherubs. There are some very good books on perfumery out there. There has been a chypre shortage since the introduction of Angel and the gourmand revolution that ensued, AND since the 2005 EU regulations struck down many of the classics. We finally got a good suede chypre that’s widely available, so let’s please not spoil it for the seasoned perfumistas (the ones who actually keep these companies in business) just because it doesn’t have 5,000 calories per spritz. Once upon a time throughout the entire world, perfumery didn’t smell like Willy Wonka’s factory. Some of us actually like what we consider to be “real” perfume, and women’s perfume used to be strong and sometimes rugged. Don’t hate it just because it doesn’t cause cavities. It takes an experienced nose to appreciate this.

Nomade EDP is a 10/10.",11/18/24 21:16,GoodVibrations
Nomade Chloé,"Beautiful, feminine patchouli-forward scent. I like this better than the Chanel patchouli scent profile. It's tart and fruity in the opening, with fresh florals and mossy, woody patchouli in the drydown. I agree it can remind one of the old school feminine chypres, but it feels definitely adjusted to the modern age - which is not a bad thing. It's pleasant and not overly strong. Honestly, one of the best designer fragrances as of recent.",11/16/24 00:53,Heliodora
Nomade Chloé,"Deeper than it first appears, holds beauty and mystery in equal measure. Does have that “designer perfume” note, but there’s a lot more going on, and it’s much softer than that sounds. Definite citrus on the opening, I get the freesia and jasmine too, white florals that, while marginally heady, are far from screechy in this iteration. A reviewer before me described it as the kind of scent that wakes you up in the morning, which is such an apt observation.

Warm, fresh, vivacious but sleek, romantic. More a scent for transition seasons than summer or winter. Nomade is really nice, but isn’t a particularly innovative or unique fragrance; to me, it’s a springtime citrus and white flower bouquet that’s one of a crowd of fragrances with a similar profile. It’s familiar in a way.

It is, however, done well, and avoids numerous pitfalls that threaten a scent this effervescent. A “that girl” type fragrance. The depth that emerges as it wears is so welcome: it matures, in a way, becomes more of a unique fragrance. The dry down is rich and lovely, woody with a touch of peach and freesia sweetness, and the longevity is strong all day.

This is the natural beauty of the girl next door, insouciant and carefree, who wears her hair down over jeans and a white t-shirt, who walks barefoot around the house and yard in the summer.",11/15/24 11:33,darkforestmags
Nomade Chloé,"When you spray this fragrance, for a few seconds, it smells like lemon liquid soap.
After that, it smells 100% like moss.
As someone who like forest scents, this one is not on my list. That moss smells very cheap, and it is a bit spicy, like ginger.
Forest Ritual by Tesori d'Oriente smells similar to Nomade by Chloe, and it is only 8€.",10/30/24 13:30,JuliaToothFairy
Nomade Chloé,"Initially, the blast of white floral/citrus in the beginning was a little harsh for me. But this is like for 10 seconds. Afterwards, the brightness mellows down slightly, into a beautiful, juicy plum dusted with brown spice and woods. Very big fan of this one, especially the lightly sweet and smooth drydown. I like wearing this on overcast, warmer days. Bonus points if it's windy. I dunno, the vibe is just right for that.",10/28/24 18:40,Dingathy

A woman in a brown polkadot top and a brown skirtsuit wearing chunky sneakers to hurry to her corporate job, then changing into brown pumps. Brown cubicles, brown ring in the coffee pot. Brown curly perm. And those brown translucent ashtrays. That's what I see most of all--the brown ashtrays. The polar opposite of free-spirited.
I wish I got what everyone else gets, I really do. But this is the perfume that taught me that peach and oakmoss are very difficult notes for me. The comments below almost make me want to go out and try it just once more (I remember the dry down was tolerable). But nope...it's just not for me.",10/18/24 21:02,Treachaseff

Nomade Chloé,"I don't know why but I get the notes in this scent in an order opposite from fragrantica.
I get a more powdery start, but a round scent like a balm or something, still warm but very fresh.
I dont think the citrus in this is prominent, nor the rose. I get a more white flower, balm, clean powdery scent that sits warm on the skin and that is beautiful ik itself but maybe not what you expect from reading the notes.",10/08/24 06:43,Frannie93
Nomade Chloé,"I LOVE this. It opens bright and citrusy with notes of mirabelle, lemon, bergamot and peach before the white florals quickly step in and take over; freesia, jasmine, maybe just a hint of rose. White florals aren’t usually my thing, but they’re not too loud or overdone here and they combine beautifully with the citrus top notes. The base is musky and woody, with a hint of herbal freshness from the patchouli and oakmoss.

I honestly feel like this is an anytime scent, but if it had a peak season it would probably be spring. I happily wear it year round anyway. I’d also say that, while it’s marketed towards women, I feel men could easily pull this off too should they wish to.

It both lasts and projects beautifully until it fades gradually and graciously away into a clean skin scent.

Nomade Chloé,"I guess I have officially become a Quentin Bisch-fangirl because whatever this guy composes, I'm head over heels in love. First Delina Exclusif, then Amouage Guidance and now Nomade.

Chloé is not a house I'm fond of and this scent has nothing to do with my scent personality. Chpyres? Oh no. But I am hooked on Nomade. It is bright, but not overtly positive and girly bright. It has a clean, sleek charisma. It starts floral-fruity on my skin but settles into a warm, woodsier scent.

We can all sometimes break the rules, right? Because I'm adding this to my collection.",10/03/24 06:43,Revontuli
Nomade Chloé,"Fresh, bright, fruity, citrusy, warm, softly sweet, romantic, sensual, spicy, woody, floral, earthy, complex, unique

Surprisingly, I pick up on all of the notes that are listed for this one. This opens bright, fruity, citrusy, and floral with fruity bergamot, lemon, orange, mirabelle, and peach and floral jasmine, rose, and freesia. The more this dries down the more noticeable the warm, earthy, and spicy base notes become, the oakmoss, patchouli, amberwood, white musk, and sandalwood. The balance between bright, fruity, and citrusy, floral, and warm, spicy, and earthy notes is what makes this so pretty, romantic, and sensual.

I think this one is very fitting for spring, summer, and fall, but definitely works for winter too. I get great performance with Nomad. The longevity is really good, about 7-8 hours before becoming a skin scent. The projection is really nice too, it radiates out a few feet from me.

For reference, I only have 2 other Chloe fragrances Love Story and Chloe EDP. Some of my other favorite floral/romantic fragrances include Coach Love (original 2012 version), Coach Poppy Blossom, Coach Wild Flower, Flowerbomb, FB Ruby Orchid, FB Nectar",10/01/24 21:46,Shimmer412
Nomade Chloé,"This perfume was recommended to me by someone else. I became curious and read the comments here. They described it as so different, enchanting, and extraordinary that I eagerly went to Sephora and smelled it. First, I sprayed it on a test strip and could barely detect any scent. Then I sprayed it on my wrists. I immediately felt a disappointment. The performance is very low, and the sillage is minimal. You have to press your nose close to smell it. As for the scent itself, it's one of the simplest I've encountered. The opening is dominated by bergamot and lemon, followed by oakmoss and patchouli. The plum is almost non-existent, and the flowers are very faintly present in the background. This scent reminds me a lot of Elizabeth Arden's Green Tea Summer. Actually, it resembles any $10 perfume in that Green Tea series. It's not unpleasant, but very simple and familiar. You could create this perfume by taking any green tea flanker and adding patchouli. It was so praised online that I wondered if I had tried the wrong perfume, so I went to another local store to smell it again. Unfortunately, it was the right one. I really believed I would love this perfume; it's disappointing.",10/01/24 08:30,gingerrose
Nomade Chloé,"Growing up in the late 90’s / early 2000’s, my parents wore Hugo Boss and Calvin Klein Obsession for women. Chloe Nomade makes me nostalgic for my childhood, watching my mom put on her makeup in the bathroom before going out with my dad. Smelling the intoxicating scent of their fragrances mix and linger in the air. It reminds me of family get-togethers, the holidays, and the feeling of wonder.
The oak moss accord (one of my favorite notes) is definitely what makes me compare this perfume to “older” style fragrances, and I mean this in the best way possible. It smells fresh and bright (almost sparkling), woody and slightly spicy.. it’s simple yet so unique compared to most modern scents. This is perfect for anytime of year IMO, but shines in the fall/winter.
This was a love at first snif and continues to be one of my most worn easy reach fragrances in my collection.",09/28/24 17:32,Molliundera_

Nomade Chloé,"From a guy's perspective: this juice smells delicious and borderline addictive.

It radiates in the air really nicely and creates a nice scent bubble. It is definitely stronger than a skin scent but still quite intimate in terms of its sillage. Personally, that actually works in its favor and suits the kind of fragrance it is. This isn't boisterous and fighting for attention like a Baccarat Rouge 540, instead this is understated and laid back. There's a calmness and a sense of ""clarity"" in this that I don't often see in modern day female fragrances. Really refreshing.

If I caught the scent trail of this on a woman who passed me by, yeah, I'd be immediately intrigued ;)",09/22/24 12:32,delancy
Nomade Chloé,this is the first scent that has ever smelt addictive to me. I sprayed it on my wrist in the shop and kept coming back for sniffs because it was that good. i love that it has a slight masculine edge with the woody notes underneath the floral it’s so perfect i need a full size asap,09/21/24 10:38,azzle

Today i gave it another shot, and now i can see, it really is the smell of a fairy who lives in the woods. So elegant, so complex, sharp at first but soo rounded well. I’ve probably tested a bad sample, it mightve been exposed to light and oxygen a lot because i remember it being too sour. Actual nomade is whimsical, both mature and young.

Nomade Chloé,"I went traveling recently with a friend of mine and she wore this scent. Instantly I became obsessed with it. She smelled so classy, so fresh and sexy but never too cloying or too much. Just the perfect scent for the summer heat. So as soon as I got the name for the perfume, I got a small 10 ml bottle.

On my skin, this sprays on as a beautiful peach-plum citrus scent. I usually don't like citrus in perfumes as it can very easily turn too ""cleaning product""-like but the citrus in this feels so classy, subtle and natural you can't help but get addicted to it. It's like a fresh glass of lemonade on a hot day. The plum feels juicy enough to bite into.

This dries down to a mossy-freesia-peach on my skin. The patchouli isn't too strong, it lends a subtly thick sweetness to the drydown almost alike to honey. The oakmoss and wood helps keep the fruitiness balanced without leaning masculine.

I'm actually obsessed with this scent. I've almost used up my 10 ml bottle in record time. I've already bought a full bottle of Vanilla 28 this month so I put a perfume buy-ban on myself but I'm strongly tempted to break that ban and buy this 😭",08/26/24 06:30,Helioduros
Nomade Chloé,"Whoever said that this is what you wear if you want to smell like a fairy that's frolicking through the woods?? Correct. Absolutely correct. This is the only perfume I've smelt that can truly be signature scent worthy. You can wear it all year round, day and night, and you won't smell like too many people. Can't wait to get my hands on a full size, it's soooo pretty.",08/22/24 17:14,sezbez124
Nomade Chloé,"Absolute year round day scent. This is my go to office scent. Whenever in doubt, I just spay this and head to the office. Beautiful, long lasting and not offensive at all if you limit yourself to 2-3 sprays per wear.
It feels like this perfume transforms into something completely different every few hours. The opening is very soft and fruity and it settles into a floral scent and finally it very earthy. I'm not saying it's unisex, but the masculine edge in this perfume is beyond elegantly done.

I don't have enough amazing words to say about perfume.",08/22/24 05:03,Bahar__asr
Nomade Chloé,"I slept on this for so long and shouldn’t have. It is such an easy grab, inoffensive, light and airy pretty girl scent. I could definitely see how this could easily become someone’s actual signature, like long after they’re gone, you happen to smell this in public and you will never not think of the person you once knew. I hope that made sense. Really pretty and worthy of a spot in any collection, right next to Chance eau Tendre edt, it’s that type of scent.",08/16/24 13:08,subtlyyours
Nomade Chloé,"this is by far my most complimented fragrance and the most underrated. it is also one of my longer lasting fragrances too. i carry the travel bottle in my bag everywhere i go, my friends fiend for it like a vape. they want a dab any chance they get and rightfully so.

chloe was my introduction to perfumes and nomade is on the more mature feminine side compared to the other fragrances by chloe. lets speak about the notes for a bit, it is a really pretty floral that gives more musk than citrus in my opinion. she is girly but not in a chanel mademoiselle way, in a more forward and mellow-down way where the musk will linger on your skin and leave your clothes smelling delicious. it will LINGER. sniffing the bottle i don't smell that nauseating alcohol bufoonery from most brand name perfumes. instead, its a delicious rosey white floral that is actually so addicting. the little spritz of peach and lemon here and there is actually so nice. almost like a peach rose soda.

if i had to describe nomade in one word: addicting. elegant. i am enamored. i cannot cannot cannot get enough of her. she gets a 10/10. i am a jasmine girl and this combination of peach and jasmine with the wood and musk is exactly what i wanted. i loved nomade in college and i will forever cherish her. if you are in college i believe this is the perfect scent for interviews, meetings, first dates. you will absolutely leave that lasting ""oh wow she smells good"" impression that will have people wanting for more.

i feel as though she is the perfect ingenue, on the outside you get a super sweet girl full of joy but with that je ne sais quoi like you just have to unlock her unravel her piece by piece, and after sitting outside in a cafe after some runny eggs and sourdough and sodas you find you've met your soulmate in a best friend. thats what nomade feels like to me.",08/14/24 11:31,jazmineflwr

Nomade Chloé,"Nomade is one of those fragrances that requires some time, at least that’s the case with me. When I first got this, I felt like it was way too chypre leaning for my taste. I came here to read up on it and try to dissect what was feeling off to me because on paper I should really like this. I came across a review that stated that this smelled like her boyfriend’s deodorant. That hit a chord with me. It didn’t smell like a modern deodorant like Axe, niche-like subscription required ones, or a revamped Old Spice that I am accustomed to smelling on a man now. No, it reminded me of my father’s deodorant. He differentiated between the blue and green Speed Stick deodorants in the 90’s. He always smelled of that, Icy Blast Irish Spring soap, and Joop cologne on special occasions. Essentially, it’s almost exactly what Nomade smells like on my skin. My father was also a flower child of the 1960’s which is incorporated with the patchouli. Trust me, I know it sounds strange and not a lot of women will be sold on the prospect of smelling like their dad but I lost my father going on seven years this month. I definitely appreciate having a tiny piece of him through this scent. This fragrance unlocks the memory of mornings when he would wake me up for school and we would get the opportunity to listen to the Beatles or watch Bozo together before heading off for the day. There’s also components of young me lingering in there with the sweetness of White Rain shampoo and traces of gold bar Dial soap. For me, this is sentimentally special but I do think it’s something a lot of people will connect to and enjoy. Conversely, I acknowledge how people will hate this but it’s something unique that at the very least is worth sampling.

There’s a depth that is acquired as Nomade macerates. The top notes are overtly feminine with the mirabelle, the citrus notes, freesia, jasmine, and rose which are perfectly superimposed over the more masculine notes like oakmoss, patchouli, and the woody bases. I love the androgyny of this scent. Nomade IS indeed a chypre but definitely a diet chypre that’s modernized with just the subtlest suggestion of oakmoss lingering. There is something resinous here but again it’s done with a light hand. After this settles for a few hours, the more masculine chokehold that’s apparent on first spray softens and veers off into typical Chloé territory. The sweet, soapy, and refreshing accords emerge while just the slightest bit spiciness can be detected. It truly is beautiful and a transformative, layered fragrance. Like people have said, this is a powerhouse scent in terms of sillage and longevity.

Side note: I eyed this on Sutton Stracke’s vanity in an episode of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. I didn’t know what to think because I find Sutton to be annoying, obnoxious, overdramatic, and quite possibly the least redeemable of all the Housewives of any franchise. Having said that, I can compartmentalize my personal feelings and say that I do appreciate her Park Avenue meets antebellum aesthetic. It does make sense to me that this scent would appeal to her because it combines vintage and contemporary together as well as it combines genders. Sometimes when I spray this scent on I’m inadvertently hit with a mental callback to her “name ‘em” rant to Kyle which always makes me giggle a little bit. If you’re a fan of that show, you know how bat $hit crazy and unhinged that moment was. If not, Google it because it’s hilarious. It’s second only to Ken screaming, “Goodbye, Kyle” as he ascends the stairs 😂",08/04/24 08:39,DieT CroaK
Nomade Chloé,"It has a beautiful start full of orange and peach. If you will inspect it closely you can imagine notes of mirabelle, lemon, bergamot. Then freesia with its clear, dewy scent, rose, a drop of jasmine and sandalwood-musk frame. A very good scent. Like but maybe closer to love. A pity so many flankers appeared so soon - how to buy or love them all. Nomade Nuit d'Egypt should be the first flanker and only on its release day not to overcrowd this beautiful scent but to keep it as a main focus. It is sensational enough. And universal.

Nomade Chloé,"The let down is in the drydown. I am not one of those people who can love a fragrance for only one of its developmental stages. I need to love you from open to close. And I love Chloe EDP upon introduction. Then she begins to speak and I realize I don’t really love her personality. She’s a little loud and basic.

The opening is so… I can only think of the word “lovely”. But then that peach starts talking so loudly like she wants all the attention on her. And it throws the harmony off.",06/18/24 09:25,SiriusBeauty
Nomade Chloé,"I've been exploring chypres lately--I'm tired of all the fruity musks offerings that seem so popular now. Now, I usually skip designer scents. Nomade is a good lesson for me to not be a perfume snob though--wow.

Quentin Bisch is an all star perfumer, and the first thing I noticed about Nomade is how much it reminds me of Hibiscus Mahajad. There's a minty opening, though, of course, a shifted heart. Two perfumes that might appear as distinct separate movements in the same symphony. I sold Mahajad--it was too loud, too fruity, too awkwardly leather-scented on my skin. Nomade is my girl. She's elegant, chic, complicated, distinct.

More literally, she opens minty and bright, a burst of sweet fruitchuli, lots of peaches with a sandalwood/powder element. It's nicely balanced and younger than Nomade absolu. For me, it's a daytime scent used sparingly in Texas heat. Downsides is this is a strong one--I'm using a half spray, and it projects like a beast.

It's a gorgeous perfume and sings on my skin--it doesn't skew masculine or mature. It's complex, mossy, minty and fruity by turns, changing and whispering at different volumes. For the price point, it's an incredible, new wave chypre.",06/11/24 20:14,emgailba
Nomade Chloé,Collega passed by and smelled amazing and elegant. Nothing like the super sweet cloying fragrances that have been released nowadays. This time I asked because she genuinely smells good but sometimes I ask when someone wears something I dislike too just to spare myself from trying it. I thought she would have been wearing something older or classic and I was seriously surprised when she said its Chloe Nomade. I had never tested Chloe Nomade because I have kind of lost my interest with new releases because they all seemed to smell the same. If this was a singing woman she would be someone with deeper voice and mature. I want to go and try this on my skin because it smells so good.,06/09/24 11:41,Laurus

Nomade Chloé,"Chloe Nomade is such a rich, warm yet fruity scent that I always get compliments on. It does have some masculine qualities, so I recommend this if you love more feminine scents that aren’t too sweet but still make you smell pretty. My favorite way to layer is with VS Honey lotion/oil as it compliments the sweetness and warmth, but this scent is such a beautiful scent all in its own. I definitely agree that this is a great scent for every day wear, no matter the season, and you definitely get your money’s worth with how well it performs.

Nomade Chloé,"I tend to be a Quentin Bische fan except when his fragrances include rose. This one isn't very rose-forward, but it's still not anything I like. I see a lot of reviews talking about the complexity and how it changes over time, but for me, it smells extremely simple and keeps the same simple note until it fades away. I can imagine it as a bathroom spray or maybe a body wash scent. It's really not something I want to smell like every day. There's a part of it that reminds me of what I don't like in Libre, too. It seems very jasmine- and freesia-forward. Overall, I'm just not a fan. Luckily, it faded down to almost nothing in about an hour. I tried wearing it again just to make sure I wasn't missing something after reading all these glowing reviews, but it's just not for me and it's not going to grow on me.",05/16/24 09:45,amnebe
Nomade Chloé,"I am not a big chypre lover as oakmoss can so easily be too sour if not carefully balanced. Nomade, however, is! This is a very well balanced and blended, refined, elegant chypre and whereas the oakmoss is still the most prominent note, the rest of the blend with florals and mirabelle is keeping it in a lovely balance. Not sweet, not sour but just right - elegant and many faceted. A very elegant fragrance. Gorgeous bottle and presentation also.",05/16/24 05:12,Frangipanilove
Nomade Chloé,"Gorgeous, thoroughly modern chypre!

Aptly named - opens with a citrus like blast and a hint of soft pine which dries down to a fresh, fruity accord - I assume this is the mirabelle plum/peachy notes - it's not heavy or deep peach - more sparkly and transient - floats around, there's a lightness from perhaps the freesia - all circling the woods, patchouli and moss before combining into the most beautifully grounded dry down I've encountered for a long time in any new release.

It's elegant but welcoming. It's playful, indulgent & cheerful but also personable and steady at the same time.
Takes you on an olfactory journey of discovery before leading you into a sense of belonging - a homecoming if you will.

Stays present for a full 24hrs. Sillage is good for the first 3-4 hrs with a normal 4 spray application. After around 4 hrs, becomes slightly more intimate but still very noticeable within arms reach. Can still be noticed as skin scent after a full 24hrs.

This really is beautiful.
As others have noted - smells very different on test strip - if you do want to buy this - test on skin and give a full wear before making your mind up.",05/14/24 04:08,Munro Bagger
Nomade Chloé,"What the heck?? This perfume smells completely different to me than it does on paper. On the test strip I get rose, cinnamon, orange, amber and jasmine - divine!

Nomade Chloé,"This the most unique chypre fragrance in my collection. This is what I reach for when I’m tired of vanillas and basic florals. She’s elegant, sexy and long lasting. This is sexy in an old money kind of way, it’s not something you would wear to go clubbing. It is spicy in the opening and I believe that’s due to the mirabelle, but it fades into the most luxurious peachy oakmoss scent. I can understand why people think this smells like a hippie, but I’ve always thought that it smells like a very expensive department store that’s impeccably clean and organized. It’s feminine to my nose, I wouldn’t want my husband to smell like this. I got in the car with my aunt after a few sprays and she asked why it smelled like cologne all the sudden (she wears Victoria Secret) so I wouldn’t overspray if you’re going to be within close proximity to others for a long period of time. I love the original Chloe fragrance but I highly recommend this if you want something a bit more unique.",05/07/24 10:53,judearose123
Nomade Chloé,"I'm a man and I find this perfume is the most beautiful scent I ever smelled.
The way Musk and Jasmine goes through the Roses and Orange is just pure & perfection.

I use this perfume at summer nights when I'm out with friends as I'm a male I don't think I can wear it at day and work.
This perfume to me is a therapy, I just do two sprays whenever I'm not in the mood and it always finds a way to make me feel great.",04/29/24 01:49,Abdulaziiz
Nomade Chloé,"This beautiful scent was a love at first sniff. I'm a sucker for plum notes and Chloe Nomade has such a bright, juicy plum heart that's elegant, flirty, and alluring. The opening of this fragrance is a gorgeous blend of all the citrus top notes which blend together to almost smell like a freshly-squeezed cup of citrus juices, more sweet than zesty. As the citrus notes fade, the heart of rose and jasmine really come forward—with the peach adding a juicy edge. The entire lifetime of the fragrance is supported by a smooth, creamy woods base accompanied with a soft musky facet, a tinge of greenness from a smooth and earthy patchouli, and a slightly scratchy distinct oakmoss.

If you're a femme who dislike oakmoss or think it automatically makes a fragrance masculine, Nomade is absolutely going to be a no for you. But personally, Nomade taught me how oakmoss could be used to add a confident, earthy, head-turning edge to a perfume. All of the notes come together to create a perfectly-sweet, juicy and fruity floral fragrance with an extremely long-lasting musky-woodsy moss base. Probably 1-2 hours of 1m projection, then another 2-3 of 1 foot projection, but lasts on your clothes 8+ hrs at intimate distances.

This would be a fantastic signature scent and is appropriate for just about every season but winter, where she would be better replaced by her older and richer sister, the now-discontinued Nomade Absolu de Parfum. Would be a head-turning but still safe daily reach which could fit the office just as well as running errands or a little cafe date. Probably a little bright and peppy to be a good nighttime scent as well.

This is a hidden gem from Chloe and deserves more love. I'll probably always keep a bottle of this or the Absolu in my collection.",04/27/24 19:51,EmberFloofs
Nomade Chloé,"What a beautiful rich scent, sweet mirabelle and fresh citrus delight, faint flowers and rich woody base, slightly unisex, distinguished, extremely long lasting, 10 hours+ and stays strong on my skin, can become cloying after a while, should not be oversprayed, especially in warmer weather. What a discovery! Better later than never as this one is a rare gem. I like it a lot, I will definitely repurchase a bigger bottle in the future.",04/27/24 15:43,Elyka21

Nomade Chloé,"It’s very strange. On one hand, it has some “rich” notes that make you feel beautiful, on the other hand, though, smells like deodorant/air refresher.

Don’t feel it much throughout the day, feels like it doesn’t last long.
Also, don’t feel like it has very little trace. Have never been complemented for it.

Even though for other, I would get it at least noticed.",04/26/24 11:17,SashaBo
Nomade Chloé,"This perfume is unlike other Chloe fragrances; it's a unique scent. It combines woody and fresh notes simultaneously, making it very long-lasting and, in my opinion, one of the best designer perfumes to have come out in recent years. It's a scent that could suit anyone. Additionally, I always receive compliments whenever I wear it. I believe it's suitable for all ages.",04/25/24 06:53,SultanBaşar
Nomade Chloé,"For the first half-hour, it gives the impression of eating one of those peach candies with acidulated sugar on top (surely the citrus in the top note), but next to the toilet where your little sister would have sprayed on the air freshener (a smell that freesia usually evokes for me).

Then it becomes more distinguished, with the deodorant aspect fading and giving way to jasmine and a slightly powdery rose, with oakmoss making a timid appearance.

Finishes a few hours later on a very feminine rose and musky base that leaves you feeling clean and fresh.

Not as unisex as some comments suggest, I find it too feminine on me.

Nomade Chloé,This is a sweeter and more musky version of Coco Noir- I have samples of both right now and the similarities are obvious.

Nomade Chloé,"I felt a deep resonance the very first time I sprayed ✨️Nomade✨️ in a store. It stood out completely amidst the sea of gourmands and fruity-florals. It instantly grabbed my attention, and I knew I had to have it. 🤎

Nomade stands out from the crowd, just like a non-conformist authentic woman who can't be contained in one box. 💫 Unique and empowering. Modern and vintage simultaneously. A mix of class and a little bit of ""dirt."" A walking contradiction that's earthy, yet elegant. Complex and androgynous. Confidently sexy and heavy with mood.

Nomade Chloé,"Chloe Nomade is a very interesting chypre perfume, in which I particularly enjoy the delicious fruity notes. However, on me it quickly becomes very soapy and the soapiness overwhelms the other aspects of the fragrance.",03/16/24 10:28,celestial
Nomade Chloé,"Wow, I dismissed this one when I first tried it in store. Years later, I smelt something a little like it and I retried it. I ended up buying a bottle. Fast forward a few years more and I am very close to finishing it. It's become one of my go to work fragrances.

This is citrussy, to me mainly bergamot and oakmoss fragrance, if you struggle with the almost soapy bitterness that oakmoss brings then you might not enjoy this. The slightly soapy feel is enhanced by the freesia, which is sensed as yet more soapiness, and there is certainly some peach, which is the warm peach skin kind rather than the juicy kind. In the drydown, this smells like all of the above but with a touch of fresh rose.

It's pretty and stands out because it's different. It's like a more modern Coco Mademoiselle in a way. Certainly one of the best designer fragrances of the 2010s for me. Long lasting and projects too, I know because I've had compliments on it. I'm tempted to repurchase this one, but I have a huge collection which I am trying to reduce, so perhaps not yet.",03/14/24 02:06,qofb

Nomade Chloé,"Smells like a very pleasant and basic chypre ( my phone’s autocorrect changed that to coyote which made me laugh, now that would be an interesting perfume) on first spray. After about an hour though the notes kind of divided on me and I would get a fruity peach interspersed with occasional strong wafts of what I can only describe as pine tree. It was interesting, but overall although there’s nothing offensive about this it also doesn’t really merit a purchase.",03/06/24 10:10,2bClare

Nomade Chloé,"Chloé Nomade has mass appeal written all over it. A lightweight, fresh floral-fruity with a barely-there chypre base, housed in a chic bottle that perfectly reflects the boho nonchalance of the brand, it is an easy, everyday feminine perfume.

Nomade opens with bright citrus, fresh but underscored by peachy sweetness, perhaps initially thanks to the mirabeau. It is sheer and lightweight, paving the way nicely to the sweet freesia-led floral heart. Sweet and aquatic initially, it becomes slightly powdery as it progresses and the clean jasmine emerges.

Powdery rose unfurls on my skin as it begins to dry down, fittingly coming to the fore as the patchouli emerges. The chypre base is mostly due to the patchouli, with some soft woods adding body. It becomes cleanly musky as it fades. Sillage and longevity are moderate.

A competently-composed scent, Nomade is a breezy spring/summer daytime scent, decidedly feminine in my opinion. It is noughties in style, and quite unmemorable, interchangeable with the myriad designer floral-fruities/fruitchoulis of that time despite its recent release date. Safe, versatile and pleasant, Nomade is ideal for gifting, but is ultimately unexciting. 3/5.",03/05/24 11:00,Enrium
Nomade Chloé,"Revisiting: it is divine. Fall-like/hobby lobby spices, soft patchouli, sparkling fruits, and a bit of the OG Sunflowers perfume!

Nomade Chloé,"Nomade is amazing. It’s what I would call a bright chypre. I understand the comparison to Coco Mademoiselle.
But, there is just something to this which blends perfectly with my chemistry. It starts out with a citrus mixed with a woody smell.
The dry down is warm and comforting, yet very classic. I don’t know how this doesn’t get more love. It suits me perfectly.
A 40-something, professional, who likes luxury, but it also pragmatic and slightly bohemian. I have never smelled this on another female ever and I hope it stays that way. When I wear this people ask me what it is.

Nomade Chloé,"Was gifted this mistakenly by my dad who thought he was buying me the Naturelle/Jasmin Naturel version which I love. Unfortunately he got it wrong, and this is so different to the natural version which I'm surprised they called Nomade at all really. I can't think of anything to say about this for now other than the fact this smells like a perfume. It is like the quintessential perfume smell. It smells like a stereotypical woman. Not in a bad way at all.

I don't know what it is that makes me so confused by these types of smells. I can only smell one thing and am incapable of discerning different notes. I wish I could work out which note/combination of notes does this to me. It just smells like a cloud of perfume that's not pretending to be anything other than that. My scent receptors get blasted and over saturated by one of the notes and they stop working. It's very sharp. I'm just not built to appreciate it I suppose. I get this with other perfumes like Chanel Chance original and Coco Mademoiselle, the og miss dior formulation and more. I don't understand how people sing their praise.

I don't dislike it particularly but it might as well not be there as far as I'm concerned, I don't get much enjoyment from it.

It had a different vibe :) Bright, fruity, slightly sweet opening and a nice grounding oakmossy drydown. Light and crisp but last on my skin for a good while.

Nomade Chloé,"After smelling niche perfumes for a while, I really wanted to go back in time and smell those kind of perfumes my Mom used to use when I was younger. Those tender smells, though mature, where you could smell the sweet maturity of citric and sweet, but with that background of sweet make up at the back waiting for you in a Mom's hug. I missed it so much I was imagining this kind of smell and something in my everyday thought brought me to Nomade which I once smelled in a store. I have it now and I cant stop being back in those days when there where so many beautiful and original smells in the market, not overly sweet like this one (catch me, noah, amour amour, flower, etc....) this is a modern vintage perfectly equilibrated perfume that you can wear everyday, and has that mature but sexy, very elegant sense to it. In addittion the name cannot be more perfect, ""Nomade"" I can easily imagine a woman that moves and grow from place to place being just her beautiful self. I am in love.",02/01/24 05:32,mpazrl7

I sprayed the purfume at 7am before leaving for work and could still smell it on my wrists at 9pm.",01/18/24 13:32,Greengate
Nomade Chloé,"Definitely my new favourite!! Gets me lots of compliments and people asking me what fragrance I'm wearing <3 When I was first gifted this fragrance it was very harsh and I wasn't too fond of it but on clothing and skin I found that it was sweeter than my first impressions from spraying into the air/on a tester paper. I can really smell more white florals, woodsy and peachy notes once it dries down - I don't notice too much citrus and generally I'm not fond of citrusy/lemony smells but thankfully on me it dries down beautifully.

Staying power is quite long lasting (after a full day it still lingers on my clothing) and can be smelled from an arm's length away which I enjoy - I want it to be noticeable but not overwhelming, I like a more intimate sillage. All in all so gorgeous, makes me feel sophisticated lol",01/18/24 07:52,quuaach
Nomade Chloé,"I thought this would be exquisite, but it just wasn't my experience. I believe this one is very sensitive to body chemistry, because on some people, it smells absolutely angelic: blooming into a fresh and airy bouquet of flowers and citrus fruit. I stopped a woman to ask her what she was wearing, because she smelled like heaven. I recognized the bergamot note. She said that this was her signature frag. I went to test immediately. When tested on paper and my skin, it smells like Calgon Freesia body spray. It's borderline air freshener. Harsh, synthetic, astringent and screechy. Spraying it on my clothing did not change anything. It just never bloomed for me. For the price, you could just buy Calgon Freesia and get the same smell for much cheaper.",01/10/24 16:52,Astaria_Rex
Nomade Chloé,"I tried this from a sample. It starts as a strong fruity floral, and I can't identify which fruits (maybe the mirabelle and bergamot). They're well-combined with the floral, mostly the freesia and jasmine. It quickly became a bit powdery, while still maintaining the strength of the previous fruits and florals. At 1.5 hours, it had changed to include more oakmoss and a little sandalwood and was more intimate (i.e., fading. I never got any patchouli, musk, or amber wood. By 2 hours, it was almost completely gone.

Overall, it's pretty and inoffensive and light. It's not a FB buy for me due to the lack of performance. It didn't seem innovative or original, although it was really well-blended and a good daily wear. Disappointed.",01/10/24 15:52,mitchyworld
Nomade Chloé,"I find Nomade quite fruity and sweet, even compared to other standard department store offerings. It's powdery, stodgy, and artificial on me. Quite loud, a bit of a cacophony.",01/09/24 10:29,lemonsandroses
Nomade Chloé,"If I was reviewing this based on just the notes, it would be an epic win. It opens with a citrus burst that is somehow not too fruity, then transforms into a softer but not delicate floral before settling into the most exotic and lovely woody, musky scent. It's feminine without being girly and something about it just screams female empowerment. I imagine it's how Charlize Theron's character in Mad Max: Fury Road would smell. Yes, she is gorgeous but she'll also kick your ass. The scent itself is truly to die for. But sadly, I have to consider longevity and, on me at least, this was gone far too quickly. It settled into a skin scent within the hour and I can barely find it on my clothes. At a different price point I would just reapply and call it a win, but for the money, I would expect it to last. It saddens me to my core that this didn't have the staying power to match the glory of the juice.",01/09/24 08:48,jadepo21
Nomade Chloé,"Very happy with it. On me, compared to the EDT, I find it a little less sweet, more woody, more powdery, citrus is a bit louder, and plum a bit quieter. I'd say it is more mature, slightly less feminine, less linear, and has a more intimate sillage. They are still both very mossy/patchouli and similar.

I like them both. The EDT smells like a sweet Christmas tree/moss bomb to me, but this is more like walking through a fancy house that has a big Christmas tree in it somewhere.",01/06/24 18:23,Rosy Ricecooker

Nomade Chloé,"I’ve worn Nomade EDP for years. Every time I go to spray it I’m excited to wear it still.

I despise patchouli, I can detect its presence even after the person wearing it has left the room. But praise be, the alleged patchouli note is nowhere to be found when I wear it. Nomade tends to quickly settle into an amber-y/musky (with a TINY squeeze of citrus on top that cuts thru the musk just enough to add a freshness and femininity), projecting and LASTING scent on me. The obvious citrusy freshness and mild florals that come with the initial moment of application is not at all what it’s like for the rest of the day. Also I can smell it still on a scarf that’s been in the closet since last year. Potent!

Those citrusy-earthy-fresh notes are ALL that come thru on my coworker who also wears it, none of the amber or musk or patchouli. So highly advise to try before buying as mileage varies.",01/04/24 17:46,brutals

Love Story Chloé,"On a quest to find the best and most interesting neroli/orange blossoms fragrance (decently priced), I have decided recently to purchase a bottle of 2014’s Chloe Love Story. Some people say in the comments that it’s been discontinued, but from my experience seems to be available to purchase, in some countries at least.

I am not going to lie, it’s not what I’d expect from seeing the notes. My bottle offers a fairly strong rose and blackcurrant dominant white floral perfume. Also, with a note like stephanotis, which I have not encountered in any perfume so far, I expected something more unique smelling. It delivers that!

And it’s not your typical fresh, green, soapy neroli/ orange blossoms perfume. It’s that but it’s also lots of blackcurrants, rose, peach, pear, grapefruit and some woods. It’s smooth, very fruity, slightly powdery and a tad spicy.

Smells more syrupy sweet than fresh or citrusy to me, not sickly sweet though, and almost in equal parts, fruity and floral. It’s definitely not like any of my other white floral centric perfumes, but smells very good and seems pretty long lasting, which I love in any perfume!

I have blind bought it but I wouldn’t recommend to any lady blind buying it if they want your standard neroli, orange blossom perfume. Love Story is more nuanced, complex and sweet than that! And if you’re not a fan of blackcurrants, I’d say stay away from Love Story…

But I am happy to own a bottle of this! It’s something else.

Edit: very long lasting on clothing. It’s next day late in the afternoon and I still can smell it on my sweatshirt.",09/16/25 05:51,Maya lilac

Love Story Chloé,"Beautiful white floral fragrance, albeit a little overpriced for its longevity. This one doesn't seem to last longer than a few hours. I also don't think this one projects too well, either-- I've yet to receive any comments when I wear it, and I often find I'm burying my nose into my pulse to trace any scent of it not long after applying.

Still, there's a timelessness to this one-- probably one of my newest favorites for spring and summer, and maybe even early autumn, when it's still warm out. The bottle is also adorable.

As others have mentioned, this one is very safe. Clean. Modest. Elevated. I instantly understood why others were saying it's a wedding perfume. A long-wear absolu version of this EDP would perfect the concept.

Love Story Chloé,"It is a romantic, dewy and clean floral with intimate sillage. Sure, someone hugging you will feel it, but with this intimate sillage I cannot really feel the edp on myself, only with my wrist close, it does not carry on the air. The deodorant has better sillage. It is beautiful though.
As a scent it is perfectly balanced, not too floral, not too watery, the fruits only enhance the neroli and orange blossom, but both are in low volume. The scent is perfect for spring and summer and very bridal, if the lady does not want to be the centre of attention because of her scent. I like it a lot, I must try to overspray this, maybe I will feel it around me.
2-3 hours and it is pretty much gone, making me miss it and I am spraying it again. So pretty and so fleeting.
Going to sleep I felt subtle floral scent on me, I think I was not imagining it :) If so, then the longevity would not be so bad, the sillage however close to no existent. It might be better for summer, it is so crisp.",04/21/25 04:56,MademoiselleMaya

To the opening there is the freshness of amalfi lemon and neroli, other subtle white florals make their appearance - adding to the pure freshness rather than detracting. Cashmeran and cedar introduce a feeling of luxury to this fragrance, but then again, everything is subtle, soft, and lovely. Although this is not my preferred scent profile and I am yet to find a Chloé fragrance I would personally wear, I know I'd enjoy smelling someone else smell this way. A like for the books.",03/03/25 08:10,Lotte_Liese
Love Story Chloé,"I have received this perfume as a gift and while I initially didn't like it that much, it has really grown on me. It smells like an everything shower after a yoga session, tulips in a crystal vase on a sunlit marble countertop, stolen glances and soft laughter on romantic dates, chiffon curtains billowing in the afternoon light, the delicate sweetness of dewdrops on fresh petals, the weightless embrace of a lace dress twirling in a field of wildflowers.",02/13/25 16:01,espressovanilla
Love Story Chloé,"I used to wear this in high school so it has such a nostalgic scent for me. Its bright, sweet, and very youthful. Superrrr feminine and, though i'm not sure I would wear it as a now adult, I still love it. Definitely a fun year-round perfume.",02/09/25 12:08,sc0tty2th0tty
Love Story Chloé,"Love Story blooms on skin first with this golden sweetness, like brown pears left to ripen just a little too long, their sticky yet refreshing juice golden and sun-warmed. There’s honeysuckle too, lazy and soft, curling around the edges, giving the opening this dreamy, overripe feel. Then, out of nowhere, the neroli peeks through—not shy, but not abrupt either—clean and a little bitter-sweet, like stepping into the shade for a quick soap-down after basking in warmth. It starts to feel a tad sharper, fresher, reminiscent of VCA's Neroli Amara, but with that musky, cashmere softness still clinging to it, grounding everything in something intimate and comforting. This is sweet, sunlit skin slowly cooling in the evening breeze.",01/23/25 02:55,luvoxlixir
Love Story Chloé,Woody but not woody masculine. Its a very feminine fragrance. I have read somewhere that it smells like a wedding bouquet of flowers and I totally agree. Its a real love story.,01/17/25 18:28,Fadwa0204!!
Love Story Chloé,"Something about that white floral and citrus is so perfect

A very sour perfume that gives it a great level of sophistication

Although it is very fresh I would not categorise this as a summer perfume, i thinks is too sharp, however its perfect for the spring

I’m not sure what it is about it but i think this fragrance would be perfect in a work setting",01/09/25 09:25,0rchid.tree
Love Story Chloé,"Wow, this girl is an enigma. She starts with such a burst of white florals that you think maybe she is outdated and mature. Then she surprises you with citrus so that you realize she is youthful, but maybe a little sharp. After a bit, a soapy freshness emerges and you think you have landed on an answer, she’s a clean girl. But more time passes and this woodiness comes through that makes you think she’s unisex and earthy at the end of the day. Finally, her energy gives out and she’s a little generic but still lovely in an uptown girl kind of way.

Still not sure if I like her, if she’s my style, but I appreciate her journey. I will come back to this one in Springtime to see if that’s her happy place.",01/03/25 11:15,jadepo21
Love Story Chloé,"I normally identify this as the ""clean girl' perfume of my collection.

It's white florals with musk. It almost leans unissex but I find it more feminine.

It's casual chic, it's clean and pretty and you can't go wrong with it.

Might not be for those who seek strong emotions in their perfume but it's a wonderful bet for office wear and if you want to smell clean and elegant on daily life.",12/21/24 19:15,Moonlightmuse
Love Story Chloé,"this is a nice sweet floral, but maybe it’s a little too woody and spicy. i don’t really think that the notes fully work together, because when i smell it it smells like floral rootbeer or something. not my cup of tea, but it smells so much better on other people. it might be my body chemistry, gourmands just perform way better on me. the great thing about this is it’s definitely strong and it definitely lasts. other people can smell it and even i can still smell it after hours. i think this one isn’t one ill be wearing a whole lot, as people seem to like this less than the other perfumes i wear, but i think something about this doesn’t work for me.",12/07/24 18:30,myadbest
Love Story Chloé,it is a lovely perfume. very elegant and clean. almost too elegant like you won't be able to smell it on yourself after 20 minutes. it just goes away...,12/03/24 05:40,gizzyco
Love Story Chloé,"I love all the Chloe fragrances and really wanted to like this. The initial citrus/ neroil burst is pleasant but this Love Story soon settles into a pretty generic floral which on my skin takes on an unpleasant rotting bouquet note like the smell of flower stems left too long in the vase. I'm not sure what causes this, maybe the stephanotis, but it does not make me want to keep spritzing! Thankfully its longevity is not that of Chloe EDP or Nomade EDP",11/27/24 12:48,smellycat12
Love Story Chloé,"I had high hopes for this fragrance because people said it's the smell of first love and I don't quite see it. It's not a bad smell, it's just a little blank in my opinion. Nothing too special, nothing that someone would notice. It reminded me a little bit of Dior J'adore when it starts to evaporate. I don't know if the sample in the store was rotten or something, but I only got the white florals and the sour notes. I didn't smell any orange blossom (which I love so much in scents), neither rose, pear or blackcurrant. I usually pick up perfumes that I'm obsessed with and for the first time that's not the case. I think it's missing a little vanilla and that would automatically make it a BOMB smell. And this is ironic coming from me because I never choose vanilla or caramel as a note on my fragrances, but I think it would be needed here to break the sourness and white florals with a little sweetness. Maybe it's the sample though.. I also find it to be a very winter and a summer scent but not a in between seasons fragrance. But that's just me.",11/27/24 01:25,In_love_like_a_rose
Love Story Chloé,"This has Chloe DNA but toned down the softer Chloe let's the white florals come out and there is addition of citrus.
Initially it's strong and a bit fuzzy to the nose so don't over do it. After 30 minutes it's a citrus jasmine wrapped in something cashmere like..comforting yet fresh. It's very feminine and brings to mind a natural beauty, minimal makeup, ponytail and she wears pretty cardigans or jean shorts, crisp white t-shirt, sandals and she somehow looks sophisticated. It's appropriate for many occasions...just don't overspray. I use a spray to each wrist, one on the chest and it's plenty.",11/22/24 14:37,Mwils

Love Story Chloé,"such a youthful fragrance, sunshine in a bottle! opens with a sweet grapefruit nectar in my skin that quickly is embraced by neroli with a tint of greenery, this creates a balanced citrus-sweet opening which is quite summery and joyful to me. in the drydown i get the orange blossom, its whiteness complemented by a honeyed tint. that all falls into a musk and cashmere cocoon, so you get that kinda soapy clean and soft orange blossom beautiful aura. it is polite in its performance, lasting a lot on my skin and those who actually get closer to you will experience this pristine halo of summery bliss.",09/29/24 07:52,dreamypeony
Love Story Chloé,"A nice, clean, fresh and green citrus-floral. Sophisticated and inoffensive. I wish that the fruity burst that it opens with stayed but that’s just personal preference and the musky, woody dry down is nice in its own way.

For me it’s perfect for a rainy spring day (but not exclusively!) and these days at a decent price.

*EDIT* …after a while it settles into a very soapy scent. A lovely, luxurious soap but soapy nonetheless! But hey, it’s nice to smell clean! I’d say it’s a pretty safe work fragrance.",09/25/24 14:48,wuddalooo
Love Story Chloé,"It is hard to find summer fragrances that smell mysterious without being headache-inducing, and Chloe absolutely nailed it with this one. It smells fresh, sexy, summery, and feminine, and it has an addicting and mysterious appeal to it. Usually when summer fragrances try to be sexy and mysterious, I get the vibe that they don't know what they want to be when I smell them. Love Story knows what it is and it is a perfect fragrance for a summer date night.",09/15/24 19:59,caro.mil
Love Story Chloé,"A flower bomb that smells lovely on first snif, but dries as an overpowering black currant musky rose hell on me after a few a few hours.

Love Story Chloé,"I put this on last night before bedtime and wow I love it so much! It was unexpected because I tried this YEARS ago, liked it, bought a bottle, and promptly forgot about it. For some reason, I remembered it as kind of boring?? Either my nose has developed more since then, or I was just wrong, because this is NOT boring! It is clean white florals with a little bit of sweetness. My husband immediately said it reminded him of laundry detergent and I get that comparison too! It reminds me of laying on clean white sheets with the windows open, on vacation in Santorini, with the sunshine streaming in, seeing the cloudless blue sky and hearing the water outside.",08/21/24 07:28,marygracefelton
Love Story Chloé,"My Favourite fragrance till now,

What makes it special for me, the mixing of orange, neroli, mesk, white flowers and cedar woods, mix of feelings with clean, fresh, Classy, Gentleness, romance, calm, Dreamer and fiminine lady.

I adore how it can change my hole mood and I didn't smell any dupe of it before. this perfume suitable for any time and any season, Your wedding, after shower or during the day. 5 star to it and I recommended to own it even if you think to buy it blind buy or like the clean fresh calm perfumes. It lasts 12 hours on the leather and one day on the clothes. Note: from Shower to shower I was smelling the perfume on my skin again.

Love Story Chloé,"Quite pretty and demure....Quintessential Spring!
Would have a difficult time believing someone would find this scent off putting. The neroli and citrus help keep this super bright and light (a bit too light for my liking) but the longevity and sillage are abysmal. This might be a good starter perfume for a younger person...like in their tweens.
Overall...
Scent- 7/10
Longevity - 4/10 (got about 3-4 hours of wear)
Sillage - 3/10",03/23/24 04:04,Snob Smells
Love Story Chloé,"This is one of my favourite fragrances. Opens with a beautiful burst of orange blossom. Has the DNA of the original Chloe, however the orange blossom softens the fragrance and brings a touch of freshness and femininity.

I wear this throughout the year as I love this so much. Though the fragrance will wear beautifully in warmer months.
I can see this being a perfect scent for a bride on her wedding day.",02/06/24 07:45,JoeyA
Love Story Chloé,"To me this is a soft and understated perfume. Maybe a good signature scent for someone who wants a discreet scent. The citrus is beautiful and light, the white flowers are beautiful and light. Under that I pick up a faint rose. Not a love for me, but I am using it up when I am craving citrus. If you want this but more, juicier and with a wow-factor: the Versaces ”Eros Femme Eau de Toilette” or ”Yellow Diamond Intense”, thank me later.",01/30/24 06:37,IngridYlva
Love Story Chloé,"A gorgeous, elegant, feminine, romantic, fresh floral. On me it’s a beautiful, soft, white floral scent that’s lightly sweet, and has a touch of bright, clean, fresh citrus. The florals are delicate, as if they just freshly opened. The base notes of musk, fresh cedar, warm cashmirwood, and patchouli become more prominent, but still subtle during the dry down. The cedar adds a lovely, slightly sweet, fresh woody scent. I don’t typically overly like patchouli, but in this I do. There’s just a touch of it, so it’s not too spicy, and it really accentuates the other base notes well.

Love Story really is the perfect name for this fragrance. This is one of the most romantic and elegant freshly floral fragrances that I own. I especially enjoy wearing this in the springtime. I’m not typically overly drawn to florals, but I do really love this one. For reference, some of the other ones I love are Coach Love (2012 version), Coach Poppy Blossom, Coach Poppy Wild Flower, Chloe, Flowerbomb, FB Ruby Orchid, FB Nectar, and FB Midnight.

I typically get great longevity with my fragrances, and Love Story is no exception… it lasts the entire day. The projection is nice too, it radiates out about an arm’s length from me.",01/22/24 23:35,Shimmer412
Love Story Chloé,"Clean, Powdery & Delicate Floral...

The opening comes on strong with a clean, powdery & citrus-y neroli, but already the Chloe DNA is swelling through. As it transitions to the heart, it softens with white-florals & orange-blossom that help to continue the clean vibe that gets fluffier, while the Chloe DNA remains in the background with rose, peach & patchouli. The base notes, especially musk, help to continue the powdery, clean & fluffy effect. I currently just have a sample of this, although I had a bottle back in 2014 which I regrettably gave away. When I first got this, I found it too powdery & clean, but now as I'm testing it from the sample I'm appreciating it's delicate beauty. Projects a lot at first, but then settles into a delicate clean floral vibe that sweetens the longer it's on the skin. This one has won me over. It's a love for me. Enjoy!",01/15/24 08:00,suzanne_ronald
Love Story Chloé,"I got this for Christmas, I can't believe I slept on this for so long! It's absolutely stunning! An extremely clean, fresh laundry, clean girl vibe. Extremely feminine. Perfect for weddings or work or just a day out shopping. Love at first sniff! However......🤔 The performance is not good on me at all. Within a half hour I could barely smell it. Within a hour it had completely gone from my clothes. This was one of those rare times the fragrance lasted on my skin longer than it did on my clothes. By the hour it was a skin scent only and by 90 mins it had completely gone! Which is a shame because this could have been a signature worthy scent for me. It is truly beautiful, sadly I have EDTs that last longer.",12/27/23 01:08,anjunakerry
Love Story Chloé,"i love that the patchouli notes in this aren't super overwhelming, it's actually a super nice and sweet touch. the opening notes of orange blossom and neroli seem to linger around for a pretty long time, but once it dries down it gives a soft sweetness, almost vanilla-ey powder vibe. i really like this perfume, i heard the sensuelle version is supposed to be an overall softer version of love story, so i'd really love to try that some time.",12/26/23 13:30,snowangeline
Love Story Chloé,"Fresh, delicate, sweet florals with a citrus punch, perfectly inoffensive, not terribly original, but a beautiful, crisp, elegant fragrance nonetheless. It's a safe blind buy. As it develops, I smell some kind of pepopery, spiced rose. It's very pretty.

It's not super deep or seductive, it's more light, femenine, and airy.

Sillage and lasting power aren't terribly impressive, unfortunately. Usually lasts about 2 hours on me.

I like it, it's lovely. Sometimes fragrances don't need to be earth-shattering or super original to be good.",11/15/23 16:12,sashazor

This is definitely going to be a scent for a woman getting married or just someone who enjoys that classy, crisp, not in your face kinda scent. You can smell the rose, jasmin and the perfect hint of citrus to make it fresh.

Love Story Chloé,"love story chloeThis is a nice white floral, I can see why it's a popular scent, but I think it's just okay, *i like it better after a few hours, a spiciness develops and some more rose). I cant really distinguish the notes, but luckily i don't get the gross peach scent that other perfumes have.  it's not a white floral like Curious Britney Spears, it smells more like a yellow floral, but it does smell very fresh like a real flower. It kind of reminds me of the Dior Rose n Roses, bc it has a real flower smell, but I actually don't like it as much as I thought I would. I think it would be worn any time of year, bc it's floral it'd probably be better during the day. arm's length to 6 feet, but fades some. Femme and good for women 25-100+ years old. I think the bottle is beautiful, but it is WAYYYY overpriced at $220 for a 75ml!!!! Those are some Tom Ford prices! On discount sites, it is still $115 for 75ml! This perfume could easily be replicated for much much cheaper. I wouldn't but or keep it if gifted. A perfume like Miss Dior Absolutely Blooming (although they don't smell alike) has more longevity and sillage. more pepper/sweetness/rose floral.",09/26/23 10:34,natasha28

Love Story Chloé,"Very late to this party but happy I got here. I love this. It's really feminine and yet tailored. So you could be at a wedding or a formal luncheon but you could also just be wearing jeans and your favorite tailored white shirt. Crisp citruses and juicy pear, a bit sharp - the florals moving in with neroli as the star and settling in to a lovely clean musk - but not the overpowering laundry musk of some of the more recent releases. No vanilla, no syrup, no patchouli. Because it does not have the notes I just listed it smells ""newer"" than a lot of the latest releases. Can I already be tired of rose? Well yes I am. And it's not here, so again this makes it smell more original than most of the new releases I just tested. This perfume is not ""challenging"" but it is definitely pretty. Perfect for work this spring and summer and that is exactly how I plan to use it.",04/05/23 07:14,2lipsinHolland
Love Story Chloé,"This perfume opens up so vibrant, fresh and inviting with the citrus and pear. I'm beginning to realize that I'm very inclined to like perfumes that open up with pear in the top notes. It's perfumey but in the best way possible to me. It gives a level of sharpness that I love. I'm usually not a fan of patchouli unless it's done right and not overwhelming, which it is not in this fragrance. While wearing this, I envision myself somewhere in Paris during summer vacation with the windows open as the breeze from the citrus garden lightly flows through the drapes. I absolutely love this fragrance and It will always remain in my collection 😍",04/04/23 16:03,ReeReeLove
Love Story Chloé,"Very similar to Yellow Diamonds Intense by Versace. Chloe Love Story is beautiful and I can't imagine many would say it doesn't smell good even if it wasn't their type of scent. It has that ever so slightly metallic synthetic element you get from all Chloe scents. I love the blend of pear, white flowers and fruity musk. Yellow Diamond Intense has almost identical notes but it is less sharp with a softer ambery base. Regretfully both don't project on me at all. No one can smell me even with multiple sprays on both wrists and sides of the neck. I only owned one bottle and never repurchased because I don't need anymore skin scents.",04/02/23 19:54,perfumelovere

Love Story Chloé,"This is developing into a Love Story for me (Husband Himself aside...).

- Chloe perfumes have historically been a miss for me. For years, I couldn't even *smell* the OG ""Chloe"" EdP. The scent simply didn't register to my nose. So, I did my Trash Person thing and bought a bottle anyway. Only when I owned it (suspicious in itself... but moving on) could I smell something. And I loved it. A sharp, green, musky, kinda-soapy rose. Also, long-lasting and strong. What a win.
- The vast majority of Chloe flankers overwhelm me. Not their scent, simply their vastness. Enough already.
- ""Nomade"" is great, but just not *me*. I feel a bit like an imposter when I wear it despite my enjoyment of it. It smells awesome on a friend on mine, though.

This, though? Love at first sniff. As such, my favourite Chloe fragrance!

I adore the sharp, citrus, tangy opening notes! Neroli is also always a bomb scent, so that helps. I usually struggle with grapefruit, but it's epic here. Or just nicely blended.
The middle notes? Pure bliss. Orange blossom is fresh, sexy, and romantic. I have stephanotis in my garden and it's such an underrated flower. A strong jasmine that isn't...typical? I also get that juicy, fruity peach, and sexy black (under)currant.
When I die, send me home with a woody, floral musk! Fortunately, that's what I get here. A warm, cozy, intoxicating musk with cashmirwood/cashmeran. It would be a crime to not allow cashmeran to shine. It's woody, warm, slightly-vanillic, delightfully musky with hints of nostalgia (for me). Similar to Burberry ""Body"", the cashmeran invites hugs from your favourite person.

""Love Story"" resonates as a gorgeous, romantic, feminine, citrus floral that projects nicely (somewhat surprisingly) and lasts well - not forever, but enough to satisfy. I honestly think the perfume I've smelled that it most closely resembles is Jo Malone's ""Honeysuckle & Davana"". Do with that what you will.

I feel girly AND womanly. Like I can oscillate between the two all my days.

Repurchase-worthy!

Love Story Chloé,"Perfume in the same spirit as Joy (by Dior), the only difference is that Love Story is more dosed in white flowers, and the other one is more woody. Frankly, I prefer this perfume to Joy but it didn't captivate my heart as well.
The opening of the perfume is very nice, very fresh, we smell directly the citrus and white flowers. But it becomes a bit boring moments later and the evolution linear.
Despite the fact that it is very heavy in citrus and white flowers, I managed to distinguish the cashmere wood (which I love), and it is perhaps this note that distinguishes it from other floral, fresh and musky perfumes.

Nice scent but not extraordinary!

For me it’s true love with this one! I will continue to re-purchase. It’s an everyday scent. I’ve been wearing it through the entire winter now, and it works just as good as in summer. It’s a clean, fresh, feminine, non-intrusive, elegant scent. It’s sexy in a clean way.
Longevity is good on me, it lasts a whole workday.",01/11/23 09:52,Anabee
Love Story Chloé,"This fragrance is lovely when first sprayed ,but unfortunately an hour later and I’m struggling to smell anything. I’m so disappointed.",01/07/23 12:02,Mags322
Love Story Chloé,"Went from a neglected bottle in the back of my collection to everyday wear. An uncomplicated, pretty, and very subtle romantic floral that has been lifting my spirits in this Midwestern winter drear. A very complimentary blend of citrus and rose with a touch of pepper-ish cedar which sells this fragrance for me. The patchouli and black currant are hardly noticeable to my nose. Shockingly long-wearing on my skin, around seven hours. My partner's thoughts: ""I would like to be stuck on an elevator with someone wearing that.""",12/21/22 08:44,quelledame
Love Story Chloé,"I absolutely love this scent. I live in a tropical country & whenever i wear this scent, i feel so fresh ! The elements of rosé really shine through & its so good !
It lasts almost 7-8 hours on my skin & I absolutely love how it smells.
One of my favorite for sure !",12/19/22 03:16,ramanshweta
Love Story Chloé,"I'm rating from a travel size dabber. Very subtle and pretty scent. It's so gentle and freshly floral with a hint of clean citrus. The peach and pear add a nice sweetness as it dries down. The musk and woody base notes are definitely detectable but very light, on my skin the patchouli carries it, though that does work for this scent.

The little lock shaped bottle is so cute and fits the romantic scent very nicely, it would be an ideal scent for an afternoon date. It has a very intimate sillage, almost too intimate, I found myself wanting to top it off again right away. Longevity is not great at only 4-5 hours. It's a lovely scent while it lasts though.",12/05/22 15:17,d3athtul1ps

Love Story Chloé,"The review below from @Melis.t is exactly how I feel! Disappointing, synthetic, and more patchouli than I anticipated.",11/10/22 13:36,nickinicole
Love Story Chloé,"This perfume is BEAUTIFUL. It's clean, fresh, with a hint of sweetness to not smell as sharp as the original Chloe. This smells much more feminine and pretty than the OG. Original is more soapy, this one smells like a very expensive , feminine, Parisian classy perfume. If I smelled this on someone I would think they have their life together. This perfume is extremely classy and perfect for any occasion. It instantly puts me in a good mood, don't sleep on this!",11/02/22 17:59,happybyscent
Love Story Chloé,"I am really disappointed with this scent. Reading the comments I thought this could be my summer wedding fragrance but I found it very synthetic smelling. The opening is very sharp. I usually enjoy citrus opening in fragrances but I can't tolerate this one, it gives me instant headache. And way too powdery for my liking unfortunately.",10/20/22 11:23,Melis.t
Love Story Chloé,Very sweet orange blossom-y floral light airy (in a bad way that it doesn’t settle in). Doesn’t smell bad but nothing special.,10/07/22 09:57,Smelly_ponzu
Love Story Chloé,"Chloé Love Story is fresh and light with a beautiful woody dry down. Very feminine and ethereal, angelical almost. It also has a light oldschool vibe, but oldschool in a good way. Very classic smelling. The bottle design is perfect for its content. I somehow feel like, a ghost could wear this. I envision Marilyn Monroe with her natural hair color and a white linen dress, lounging under a tree and smiling. It’s a sunny day and she’s at peace with herself. One moment she’s there, then she’s gone again, but her scent lingers. The name ‘Love Story’ is fitting. Love yourself.",10/03/22 08:06,Anabee
Love Story Chloé,"This is beautiful white floral citrusy scent, perfect for spring and summer for the floral lovers out there, it lasts a couple of hours, I love this scent profile, it is addictive to me!",08/19/22 14:14,MimesOtto
Love Story Chloé,I was given thie perfume and lotion as a set. I'm not the biggest fan as I have had it for some years now and I haven't used it. I'm not moved by this fragrance as it is nothing exciting. It's mainly just floral with some fruity notes thrown in.,08/18/22 03:01,Marie20707
Love Story Chloé,"I think when this was being developed the mindset was “what is the perfect wedding scent?”
It is a beautiful, classic, feminine floral nothing outrageous or groundbreaking.
I can picture this being Grace Kelly’s wedding scent. Just so elegant. I think the orange blossom really shines here.
It is very faint and light. I would use 2 to 3 sprays with the regular Chloe but this is a 5 spray kinda scent and still very light.",08/04/22 19:43,dancingdear
Love Story Chloé,"This smells like something a teenager would wear. I blind bought this because I love the bottle design and I got a really cheap find. But it literally smells exactly like ever other above average priced perfume out today. They all blend into one. Maybe it’s me but it reminds me of Voce Viva which I also have (due to being a huge gaga fan). They’re just so generic. Is this what the generation of today wants?!? Give me no 5, Giorgio Beverly Hills, Ysatis, white musk and shalimar anyway. Jeez, I’d even prefer Charlie !",07/30/22 19:13,Mobrien37
Love Story Chloé,"On the tester paper, i loved this! On my skin, very much sweeter, white florals on first spritz. Smells very luxe and feminine, reminiscent of ferragamo type florals but more refined and luxurious. Longevity was about 2.5-3 hours for me, after which sits very close to skin, in a soapy floral manner - still luxe and feminine. Love this, wish it lasted longer. After 5-6 hours, it's gone - it's but a memory...",07/26/22 20:10,hazieee
Love Story Chloé,"as much as I love the Chloe by Chloe perfume, I love this Love Story more, it's more fruity and slightly sweeter compared to the Chloe and the longevity is quite strong on my skin",07/20/22 07:10,LindaL100
Love Story Chloé,"It’s a mature,elegant heavy white florals perfume. I don’t get much of the citrus notes,just white florals. The opening is a little heavy tbh, i like the dry down better.",07/19/22 23:21,bengii
Love Story Chloé,"The epitome of Parisian chic. Smells like an expensive French orange blossom soap. Beautifully clean and sophisticated. The opening can be a little soapy for some, but the dry-down is divine. I feel so feminine and elegant when I wear this fragrance.",07/17/22 03:03,Earthangel39
Love Story Chloé,"This is probably the safest blind buy I've ever smelled. It's a fresh white floral, nothing too special but I do love it. It also makes a great birthday gift!",06/26/22 13:16,yunoh
Love Story Chloé,The opening is beautiful! So feminine and a very good representation of a successful love story. The drydown seems similar to Bal d’Afrique but way better. Is it because they’re both citrus and soapy?,06/18/22 08:50,fishandbear
Love Story Chloé,"I went through a 1.2ml tester. Lovely fresh floral with some Chloe elegancy. However it misses all woody and powdery that is so present in other Chloe fragrances (I am a proud owner and a fan of Chloe edp and Naturelle). A bit generic, quite synthetic. Great for warm weather. However it is a bit sharp and headache inducing when over sprayed. The latter is a deal-breaker for me sadly.",06/17/22 12:35,lesritesdelavie
Love Story Chloé,"I love orange blossom and neroli, and I remember liking this when I first smelled it years ago, but now I found it too ""perfumey"" in the opening, but the drydown is better. I prefer the more natural Jo Malone Orange Blossom, the fresh qualities of TF Neroli Portofino, the exotic notes in JPG Classique amd PdM Safanad. It is pleasant enough, but not what I am looking for in my quest for the perfect orange blossom fragrance. I think I like the EDT more, even though I usually prefer EDPs.",05/24/22 11:34,QueenieIrenie
Love Story Chloé,"A lighter white floral with a bit of citrus. The lightness gives it a more modern flair than some of the big white floral classics. Smells good quality, but it also smells like a lot of other perfumes. An easy reach. Office safe. For orange blossom and neroli (both famously fleeting) it has good power and endurance. Base notes are in their softest imaginable forms.",05/18/22 10:08,coffeefifofum
Love Story Chloé,"retains some of the laundry fresh powdery thing the OG has but without the rose, a touch of fruit- like shampoo, but this is all class. Not cheap at all.

So nice for any occasion. Mellow, inoffensive, clean and a touch warm overall",05/14/22 02:01,dglightblue
Love Story Chloé,"Extremely feminine and romantic white floral scent, which is exactly what I like.I would like it to last a bit longer, though.",05/04/22 13:49,goblinbells
Love Story Chloé,"Perfect wedding day perfume. Beautiful traditional orange flower, notes of jasmine baby's breath (stephanotis is a jasmine), and a light muskiness to help make it a little sexy. Lots of grapefruit and lemon and a touch of bergamot up front to keep you fresh. Altogether a very pretty fragrance. Lots to like, nothing to dislike here. Sadly, no cashmirwood or patchouli detectable to my nose. This doesn't really need it, anyway. Although it might last longer if those notes were more pronounced. You'll probably need to top it off again after about five hours.",04/28/22 11:25,madamefelissa
Love Story Chloé,"I think it’s alright. The opening kind of gives me a headache, but the dry down is nice. It’s a simple citrusy scent with white florals imo, nothing special",04/23/22 08:17,d4hlia
Love Story Chloé,"To me this is just a clean scent, warmer and sweeter than the edt. Probably for the ""clean girl"" aesthetic, but not really unique or a huge compliment getter.",04/18/22 22:15,margielaenthusiast
Love Story Chloé,"This actually is my first white floral fragrance in my collection, and it is my favorite for this season of Spring going to Summer. It just smells so beautiful, its as if you are a carefree lady who just beams with grace, freedom, and happiness. The opening when I sprayed it on my skin were fresh, citrus notes, they tingled my sense of smell in the most non-annoying or non-painful way that other perfumes with citrus notes did. It smells clean, soapy, and fresh. The drydown after a few minutes where the white florals that smelled elegant, musky, beautiful. I love the musk here, it does seem to be a mature, and somewhat classic scent, but it is really beautiful, and it justifies its name Love Story. The age preference for this would be young adults to adults.",03/21/22 22:59,Ceszsy
Love Story Chloé,"My favorite of all Chloé fragrances. I decluttered it from my collection several months back because I no longer reached for it, but there was a time it was my most reached for perfume. Especially in the summer. It's really lovely and romantic. I miss it.",03/18/22 06:39,mermaidylady
Love Story Chloé,"I had a sample of this and I loved the initial smell. It really does smell like romance in a bottle! However, because of my warm body chemistry it smells heavy and musky on me. I ended up with the perfumed lotion (which is less intense) because there really is something about this scent that does remind me of a love story. The musk is still prominent in the lotion so at times I smell like a sexy grandma but if you don't mind musk or mature scents, this is a beautiful one to have :)",03/11/22 13:55,Effielove
Love Story Chloé,"I got a sentimental thing to this perfume because this is the very first perfume I bought for myself. I got it with my first salary from my internship in my collage years. It was the only perfume that I had for a long time. I'd wear it day and night, summer and winter. I finished 3 full 75 ml bottles of this. I got my 4th now. Right now it's definitely a summer perfume for me. It's citrusy, white floral and musky. I like the pear in this a lot. A very fresh scent. It lasts about 6-8 hours on me.",03/05/22 12:15,perfumewave
Love Story Chloé,"I love to layer and this is a delightful blend with versace yellow diamond intense. Both can worn on their own but just to make it ever so slightly personalized and longer lasting, I combine the two. You'll recognize the Chloe signature but without the litchi from the original which to me is headache inducing.",01/28/22 15:20,perfumelovere
Love Story Chloé,"Paris, may 2011. You just got asked out on a date! You carry a bouquet of flowers, and a cold, crisps breeze waves past you. Romantic, but in a really fresh way. Smells like real flowers, with the “bitter” notes. You can smell the bergamot clearly.",01/23/22 16:58,Elinorjohanse
Love Story Chloé,"It is an alright fragrance. That's all I can say about this, maybe it is the Chloe DNA that isn't up my alley, but I don't think it smells as great as the notes conjure it to be. It's not a bad scent, it is just very mediocre. If I smelled this on someone, I would say, yes they smell nice, but in a generic, synthetic floral-y kind of way. This is one of my few blind buys, but since it was on sale for $40 I thought it may be worth a shot, because I am a fiend for fresh citrus/bright floral scents. It's just not for me, especially when there are other better fragrances in my collection... it's a very ALRIGHT perfume.",01/10/22 06:59,eau_asam
Love Story Chloé,"I love it! I initially love Chloe but then I got to smell this and I realized I prefer this. It's light, floral and sweet. I'd wear this everyday. It's very feminine. Excited to buy the full bottle. The bottle is very lovely and elegant too.",01/08/22 05:46,pikathchu
Love Story Chloé,"This is a Love Story from the past, there is nothing modern about this perfume. It’s a classic floral and fruity scent that I imagine a young woman in the ‘50s would have worn. Perfectly coiffed, wearing big lucite flower clip earrings, a pastel color cardigan and one of those A shaped skirts, in a color coordinated flower pattern. I like the somehow soapy dry down of this perfume and the woody base notes but it’s too classic and floral for me.",12/30/21 11:01,kiaoi
Love Story Chloé,"I loved several other Chloe perfumes so I thought I would love this one.

The opening is very heavy citrus & floral, almost headache inducing for me. The dry down tones down on these notes a bit but they're still the dominant notes. I was really disappointed! I was thinking this would be a sweet and deliver floral to match the name ""Love Story"" but it feels like your typical citrus floral. I washed this one right off.",11/06/21 14:26,mangooo
Love Story Chloé,"The times I wore this perfume, I get comments that it smells like a men's perfume instead of a women's. It didn't last long on me and I didn't favour the smell. Although floral, it smells a little bit too musky for me.",11/05/21 04:08,ASAscents

Love Story Chloé,"Not my taste but I can see someone who can match with this perfume, girls who dress elegantly and in white and floral dresses, exactly like my cousin and this is one of her signatures. Someone who more on casual side like me wearing this is a big confuse.",10/18/21 09:32,khixitin
Love Story Chloé,Opening is incredibly stunning. Fresh jasmine with soft sweet fruity notes. But the dry down turned me off. It smells identical to loccitane’s neroli & orchidee,10/15/21 00:31,adelaidesandrina

Love Story Chloé,"i really love this perfume.. it smells feminine and not childish, i really smell the white floral. i dont really like pure floral scent but i like this perfume cuz it smells fresh kinda fruity floral, if you r feminine and prefer not that mature n old scent u might love this one.. it's suitable for day and night, formal and daily so this is worth the money",09/08/21 03:10,heyitscaa
Love Story Chloé,"Unfortunately it reminds me of a perfume I bought in college (Estee Lauder’s Sheer Beautiful), which I never ended up wearing. Something about this one is overly shrill, and the sweet florals are a little too much. On me. I wish it smelled the way I assumed it would after reading reviews, I just didn’t get that when I wore it. It’s not awful. I imagine it would be a good perfume for someone preppy-chic, out and about on a cool morning.",08/30/21 21:52,awkwardcat
Love Story Chloé,This is beautiful. You can definitely smell the Chloe dna. Very classy and sophisticated. A clean citrus with white florals which i think is great for the work environment. Very pretty scent.,08/30/21 13:17,Shan101beauty
Love Story Chloé,"Light, clean, fresh, & rosy. Smells like a lighter version of the original Chloe EDP to me. Wore it after a shower at night & could still smell it on my skin the next morning.",08/15/21 04:51,mellyv1973

Love Story Chloé,"Soft, light floral, clean. It feels like a safe choice. It's not attention grabbing - I had to remind myself to keep checking on it. It's a very mellow scent.

Love Story Chloé,"One word, Beautiful. The Love Story is one between you and this perfume. Love the pear that lingers on.",07/29/21 23:44,Ilprofumo
Love Story Chloé,"A very light & soft floral that’s safe for the office or even church. That being said, although pretty & fresh and very inoffensive, for me, it’s a little boring. However, it’s important I add that I currently own approximately 100 fragrances and tend to love the eternal longevity & strong silliage fragrances. Love Story is neither. This is great for a shy introvert that doesn’t want to draw attention to themselves. I’ve owned it a few weeks now and this evening is my second wear and I reached to it for a bedtime scent. I highly doubt I’ll repurchase this one, especially since it’s not worth the price tag, in my opinion. It’s OK.",07/22/21 19:28,Enchanted77
Love Story Chloé,"Despite the name I don't see this as a particularly romantic fragrance; it almost smells - for lack of a better word - virginal. It's a very clean and feminine white floral, best for daytime and smells very elegant and prim. There are similarities to the original Chloe but I feel like Love Story has less personality. It's fresher and just a hint sweeter. It smells EXACTLY like a dryer sheet for several hours after spraying, super detergent-y floral with hints of citrus. When it dries down more, the florals shine through the soapiness a little better and I get more of the fruity notes (mostly peach) which lends a hint of sweetness and creaminess. I couldn't figure out what this reminds me of until I read another review saying this smells like Caress Daily Silk - it totally does!! I like Love Story a lot but I'm not sure if it's worth buying because I already have the original Chloe.",07/14/21 18:59,clairesque
Love Story Chloé,"Love Story is such a pretty floral fragrance that screams Spring to me. Very feminine. Clean, floral, slightly sweet with a hint of fruit. Inoffensive. A great daytime, cool to warm weather scent in my opinion.",06/30/21 08:51,MWS3
Love Story Chloé,"I came to love this fragrance over time. At first it felt to elegant and mature for me. Now I really like it. Directly after applying, the pear is strong and a lot of fruity accords come through. On the drydown mostly the white florals and a delicious hint of the cedar come through for me.",05/28/21 02:07,Weltengängerin
Love Story Chloé,"My 2nd bottle from the Chloe perfume line. the first one I have was Chloe EDP which is soooooo amazing. so i decided to blind buy Chloe Love Story which i soooooo love tooo.

Chloe perfumes are not giving me headaches.",05/17/21 11:24,kingjoanna
Love Story Chloé,"I have Chloe Love Story EDP 50ML.

Instantly stunned by the beautiful design of the bottle itself. gold handle topped off with a white ribbon, you couldn't get any more feminine and classy than that.

I love most things that Chloe brings out. I feel its a well put together, classy brand. Owning the bags and glasses, I had to start a Chloe perfume collection going. I own other well reviewed perfumes such as Chanel No. 5 and J'adore Dior, so I was interested to see how a Chloe perfume would live up to standard.

I was pleasantly surprised. It is an extremely classy perfume. Has a slight hint of J'adore Dior resemblance, but different in it's own right. Firstly hit with a slow scent of white floral scents slowly merging into rose powdery blend. It is extremely floral. But for all the right reasons. It is light, bounces off the senses and hits classy in every sense of the word.

It could be worn as a daytime classy fragrance, maybe if you are attending something of importance-or if you just want to feel that extra bit of class, this is the perfume you would go for. It is not powerful and overbearing, just enough to give your senses some pleasure. The longevity is average, it doesn't dissipate quickly, you get a fair bit of time from it, however it does not last forever like some perfumes do. Overall I would reccomend purchasing this if you love a classy, floral scent.

Love Story Chloé,"Polite and pretty, Love Story is a good office perfume as long as it isn't over-sprayed. It's citrus, white flowers, and warm dryer sheet musk -- very similar to Chloe EDP but more approachable and less hoity-toity Aunt at the family reunion. Sorry, but my fancy seventy year old Auntie loves Chloe. It doesn't get more old-lady approved than that.

Love Story is a less soapy and more subdued alternative to Chloe. The synthetic white musk is way toned down, but still present, and much more wearable. If you can't smell the particular molecule(s) being used as the ""white musk"" additive, and I know a few people who can't, this perfume may smell very bland...like a bit of citrus and neroli. But trust me, you smell (nice). Haha!",04/14/21 17:39,starsnek

Love Story Chloé,I know J’adore very well and this smells just like that to me.. very unoriginal.,03/18/21 16:43,sejohnson77
Love Story Chloé,"This is probably one of the most GENERIC and BORING perfumes I’ve ever owned. If you already have any floral, mildy sweet and clean perfume you don’t need this one. Trust me.
It smells okay, it’s just a dime a dozen. Also, it doesn’t have that much longevity or sillage so there’s no reason to have this in your collection of you have fragrances with similar notes.",02/26/21 10:41,Koningin
Love Story Chloé,"This was a blind buy for me, I needed a replacement for my go-to day perfume (For Her by Karl Lagerfeld) and I thought this one could be a bit similar in a nice fresh floral way. And it was! A perfect feminine everyday scent, very easy to wear. However-- the longevity is quite weak on the skin. I can't smell it on me at all, which is super disappointing. Although it does stay on your clothes for a really long time. I think that it might be one of those perfumes where others can feel the scent but you can't. Would def recommend it if you want a casual floral scent or just want to wear a nice scent at home.

It works really well in combination with other perfumes! I used this one mixed with a vanilla scent the other day (loved it!) and it would probably also be nice mixed with a clean fresh scent to really bring out the crisp citrus if you want.",02/24/21 15:25,aemw
Love Story Chloé,"Too me it's name is true for over time I fell in love with this perfume. It is a soft delicate scent which is quite lovely, appealing to men, my husband loves the scent on my skin. From the opening of soft grapefruit light lemon with pear it's is very pretty, pleasing to the senses, I enjoyed as it developed to the orange and rose, the scents I noticed the most, then to a powdery light musk, with a touch of floral , I was very pleased. It has a 6 hour longevity and if you use the body lotion it will last until the next morning. It has a moderate sillage which I really liked alot. for times you want to be noticed but not make a bold statement.",02/24/21 00:06,carlahoffman
Love Story Chloé,"I tried this because the original Chloe is one of my all-time favorite scents. I also like Chloe Le Fleur and Roses de Chloe. I'm not crazy about Nomade. So-- my first thought on this one was, ""wow, that's a lot of jasmine."" I love citrus and white floral and roses, so this should be perfect for me. However, I'm not getting much other than the jasmine and orange blossom. It turns a little powdery on the dry down. It's definitely classy and mature, although it doesn't lean ""grandma"" in my opinion. That said, for me it's just an okay fragrance, which is a surprise, because I expected to be in love with it based on the notes. It's smooth and not cloying or cheap smelling, but it's a little to straight classic on me with not much else going on, so I find it a bit boring. I miss the citrus and rose from the original Chloe that make the floral so watery and fresh smelling in that one. This is more heavy white floral and powder, so I won't be buying this one. I got an 8 ml decant of this, so it has given me several chances to try it, and although I'll use it up, I'm not in love.",02/06/21 12:49,TaraRachelle
Love Story Chloé,"Not a fan personally - I got an overpowering rose note immediately to the point I had to scrub it off. This is a sophisticated and mature fragrance, but I don't think it veers into the dreaded Grandma category so many fragrance reviewers label perfumes they hate with. For me, this is not a win because I am not really a huge classic floral, but especially not a huge rose, fan, but if you love a strong rose perfume, this might be a major love for you.",11/18/20 15:00,justlikemagic
Love Story Chloé,"Clean, casual, well put together white floral scent. It starts off quite energetic with the citrus and neroli mix. Calms down to a pleasant and easygoing floral scent that lasts a good 6+ hours on me. On the dry down, it smells quite soapy on me, I'm surprised I don't see lily-of-the-valley listed as a note.

I can see a respectable young lady wearing this effortlessly during the day.

Personally, I've gone through 2+ bottles of this during my university days.",11/04/20 20:28,alixiialice
Love Story Chloé,"Of the modern Chloe fragrances I have tried, this is the one I like the least. It isn't bad, it just is not nearly as good as any of the others. Love Story is pretty in a slightly generic kind of way, and it does not last very well at all. I had to double check to see if the decant I had was EDT, because I rarely experience such bad longevity from EDP. Chloe fragrances tend to be slightly aloof, but Love Story is so aloof that it just flutters away before you can really fully enjoy it. This would be a fabulous scent in a candle or a body wash where you expect it to be slightly fleeting, but as a perfume, for me, it is not special enough to warrant more than just a decant.",09/02/20 10:02,pleasuretoburn
Love Story Chloé,"Love Story by Chloé is a decent white floral scent. Moderate sillage, longevity not very good. It smells pretty, but too much like a bunch of other things I already have. I’m starting to understand what the frag snobs mean when they say all of these soft white florals start to run together after a while. There’s nothing particularly unique or remarkable about this one. It’s good, but not great. I would buy it if there weren’t other things in my collection that already smell this way. A safe choice if you’re just looking for an everyday, wear-to-work scent.",09/02/20 08:38,SeauxGood

Love Story Chloé,"Smells similar to the original Chloe, except this one is less sharp, more 'round', dusty, soft, a little less elegant but still elegant.
the person I picture wearing this is the super feminine but low-key classy young lady who stays to herself for the most part. she gets attention because she has a friendly and gentle vibe to her.

it smells pleasant and clean.. but a little uninteresting in my opinion. a good every day scent for the office.

this is nice go-to to have in your collection.
it's definitely not one i would wear on a night out or a date or for brunch mimosas even.

another reviewer said this smells like a pastors daughter... there ya go!",08/01/20 16:13,ohmichelle
Love Story Chloé,"It’s an okay perfume. I wouldn’t remember it as it really blends in with all the rest and I cannot find any element which would stand out (for me at least). It’s nice floral scent tho, and as I’ve got it on a big sale I didn’t mind paying for it but put it this way: I wouldn’t spend the full price on this perfume. However if we get over the price value part, it’s and elegant, light scent, not so powerful but can be felt on the skin quite clearly, wouldn’t be a scent anybody could feel unless they are close close close to you. Nice for spring but can imagine for a perfume all year around due to its softness.",07/17/20 09:16,Naomie
Love Story Chloé,"As Love Story dries down and the neroli fades, you get the powdery Chloe DNA. I imagine a corsage tucked in a love letter, pressed between the pages of a favorite book. Love Chloe, also powdery dry, is a little more interesting “read.”",07/14/20 18:43,—}—@ darlingbud
Love Story Chloé,"This to me smells like a wealthy (and classy!) woman's perfume that she wears for running errands. I imagine Love Story on someone wearing sunglasses, white linen trousers, a blazer and a handbag that costs more than my monthly salary.

I am not the biggest fan of Chloe perfumes (used to love the one called Love but that's now discontinued), bought a 10 ml rollerball version of this on clearance.

Quite different from most of the perfumes I own, but I do really like it.

Edit: longevity and sillage are no good. If they were better, I would have purchased the full size perfume.",07/08/20 05:01,kkaattjjeess
Love Story Chloé,When I first sprayed this I could sense that this one is very very similar to Issey-Miyake pure. Exactly the same for me. Sadly I have bought 75ml and I have Issey-Miyake as well😂 that one stays for long this one does not. Anyway but I like the smell. Very white floraly and fresh.,06/06/20 03:53,Harshitasingh

Love Story Chloé,"I got this perfume by mistake, i ordered the original love, chloe which is now discontinued and received this instead. Then, i planned on wearing it as my office perfume as i could not return. I tested it out for a couple of days and all i can keep smelling is heavy sweet citrus citrus citrus which i did not like at all ( My taste leans more towards powdery, clean, fresh, woody scents). I did not smell any of the floral/rose/clean/jasmine notes mentioned above nothing. Not one time and i went through an entire bottle. IRONICALLY everyone and literally everyone at work complemented me everyday on this perfume and asked what i was wearing. A guy once said please stop wearing it or else ill follow u all day long. I went through a whole 75ml bottle just because how much people liked it on me yet i did NOT. do i reccomend this ? Mayeb. Will i buy it again? Nope 😂😂 i just dont know how this perfume projected on me in a way people loved it but my nostrils hated.",10/27/19 13:25,Nourh

Love Story Chloé,"A beautiful scent that can stand on its own even if it is compared to other perfumes. It’s actually an underdog because it’s floral, fresh and nice for the summer. A good perfume for women in their 20’s.",09/11/19 00:34,natasha calli
Love Story Chloé,"White floral, yes, but I do catch the rose quite clearly. Citrus as well. I don't find it as sweet as some have mentioned despite the many fruit notes. It certainly is not sweet compared to some of the gourmands and sugary-sweet perfumes out on the market. After several hours wearing it, it doesn't really develop or evolve into anything different. It is what it is when you spray it on and I still smell it clearly the next morning. The bottle is very nice. I like the padlock design as a nod to the bridge in France where people put the locks.",09/10/19 09:30,mevans
Love Story Chloé,"My review will certainly not add anything new here, because there is not much to say about this composition. Romantic? For me, romanticism does not smell trivial, and this is how it is and if I did not know that it is a respected Chloe brand, I would bet on Avon, which already says everything in itself. This fragrance is simply weak and not worth the price. Everything here is so pretty, subtle, charming, girlish, but at the same time yawning boring and forgettable. There is the freshness of white flowers with the lightness of cedar and musk, but that in my opinion does not smell love. None. Well, possibly such a youthful infatuation, not very serious, which passes very quickly, just like the whole smell. My biggest complaint is that nothing is happening here, nothing attracts attention, because there is no time, the parameters are poor. Scent, which was created for unknown reason.",08/26/19 07:33,perfumeholic88
Love Story Chloé,"Clean, fresh, nothing offensive. Something you can wear when you want to offend nobody with your perverse tastes :D I get no neroli (thankfully) nor the soapy feel (also good in my books) just lots of white florals and touch of fresh juicy fruits (none of which are really discernible) This would make a great gift for someone feminine and conservative about their daily wear.",08/12/19 11:00,Cherry_Darling
Love Story Chloé,I enjoyed my samples of Love Story. Its so clean and fresh and soapy to me. Ive read comparisons to laundry detergent and I agree. Its inoffensive. Sometimes I steer away from wearing because it is very sweet and girly. I pick up neroli pear and musk. I reached for this most at the end of the day after showering and putting on pajamas.,08/12/19 10:42,ridgel
Love Story Chloé,"I could not for the life of me figure out what this perfume reminded me of. I finally figured it out. It’s Caress Daily Daily Silk, fancied up. That must mean to my nose this perfume is predominantly orange blossom and peach. The drydown is a sweet, clean musky orange blossom. I’m somewhere in the middle on this perfume - I adore the drydown, and am somewhat less enthusiastic about the top notes. I highly recommend for women who love soapy clean scents with an intimate level of silage. This is not a powerhouse, but does have its own gentle tenacity that hugs the skin for the majority of the day. The name and beautiful bottle convinced me to take this perfume home, so we will see if she has a permanent place in my collection.",07/03/19 18:56,kaejuntun
Love Story Chloé,"Very sweet and very flowery, perfect for daily use, for school, office, etc. It's not like super long lasting, but it definitely lasts longer than the usual perfumes. I loved it from the second I smelled a sample",05/16/19 01:03,Esi42
Love Story Chloé,"This is a very dainty, ladylike, demure scent. Not the most distinctive or the craziest, but there is nothing wrong with that. This isn't meant for tweens or a younger demographic either, the way Marc Jacobs Daisy + all of its flankers are (no disrespect meant, either, because I get the appeal of sweet, fresh scents that don't pose too much of a mature, grown up aura for the wearer to have to live up to).

It's not as sharp or cloying as the original revamped Chloe (while it is pretty and very clean and soapy smelling, the strong carnation overwhelms the scent at one point, and seems to take over and invade my nostrils). Admittedly, I really like white florals, but I am aware that this is not the most popular sentiment. A lot of complaints I seem to hear about a lot of perfumes is about the headiness of the white florals, or how cloying or heavy they are. I always loved white florals because of how romantic and sweet they smell, while evoking the scent of summer.

This is a very clean, soapy, floral, inoffensive scent. When it is sharp when first sprayed, it is not too sharp, but just crisp. During the drydown, it becomes softer. This would make a lovely bridal scent--very sweet, romantic, and gentle but not overbearing or overwhelming at all.

It might be worth noting that I don't have a very sophisticated nose. I try to keep an open mind and my poorly concealed guilty pleasure is cheap celebrity scents. But this is nothing to turn your nose up at (no pun intended). Clean, pretty, not too showy or ostentatious, while having a bit of soapy sophistication that others may consider bland fodder for department store counters. To each their own, I suppose. I understand why others would see this as boring, but I see it more as being ""classic"". This is something you could wear when you want to be taken seriously--first thing I thought of was that this was something the wife of a well to do businessman would wear to a work function. It's not controversial and doesn't cause tongues and fingers to wag disapprovingly--of course, if that's what you want in a perfume, you probably already know that Chloe Love Story isn't for you. I think it's perfect for the workplace if you spray very sparingly (on me personally, Chloe scents tend to get very strong, so I just go with one spritz).",03/20/19 14:17,SeaAnais

Love Story Chloé,Starts off smelling very similar to Chloe EDP with the loud sparkling white florals and then turns sugary with the exact same sharp sugary sweetness that's in Armani Acqua Di Gioia.

The florals continue and have an almost realistic quality to them like the lily in Cartier Bassier vole.,11/06/18 15:45,Mrs.Allard

Love Story Chloé,"I just bought a 50ml bottle, and I'm in love! I do agree that it's kind of generic, but it still has that Chloé DNA. It's slightly more soapy than the other Chloés, though. It has a ton of white flowers and kind of has an expensive lotion scent (maybe because of the peach note). The sillage is so soft; it's very intimate—only people close to you will smell it. The longevity is good; it lasts 5-6 hours and even lingers after I've washed my hands or taken a shower. I can't wait to give it a proper wear!",08/26/18 14:08,BihterAnneBoleyn
Love Story Chloé,"I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF CHLOE LOVE STORY!!!!! It smells so good. I know that I sometimes over spray because, I want to smell myself - always. Sillage and longevity are very good. My assistant once told me that, even when I'm minutes gone from the office, she can still feel my presence, because my scent lingers in the room.

The scent is ladylike, sweet, and I love the flowers in it. This is love at first smell. It's a little bit expensive, but so worth it.",07/10/18 21:07,marianne76
Love Story Chloé,"Probably my favorite spring/summer perfume for everyday wear. I reviewed this over a year ago rather unfavorably, but have since changed my mind and ended up purchasing a bottle about a month ago. I have quite a few fragrances in my collection that I designate for this time of year - Chloe EDP, Gucci Bamboo, Marc Jacobs Daisy, Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet, and more. Love Story is the one I find myself reaching for most. Simply put, it is a very pretty, very feminine floral fragrance.

The initial citrusy blast didn't make a large impression on me, but you really have to *wear* this perfume to get the whole gorgeous picture. Once the sharpness of the initial spray passes, you get a beautiful, fresh floral bouquet sweetened subtly with fruity notes. The drydown is my favorite part - a warm, comforting, and sexy mix of woods and musk.

I do wish it had the performance of Chloe EDP. I wouldn't say it's weak in sillage or longevity, but I think it could be better. I usually have to reapply once or twice during the day, unlike Chloe EDP which goes strong for 12+ hours.",07/05/18 11:10,mermaidylady
Love Story Chloé,"Many retail websites that sell this (Macy's, French Sephora, etc.) are reporting that this perfume has a physalis/cape gooseberry note. I tracked down the original Fragrantica article for this from 2014 and the notes list is significantly shorter. On the Chloe website the notes are:

""A fresh floral fragrance
Top: neroli
Heart: orange blossom, stephanotis jasmine
Base: cedar wood""

(Stephanotis being a type of jasmine)

Anyway has anyone noticed the physalis/cape gooseberry note? I just bought it but I'm covered in all sorts of other perfume fro the store so I'm not really going to be able to truly sit down and test it until tomorrow... (at which point I'll probably delete this and write a proper review...)",05/30/18 07:58,bibibling
Love Story Chloé,"I'm very surprised to read descriptions here to the effect that this is a 'fierce' white floral, or that it contains 'overwhelming' musk. To me it is a gentle unobtrusive fragrance having an effect on the surrounding persons at most a sweetening ambience. I think I am just not acutely sensitive to any of it's constituents; but I'll leave a discussion of the nature of that sensitivity to the forum, or I run the risk of repeating myself. No-one I have come across has complained about it, but I think even if any of them are sensitive to the ingredients I don't think they are likely to perceive it as at all actually shocking or any such thing. And I've been enjoying it all day for what I perceive it to be: a sharpish (yes I do get the orange-blossomy-ness of it) floral, not at all sweet, except insofar as it is sweetened and enriched by the musk, which I do indeed perceive as an 'enricher', but by no means as an overwhelming aroma in its own right. I could even say it comes across as a little aqueous at times. And woodiness - yes, some of that there ... everything moderate and balanced, to my perception anyway.",05/29/18 13:29,YYY_Delilah
Love Story Chloé,"Love Story is a green, woody, musky, white floral. It is a delight. I was captivated at first whiff. It reminds me of a fireflies at dusk, walled gardens with ivy, and the heady, humid days between spring and summer. It has a bit of grassy green to balance out the white floral. Projection is strong, too. It is a staple in my wardobe and I hope it never gets discontinued.",05/18/18 18:15,colorfulmess
Love Story Chloé,"A beautiful orange blossom fragrance...wow! I really adore Chloe perfumes.. from the heady older Lagerfeld ones to the new fresh florals. I just could not believe it when I tried this.. utterly gorgeous. My new favorite orange blossom for sure, pushing aside Armani Code. The ginger ended up ruining that one for me.

This is luscious orange blossom haze blooming on a warm summer afternoon. For me that's always been a romantic and sensual scent, so I find this fragrance aptly named. And what is more beautiful than a love story? Even the bottle is gorgeous in its simplicity with the little handle and ribbon on top!

My new go-to sunny summer day scent.. what a fabulous blind buy!!",05/13/18 01:18,greyhoundmom
Love Story Chloé,"I am not a fan of floral bouquet perfumes, preferring those that focus on one or two floral notes. I am also not a fan of most anything soapy. I must admit that I didn't have high expectations for this, but I am searching for a perfect summer neroli/orange blossom and had to give it a try.

This is much better than I expected. The orange blossom is clear and stands out from the Rose and jasmine. The fruit noes are subtle and with the cedar and musk give depth and keep the scent from becoming prissy. There are some clean soapy notes as it settles, but noting that overtakes it and makes it unpleasant.

Love Story Chloé,"I have this, and was going to offload it but then thought twice about it.

Neroli and Orange Blossom are two notes that immediately evoke SUMMER to me, even if they aren't trying, and there's no reason that shouldn't be the case here. Upon further wearing, this brings to mind gentle linen laundry hanging on a line to dry in the French country side. It makes me think of that pink clay and the California-like natural scenery.

Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"I had this YEARS ago (2015 and I THINK it was discontinued way back THEN! ) Shortly after -- I got rid of it because I recall it being ""too perfume-y"". Over a period of time I realized that , I now LOVE ""too perfume-y"" ! So I lamented over this and even ROMANTICIZED it (possibly a bit too much now).
I spotted an unused TESTER on ebay for a very reasonable price (more reasonably than people who are selling the discontinued Chloe Narcisse ! That's for SURE!) . I just opened this up from the mail a half hour ago. The one thing I totally forgot was how SWEET & SOAPY this was. Not a bad thing , I had just remembered this wrongly. Once this dries down - things get MUCH better and the neroli part , although NOT the star of the show - trickles enough to remember why I bought this. I am happy with my re-purchase and she shall never leave me again. This is a nice composition by a very stable house. And you do get the vibe that this is ""cousin"" to Chloe Narcisse as well . Safe blind buy BUT only if you like smelling the big jumbo Neroli soap bars from Marshalls & T.J. Maxx (and I mean that in a GOOD way for a change). Longevity is very good / above average and this perfume has a nice ""body"": to it. All plusses. It's discontinued - but you can still get a fair deal on it .

Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"It's gonna be summer soon, and I was craving my summery scents. Reached for Chloe Eau de Fleurs Neroli yesterday and could not stop sniffing myself with glee for this beautiful eau.

Neroli always reminds me of the old 80s Coppertone, which has really positive memories for me, playing on the beach in the summer. My other favorite neroli scents are simplistic ones; the Jo Malone Neroli, and 4711 Original Eau de Cologne. I don't like to layer it with anything; I take my neroli ""neat,"" like my whiskey.

I get some of the other notes in this scent. Orange, yes. Maybe a little Tonka and Amber, but the Peony is very subtle if I do smell it. And the others, I'll take their word for it, but they lost in the mix as far as my nose can tell. Regardless, it's just lovely to me, and I adore it! It's a feminine scent to me, so I think the other notes in this blend are definitely doing their work to support that femme vibe. I have definitely experienced neroli on the masculine side, like the TF version, and even 4711 I mentioned above, leans masculine to me. But Chloe's is definitely feminine.

All that said, while it's a sweet and beautiful scent, it's not outlaw sexy, but it definitely CAN be sexy, if the wearer feels and acts sexy. For example, I feel happy and pretty when I put this on, and that positivity/confidence lends itself to sexy. But do I feel turned on by it, and ready to pounce on man meat like I do when I wear my TF Tobacco Vanille or F-Fab? No. If I wear my Chloe Neroli and have a drink, or put on sexy clothes and lipgloss, will I feel just as sexy as the TF scents? Hell yes. So it's what you do with it.

If you're looking for a classic pretty scent, this works on that level too. And it is long lasting in my experience, which is a great bonus!

Enjoy!",05/27/21 20:16,Lomama
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"What a wonderful discovery this Eau de Fleurs Neroli da Chloé, my Father in heaven! I was able to have a dejavú added as soon as it touched my skin, because I associated it in an identical way to two fragrances that I used a lot in my childhood and I have no problem, related to shame, in revealing them, they are: Mithus Colony Morning and Colony Contouré. Daydream, chimera, love!

A scene came to mind right at the opening ... A 7-year-old girl, sitting on a swing on a spring morning, with a fabric ribbon tied in her hair, cradling herself near a garden that drinks from a stream that it runs smoothly. In other words, Neroli's innocent and clean touch is capable of causing feelings that we don't even know how to deal with.

I felt Rosemary in the dry down, along with Neroli and the power of Peony, which beside Camellia, are my flowers of life. The scent of a clean woman, of a secret place, of peace, zero problems and a perennial paradise is transmitted in the middle of this perfume. There are times when using it we find ourselves silly standing in time idealizing infinite things related to the practice of good! LOL

In the base notes it has musk of light and a subtle resinous touch, with more the presence of Neroli in stalk, leaves and core, and none other than Peony in lush petals, sublime this aroma! I am surprised because even the fragrance after drying is somewhat intimate, in me Eau de Fleurs Neroli fixed for more than 10 h, bravely resisting an intense bath with Phebo soaps!",05/20/21 06:45,Jernê Knowles
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"I adore neroli, it’s definitely one of my favourite notes. I love the smell of an orange orchard after a rainfall when the air feels HEAVY with the haunting notes of mock orange blossom. Since falling in love with Narcisse Noir about 35 years ago, I haven’t found anything that comes close to that intense abundance of a field with flowering murraya.

Oh...this sounds like a segue into a confirmation that Chloe’s Eau de Fleurs Neroli is the long lost holy grail. No it isn’t, but it’s still a very acceptable Neroli, especially when it dries down a tad, and it lingers pretty well. It’s a sweet mock orange happening here, fresh and vibrant, makes you feel zesty enough to take on the day.",04/03/18 15:23,Annabear
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,Bought this blind because I love neroli and generally enjoy Chloe fragrances. Very fresh but slightly sharp citrus blast at first.

Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"what i like is all the green and herbs in this perfum. This is aromatic, simple, bitter sweet and have a feel of unisex without being too masculine or feminine. very stylish. Perfect for hotter days wearing well cut smart casual with some shiny modern jewellery.

The down side is longevity. It reduces to some bitter skin scent after around 2 hours. Also the box (of 100 ml) is very big! i thought i have brought a 200ml! the cup is very heavy too! i took off the cup and put the glass bottle in my handbag for re-appllication. The glass bottle is light.",08/09/15 20:31,AnnaT
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"A clean, light and fresh fragrance that transports you to dewy, sun rayed orange orchards. It uplifts spirits. It's a shame this wonderful scent has poor sillage and close to no longevity on me. Applying literally 12 sprays, after an hour, I couldn't smell it anymore unless I pressed my nose to my wrists and inhaled very deeply. I do recommend this scent for a casual spring day, but also recommend you take the bottle with you for touch ups ;)",05/04/15 08:33,Sandra Smells Scents-uous
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,Sorry but it's nothing like Prada Infusion de Fleur d'Orange. Prada's is very much tuberouse oriented and much nicer for women as I have both and Prada's just a piece in the collection. Chloe Neroli is pretty much a unissex scent. And very clean.,07/30/14 11:57,Jose Marcos
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"Neroli neroli how much I love you!!!I used to like pure orange scents,I thought that neroli was too bitter for my taste...until I smelled Chloe Eau de Fleurs Neroli!This is heaven,sun,joy,freedom,light in a bottle!Mostly orange and neroli on my skin,not sweet nor bitter,just right!It's clean,solar,sunny,flirty,such a happy perfume!The essence of clothes drying in the sun!",06/09/12 13:24,Majesty
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"I just got it today, and first blast was a bit of unpleasant surprise (i thought what a cheap stinker, and i even thought that it is male's aftershave smell), BUT have a patience with this perfume, after a bit there is beautiful main accord, which is Really Does differ this perfume from cheap smelling stuff, it has a bit of oldfashioned feeling to it but in the very good sense, and it is also modern (if it does make sense). And yes, i agree that it is summery perfume, which i wanted for summer, because for winter i really love warm ""in your face perfumes"". I do enjoy the smell (which is subtle and natural), but i am not sure that people around me can still smell it, i used few generous helpings of perfme, but you have to reapply it. Also, it gives happy feeling ( already being mentioned in reviws) which is very true.",06/08/12 14:59,beesha
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"I really love this one! At some point it strongly reminds me of Prada's Infusion de Fleur D'Oranger, but it is less soapy. As I changed my taste in scents recently, I really love floral scents and Neroli is just a perfect mix of flowers and freshness. I hope my fiancee likes it as much as I do.",05/24/12 23:40,cherie97
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"I am crazy about this lovely fragrance since the last summertime. It is a fresh, refreshing I would say, composition of notes and somehow this perfume leads me into a positive mood! I've bought Fleurs de Neroli some days ago and I would absolutely repurchase it.",03/09/12 14:57,w_nmbo
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"This is a very natural smelling Neroli-scent with a gentle freshness in the opening and a warm, slightly musky sweet drydown. I find this Edt very beautiful and true to nature. The Neroli-scent is very refined and can be worn at any age and at most occasions. The fragrance is elegant and quiet, warm and comforting. The longevity on my skin is excellent (+ 15 hours). The bottle and box are very beautiful, classy and luxurious. To me: a true beauty in any meaning of the word.",07/23/11 05:42,kwarnst
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"Bought three sample vials from Ebay containing all three of the Chloe Eau de Fleurs range. Neroli was the one I disliked when I first smelled it. It was too strong and reminded me of detergent. However, the drydown is beautiful and reminds me a lot of CK One. It really does smell like that on my skin!",07/12/11 07:00,CottonSpore80
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"If you like orange and neroli, this might be a good pick. It dries down to a musky neroli and I didn't find it very interesting all in all. I liked Capucine most of the range, but then again not enough to buy it. The price is quite expensive and you can get one-dimensional-floral-scents for much less.",06/13/11 02:48,Habanita
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"You know, I almost contemplated tossing my flacon of Prada Infusion D'Homme after wearing Eau de Fleurs Neroli for the 1st time. This has to be one of the most natural neroli perfumes on the market. Longevity is surprising for an EDT and the sillage is wonderful. This is a head-turner on my skin and fabric. It's clean, somewhat unisex and very natural-smelling. The neroli and peony shine with my skin chemistry. I never would have thought that Chloe perfumes would suit my skin until I tried the Eau de Fleurs series. The Neroli is definitely a keeper!",05/01/11 11:01,jae
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"Neroli is not usually a note that I enjoy. Most of the time it presents itself as being too green or too bitter, which turns me off most fragrances with neroli as its dominant note. This fragrance however, is far more pleasant than any other neroli based scent I've tried so far.

It's a rather delicate and subtle, orangey-soap smell with a touch of sugary sweetness. It's not breathtakingly unique, however it's very appealing, at least in my opinion.

It opens with bright, Spring-like citruses that at first reminded me of cleaning products. Thankfully that clean, antiseptic scent disappeared leaving a pleasant sweet and soapy orange note with an underlying spiciness caused by the sage and rosemary.

Unfortunately I think I'd tire of this fragrance rather quickly due to its lack of lasting strength and linear composition after the heart. It loses a lot of its character after a while, but if subtle soap scents are what you crave, certainly go ahead and test this entire range.

Although Eau de Fleurs Neroli left me uninspired and wanting more depth, it certainly reigns supreme as being a classy and elegant fragrance. Many fragrance releases over the last few years lack these qualities, so I'm truly glad to have found at least one fragrance that has managed to achieve this successfully.",05/01/11 04:57,missk
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"Very quiet and elegant scent.

Splendid in spring and the summer. Many a time we need the scent which does not crush , gives a lot of cleannes.
I thought that Capucine is the best ,but how I recognized ,smell Neroli and surely she will be the queen of the my summer:)

Buttle are beautiful.",03/14/11 04:28,TakaBeata
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"Opened with a pleasant blast of lemon, then softened into orange, very fresh, very natural at the opening. Then, as other reviewers have mentioned, it settled down with the other floral, herbal, musk and amber notes, and that's where it remained, with a slight undertone of citrus.

One thing about the citrus: it's such a shame that the cleaning product industry has appropriated some very authentic and lovely citrus scents, because now anything that's truly citrus reminds me of the product I use to clean my wood floors.

Should a true parfumista be able to rise above that association? You know, how they say a true fan of classical music should be able to listen to Wagner's Ride of Valkyries and not think of Bugs Bunny?

Even though I can't stop sniffing my wrist, I'm not sure this scent is ME. Maybe by the time the sample is done I'll have figured it out.",02/01/11 10:42,candymarie
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"This fragrance opens with a bang; a lush orange accord with a bit of sweetness. Unfortunately, as with Fleurs de Capucine, within about 15 minutes I was left with nothing but a fairly characterless sweetness.",06/29/10 18:59,melancholybaby
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,"I love neroli, and am so glad I found this. It is heaven!

But I never would have guessed that it includes rosemary, sage, amber, tonka bean or musk! To me, it is citrusy, green and floral.

Although I'd say it's a delicate floral (similar to orange blossom, kind of), the sillage is impressive. So is the lasting power.

I knew I had to have it on first sniff. It brought me up to some high, euphoric place, where I felt like I was floating in air, the ether, and sunlight was all around...",05/18/10 08:31,Taliera
Eau de Fleurs Neroli Chloé,it started with lovely neroli-florals accord... but then it get me dissappointed... it went flat and so unimpressive powder-musk mix...,04/09/10 07:10,teedee
Neroli Chloé,"I'm shocked by the amount of negative reviews of this perfume, saying it only lasts 30 minutes and is a very basic perfume. Yes, the notes are very simple but it is extremely elegant. I have tried multiple neroli fragrances and nothing compares to how beautiful this fragrance smells. It does sit closer to the skin, but I am not a fan of fragrances that command a room. Also, it easily lasts 3-4 hours on my skin. It's also extremely affordable for a high-end fragrance.",08/13/25 00:15,saffcol
Neroli Chloé,This smells like a laundry detergent OMG,07/18/25 09:31,koszenia
Neroli Chloé,"This fragrance offers a smooth and balanced composition that feels both modern and timeless. It opens with a fresh, inviting burst that captures attention right away. The heart reveals a gentle blend of floral, woody, or spicy notes, depending on the profile, creating depth and elegance. The base is warm and long-lasting, leaving a subtle yet memorable trail. Ideal for daily wear or special occasions, it’s a versatile scent that suits many moods and styles.",07/15/25 08:00,CurtisGareau
Neroli Chloé,"On its own, this perfume is very weak (lasts maybe 30-40 minutes), and boring. It’s probably better for layering with other scents, but than it’s quite expensive for something not be worn on its own.
Agree with others who say it’s very underwhelming.",11/10/24 17:24,eva.daisy.88
Neroli Chloé,Neroli and laundry detergent. Lasts for 30 minutes. I layer this with Cedrus or Lavanda but scent isnt unique at all. Waste of money.,04/25/24 07:49,jdluvz
Neroli Chloé,"This can be hit-or-miss. I adore it, but almost everyone else I’ve met hates it. It’s very feminine, fresh and floral. The orange blossom is my favourite. The only downside is it doesn’t last long at all. 1 hour at best. Such a shame because it’s so lovely.",08/25/22 12:16,Neetzxo
Neroli Chloé,"Slightly bummed. Definitely strong smelling, you can smell the neroli but the smell of detergent is slightly off putting. Smells like an expensive laundry detergent spray. I only use a tiny bit of it as a layering perfume, because I don’t love it on it’s own.",08/25/22 10:48,Sydneychild
Neroli Chloé,"Huge disappointment :( The bottle is so beautiful and elegant, I was hoping it would hold the elixir of dreams. Sadly, the fragrance is...underwhelming. It's a simple white floral, quite insipid. There are no citruses to break the white floral, also - no honey (which was mentioned in the description). I'm getting honeysuckle more than anything. It's very flat, keeping close to the skin. Definitely inoffensive, simple and clean. Disappears after 4 hours.",08/19/21 23:47,DiscoPolga
Neroli Chloé,"This is a lovely, fresh, bright, beautiful neroli/orange blossom scent with a hint of the Chloe soapy undertone that I love (you can pick this out in Chloe L’eau Eau de Toilette and Love Story).

Nomade Jasmin Naturel Chloé,"Writing this review because I received jasmin naturel instead of naturelle (yay false advertising!!!), and I am not a fan if I’m being honest. Very creamy jasmine, to the point of this being a solar beachy scent. Reminds me a lot of tom ford orchid soleil which is a heady, creamy, sunscreeny white floral scent. Will be getting a refund for my falsely advertised perfume 🙃",11/03/25 14:12,Futonbean
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Chloé,"I wanted to try Jasmine Naturel because I absolutely love Nomade Nuit d’Egypte. I wore a sample of Jasmine Naturel for a couple of days and I came to the conclusion that this flanker was not for me unfortunately. It has an overpowering sweet candle wax scent in the middle, reminds me of like a synthetic Christmas candle that I can’t ignore in this composition. I do enjoy the base notes once the candle wax is gone.
However Jasmine Naturel’s place in this series of perfume is justified in my opinion, it does make sense in the Nomade line up, because it still has something similar to the other ones :)",09/08/25 12:09,MrsCrow
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Chloé,"At the time when I smelled this at the duty-free store, I really liked how light and almost delicate it smelled. After purchasing, over time I've grown to dislike it and find myself having to layer with other scents. It's not entirely bad but maybe it's the combination of the dates and jasmine together that slowly made me dislike it the more I wore it. Something smelled off unfortunately and I don't reach for this very often. I do like layering it with Valaya Exclusif to give the jasmine note a powdery scent.",08/29/25 13:26,alannorr
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Chloé,"This is my favorite everyday perfume, for some reason Utopia Vanilla Coco from Kayali smells like an extremely intense version of this for me, and I love both. I love vanilla perfumes that are sweet but not in a tacky or boozy way, and this is exactly it. It smells like a lovely breeze in spring. It is definitely a spring/autumn fragrance for the city. Not super strong or powerful, so perfect for anyone sensitive or for work. Price is great too. For anyone looking for an everyday sweet, lightly seductive and elegant perfume, this is a safe bet.",08/03/25 08:48,loveitsalright
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Chloé,"This scent smells like listening to “A Natural Woman” by Aretha Franklin while strolling through a beautiful European city. You’re in a simple but beautiful flowing dress, the sun is out, there’s a soft breeze, and you’re walking along cobblestone streets. You’re totally down to earth, yet somehow all eyes are on you because something about you just RADIATES. This perfume feels more like an “aura” as opposed to a fragrance.

With all that said, my full bottle will be here by Wednesday.

EDIT:
9/18/2025 disappointed to say that after wearing this a few more times, the date note is so strong it’s transformed the overall scent overbearingly sweet. I don’t “dislike” it but it’s quickly become a “only wear on the back of my clothes to save my nose” type of scent.",07/27/25 10:21,BerryBizarre
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Chloé,"I wouldn't even have sniffed the bottle, were it not that I was looking for a perfume for my daughter who strongly believes in flowers and brightness. Myself, i am more the oriental/vanilla type. But Chloé got me head over heels on first sniff. It is breathtaking. Everyone in the house loves this and I have to defend my bottle fiercely or it will be empty in no time.

This scent is fairly linear over time, although I love it the very most at one-two hours in. I honestly couldn't say which one of the notes is so strong and consistent. It makes me think of candied jasmine/fig/fruity iced tea. It's bright, botanical, airy, sunny, sweet, innocent but certainly not to be overlooked. It's everything I wish for (including the vanilla). It reminds me of the blue coloured booklet of Papier d'Armenie, which is very lovely.",06/15/25 13:24,zapling
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Chloé,"Bought this on a short layover while on vacation, and at first I wasn't sure if I'd made a good choice. But after using it a couple times, I've come to adore it! The jasmine is luminous, the sandalwood cozy, and the bergamot gives it a freshness that eliminates the risk of being cloying. Absolutely addictive.",06/13/25 14:30,Se7enpointstar
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Chloé,"So happy with this blind buy! I mean I knew I would probably love it anyways given my love for gourmands and my general love for the Nomade collection. This is a feminine and lightly sweet beauty.

@Metamystic's comment literally took the words out of my mouth. Literally, retweet everything they said.
I was nervous the date note would be sticky and cloying, but it's just the right amount of sweet, with the jasmine in the background keeping this light and feminine. The notes of this fragrance all blend so seamlessly together, it just makes sense.

This blind buy success only further excites me to look into expanding my Nomade collection, especially Nuit d'Egypte!",05/29/25 08:18,liliazeib
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Chloé,"Alright, sampling this made something click. Now I understand what Nuit d’Égypte is doing in the Nomade range. Jasmin Naturel feels like the sweet step that leads you toward the mystical, sacred Egyptian night. At the same time, it’s the softer, more luminous sister of the original Nomade, which I deeply love.

This kind of sweetness I can get behind, it's not sticky or cloying. The jasmine is bright and immediate, but sadly, it doesn’t linger much in the dry down (it is a top note, sure), but I had secretly hoped for a trace to remain. I’ve been on a jasmine kick lately, so maybe my expectations were a little too high, but even so, this fragrance is beautifully done. The longevity is good, the blend feels polished and intentional, and it continues what I love most about the Nomade line.",05/18/25 08:10,MetaMystic
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Chloé,"By far THE best blind buy ever! Absolutely gorgeous fragrance! Extravaganza mentioned it reminds her of the original Roberto Cavalli in the pink snake bottle, and I am inclined to agree with this smart observation! All I know for sure is that I adored the original Roberto Cavalli perfume–what an absolute masterpiece!–and I adore this too! It's easy to wear, you can wear it anytime – day or night, summer or winter, and the scent is absolutely divine! Longevity is good; it lasts easily 5+ hours, and on clothes even more! Keep in mind that some perfume influencers on YouTube are trying to manipulate you into buying the intense version–mostly because they receive commission for that–but the intense version is not my cup of tea at all, and in my opinion, the intense version is a waste of money. It's 100% your choice, of course! I consider Nomade Jasmin Naturel one of the best perfumes I have in my collection, and I highly recommend it!",05/06/25 07:58,AVeryBlueSunday
Nomade Jasmin Naturel Chloé,"This is not the same as Naturelle. The jasmine was no where to be found in Naturelle, which was disgustingly sweet and almost like an overripe banana.

Nomade Jasmin Naturel Chloé,"Opens with banana lollies and jasmin… then settles into a Jasmin gourmand.. smells nutty gourmand, almost like nougat on my skin.

Nomade Jasmin Naturel Chloé,"FOR THOSE CONFUSED: Chloe pulled ""Nomade Naturelle"" and replaced it with this version, which is VERY similar -- but slightly different. It is hard to discern the differences without smelling them side-by-side, but I find the bergamot to make this a bit less syrupy, and the jasmine blooms even more in the dry down. Personally, I love it! And I think (and hope) those who loved the original will still enjoy this version.",10/15/24 11:47,thecellophaneflower

Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I left review to this perfume in 2021 somewhere below. It did not like back then but I never get rid of the bottle. This smell confused me in the range “is it love or hate?”. I never wore since then.

I recently decided to give it a try again. And I realized i should apply this EDT very sparingly, just a slight bit on my chest, spray from the distance. This way the fragrance opens up nicely. I think my skin intensifies the aromas. It is easy to overspray it. Or, perhaps it is not my skin, it is the fragrance. It is meant to be laid gently, in small quantity.

Now I totally understand this aroma. It has harmony and charm. I call it “soft chypre”- with some flower and fruits lingering in there.

The drydown is absolutely heavenly.

I am so glad I kept this bottle.",07/19/25 10:22,Domina1
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This is a bright fruity and clean musk on my skin. The EDP version gets a little raunchy and dirty on my skin especially in the heat. The EDT is the perfect summer chypre for me. Lasts very well on clothing and skin, although fewer hours than the EDP, as one would expect.",07/16/25 14:15,Lauren387
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"A lighter, fruiter take on the edp with the edges rounded out. I’m no tropical fruit expert so I couldn’t tell you if it’s guava but it definitely has a tropical fruit vibe. The oakmoss in the base really does it for me. It’s easygoing fruity floral and serious earthiness balancing one another, really beautifully. Imagine pretty girls, having fun, drinking pretty fruity cocktails and everybody’s direct deposit from their big girl job just hit.",04/24/25 20:17,Showard3
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Smells kind of like a fancy hotel. Getting a cinnamon-like top note for some reason. Overall, smells vaguely of spiced fruit over a light mossy base. Has a synthetic quality and suffers from overblending, but smells okay. Fairly light, good for wearing to work.",03/17/25 07:30,camellia_sinensis
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I agree with everyone who said that this is the EDP’s shy, awkward little sister. I bought this with the hope that she’d be a lighter version of the EDP that would be more suited for daily wear, but the absence of wood notes in the base (imo, what makes the EDP sultry, slightly gritty, and special) almost makes this scent too safe and not as interesting as she could be. I like it a little better after layering with Jo Malone Wood Sage & Sea Salt, but I think I still prefer the EDP overall. Not a terrible value for the price, but fell a little short of my expectations!",01/08/25 11:43,ncindyh
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I wanted to love the edp so much but turns out the edt is so much better! Less woody, fruitier fresher and more interesting! I wish Chloe would not discontinue this version

I thought that I'm not gonna love it as the notes are not usual for me and given that I'm into more citrusy, floral, and fresh (although I have sweet and gourmand perfume lol). It took a while before I buy this and voila, I got this with huge discount! Another signature scent of mine for sure. Because of this perfume, I discovered that I'm into mossy perfume as it smells beautiful on my skin on its dry-down. Smells fruity, fresh, and sophisticated for me, and if you gonna ask me, this perfume is unconventional and I wanna gatekeep this (haha). Lasts longer also, which I DO LOVE! Can recommend it to those who love chypre scent who loves oakmoss as base notes.",11/19/24 00:04,athenaxvivienne

I own the EDT and dont get ANY peach in it. But I do get a lot of ""guava"" on it too, although not as in-your-face- ish. In the EDT it is accompanied by a refreshing lichee and smells waaay less sweet than in the EDP.
So if there is a chance what disturbs you might be the mirabelle and not only the peach, you might not like the EDT too, because it is still very fruity. But it is still a lighter, fresher, more transparent scent than the original.",08/06/24 18:15,vike.s

Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This was a blind buy that I originally regretted. My first experience with this scent was horrible. On paper, strong oak moss was all I smelled; it was very off-putting. It sat on a shelf for awhile.
Recently, I was decluttering my collection, and decided to revisit it before selling. I'm now undecided.

On my skin, it is a warm spicy/woody fragrance, with light florals and a hint of musk in the background. It feels full and well rounded.
In the air (or on clothing) it smells very flat and synthetic. The smell you get from Christmas decorations when they've just been pulled from storage.

For me, the main drawback is sillage and strength: they're too strong for my taste. This last 1-2 days in the air, on my clothing, and skin; regardless of showering/washing.
I find this overpowering and a bit annoying. I get headaches from powerful sillage, and also don't want to commit to a single fragrance for two days in a row.

I'll probably end up selling this.",08/09/23 14:45,martel.308

Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,Straight up guava. You know those guava candies? It's like that. Good stuff if I were into fresh fruity perfumes for warm days. I've been going back and forth about whether I should get a bottle.,06/12/23 01:07,khawater
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I think this is useful. I choose it often. It's not my favourite and it's not like anything else I own but it is lovely and it's just the ticket for when you've had a bath in the evening and then have some things to potter about and do, like tax returns or watering the garden. It's bright, and sensual without being sexy. It's fresh fruit and swimming pools, it's clean towels and Darjeeling.",05/17/23 15:04,Indianrunnerduck
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I've chosen this as my everyday scent of 2023. Well-blended to the point where it's hard to place it in one olfactory category. Fresh, fruity, floral, woody...it has it all. At the same time, it isn't confusing to the nose. I love a good ""je ne sais quoi"" scent, and this is it. If you're looking for a signature scent that isn't easy to define, but smells easy and uplifting, this is a great option.
PS Also a great option for those who found the patchouli to be a little too sweaty in the original Nomade. The EDT is gentler and brighter.",05/17/23 03:21,thecellophaneflower
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Yes, it is brighter & lighter than the EDP, but in being brighter & lighter it loses what makes the EDP so special to me; that balmy warmth that transports me to Laurel Canyon in the ‘70s, open windows, bare feet, sunlight through leaves, wildflower bouquets. This feels much…safer, borderline pedestrian. But for many people, this EDT will be much more approachable, due in large part to the addition of lychee which gives this a very clean, perfume-y smell, not unlike the soapy bite of the much-beloved Chloé EDP. For me, this lychee note smells the way perfume tastes when you accidentally catch some in your mouth. It’s not an unpleasant perfume over all, but I miss the courage of the EDP which smells so gorgeously lived in & self-assured & sexy. This EDT is the shyer, paler sister.

9/14/23 EDIT:

Ok—I feel compelled to amend this review after spending more time with this fragrance over the summer; yes, it is more tame & more approachable than it’s deeper, more sensuous sister, the EDP; yes, it lacks some of the EDP’s lush, bohemian charm. However, it retains the EDP’s warmth & scintillating quality; in the EDP this quality feels jammy, in the EDT it is juicier. If the EDP is barefoot & suntanned & arrives to the party in a bell sleeved linen blouse & no bra, the EDT arrives in faded jeans & rattan mules; similar spirit, but not as given over. It is brighter, lighter, & fresher than the EDP; think of warm summer days when the clouds cast shadows & you eat a peach that leaves your fingers sticky as you ride your bike beneath trees thick with August. This fragrance is memorable, though not as strident as the EDP, & it maintains that bronzed, fuzzy, lived-in feeling that the EDP captures, even if this one is slightly more posh. I have caught the tremulous ghost of this fragrance rising in a warm cloud between my bedsheets on many a summer night, & each time it has made me smile: rosy, juicy, dreamy. What I love about the Nomade line is its vision: I see the woman who I imagine embodying these perfumes. The EDP is a woman who takes each day as it comes, she doesn’t need a plan because she knows herself, she is self-assured, free spirited, & unapologetic. The EDT is the woman who is becoming the aforementioned woman; she’s hopeful, aspirational, & stronger than she seems. If you’re on the fence, I advise you stick with her.",04/24/23 20:20,❤️🔥🧿plutobabe🔮🌾
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Too much freesia. And quite a bit of moss.

It would be nice to smell on someone else but I find the freesia overwhelming on my skin. I prefer the EDP and absolu which I feel balance out the florals better.

It is clean and would be suitable for a professional environment, I had high hopes of wearing this to work but I am going to have to pass.",04/02/23 13:27,Luckyed
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,This is so so so pretty! Chypre has never been this modern or beautiful. This is an airy chypre scent. The lychee in the beginning adds this juicy start to the scent that just makes it extremely likeable.,03/27/23 07:49,lmnsvgz
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I ordered the duo set and got an EDP instead of the EDT I ordered. It's not that different that the EDT but it IS different and I would prefer the EDT. I have a huge collection of perfume and as I head towards seventy a whole knowledge base. I'm so pleased I stocked up on some classics before Covid because they are now so hard to get and much more expensive. I don't buy many mainstream perfumes these days and I wear a great many that are loved by me that never fired commercially. As an example I love the remake of Balmain's Ivoire with a bottle that can't help being insanely chic; it was inexpensive. Mine is not to reason why but Chloe Nomade keeps me interested. It is tart and stroppy but not vulgar, lasts all day. Buy the EDT.",02/12/23 15:04,courant
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Nomade EDT is the 'lighter' flanker, but still very potent, linear scent that lasts and lasts... no opening, middle notes, or dry down, it's exactly the same hours after you've sprayed it, no need to reapply. Have about half a bottle left, but can't bring myself to wear it anymore. I only use it as a room spray nowadays, on the inside of my curtains, just to use it up. I get what dancingdear said before me, one spray goes a long way. Nothing subtle about this one, screams 'perfume!' to everyone in the vicinity.",11/12/22 22:44,C8
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This is nice. I like to wear this Eau de Toilette MUCH BETTER than the Eau de Parfum. It’s a lot more wearable, not as heavy or obnoxious.

Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,Better than the original :),08/05/22 19:38,Sarahaahaha
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This is so sad to me.
I sprayed my wrist and ten seconds later my roommate (who was upstairs) said “are you wearing perfume?” One spray!
I loved how the scent developed the sweetness of the litchi blended so well into the earthier notes. The citrus and mirabelle definitely prevent the rose becoming too strong. Unique but still a very wearable scent.
It dried down and I really had to sniff my wrist to get the beautiful scent.
Later that day I saw my parents who said “you are wearing a lot of perfume!” ONE SPRAY!
It seems I am nose blind to a very strong fragrance.

I had to return it 🥲
If I could barely smell it but all my loved ones were taken aback by the strength it wasn’t worth it.

This doesn’t seem to be a common occurrence so definitely worth trying for yourself because it is a really wonderful scent.",07/23/22 01:11,dancingdear
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"To me, it's way better than the edp version. Although it's an edt, it lasts long and projects really well. It's modern, clean and classy, well-made, suitable for many occasions from workplace to even a bridal fragrance. I'm not a fan of the chypre type (or even Chloe fragrances in general), but this one has really captivated me! The bitterness in it is so sweet, if that makes any sense, and the flowers are crystalline.",06/16/22 06:49,kikio
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I honestly love this. The litchi here gives a tart, fruity, masculine leaning twist, but doesn't take the fragrance full unisex imo. I love that about litchi. But the freesia and rose keep it airy. Also thrilled about the oakmoss in the base, I don't see that as a prominent base note nearly as much as I'd like to.",05/24/22 22:44,Decarabats
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"<3
Even the EDT blows my mind, I just can’t be happier about these 3 pieces really, it’s so rare that I am equally fascinated by all flnkers of a line. I guess a lot of sophisticated noses are quite picky and mostly underwhelmed by contemporary mainstream fragrances, and go for vintage or niche, but it doesn’t apply to me.
I appreciate designer houses’s current approach blending just a handful amount of notes -
I personally don’t need a massive olfactory pyramid like in big vintages, or the exact opposite approach in niche perfumery, with it’s quite minimalistic style.",04/06/22 15:39,mothtoaflame___
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,I'm not sure how to feel of it as it smells kinda sugary and a bit fruity at first and it turns sorta masculine smell.. Its not a hate or a like but it confuses me. But it does have better longevity on me so can't complain much as I blind bought it without second thought when introduced.,02/16/22 18:50,Ann92
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,This is honestly really lovely—a simple fruity green stunner. Biggest letdown is the longevity on me…that fruity opening disappears immediately on me. Still enjoy this a lot and look forward to wearing it in warmer months,01/28/22 01:11,asg6
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,It is my favourite fruity floral perfume for now. It is quite likeable but still unique. The oakmoss adds a little bitter vibe to the sour-sweet base. It makes me happy every time I wear it and it was the only perfume I wanted to wear for more than a month after purchasing it.,01/24/22 12:59,OlhaM
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"It's a nice perfume but nothing to be crazy about. It shares like 65% with the edp but lacks the kick that makes the edp so beautiful and unique. It's like the shy younger sister who shares the same genes and main features with her older gorgeous sister but she's not as perfect as her. This is perfect if the edp is too strong for you or if you want to reapply during the day on the top of it. Longevity and sillage are impressive for such a light airy eau de toilette.

Edit after more wears: I underestimated it. Although not as deep and unique as the edp but equally beautiful. On my skin it turns powdery and the strong litchi note fades away which I prefer. I like it a lot.",01/15/22 04:46,Lamiawitipo

Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Fresh sweetness (must be the litchee) on the first spray, dries down to a soft calm base. A modern fragrance well done, it is not cloying at all and the lasting power is a solid 10/10. It's just that I'm not a huge fan of oakmoss so I don't think I'll be getting a bigger bottle of this (glad I sampled it before blind buying it), the duration of Nomade on your skin is like 20% of litchee and the rest of 80% will be oakmoss. If you are new to earthy tones or woody blends, this is a very subtle one to start off with.

P.S. I love the design of the bottle but I wish the name had been different",09/07/21 20:02,highbymybay
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This is beautiful, elegant fruity floral with an edge from the oak moss that stops it from being too mature. This is the modern Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet. So easy to wear. If you love lychee and oak moss then this is a safe blind buy.",08/03/21 10:24,Sreza7
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I LOVE this perfume! Nomade EDT is fresher, brighter and lighter than the original EDP. I find it opens with a citrusy note, but it must be the litchi. It dries down to smell clean and fresh, floral and beautiful. It is somewhat linear. This perfume would suit any age - it is youthful yet mature at the same time! It lasts several hours on my skin and is never overpowering. It is absolutely perfect for spring, summer, probably even fall, but would maybe be too light for winter. When it comes to comparing the EDT and EDP, I'm also a huge fan of the EDP. I love them both. The EDT to me is better for a hot summer day when you want a more fresh, citrus feel. The only downside of the EDT is that it isn't super easy to find - I don't see it on as many sites as I'd like but safe to say I'm definitely upgrading my mini bottle to full size as soon as possible.

EDIT: I bought a full size of the EDT and love it. One of my go-to scents this summer. Now I am finished my travel size of the EDP so a full-size of that one is on my list next. Then, to try the Absolu :)",07/07/21 11:54,thewildrosebud
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Very different from the original. This one is brighter, more alive, yet so relaxing. Very well blended and balanced. The smell of clear skin but even better.

Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"nomade edt, summer test, skin, also tested absolute and edp

edt is bright, white or yellow fruits and possibly a white flower giving the light airyness to it. this is not as mossy and earthy as the other two though the moss and woods are detectable giving this a non garden non gourmand take on fruit.
the fruit is semi juicy initially, not sharp.
i would need to test this on its own and i think this whole line needs a skin test in different seasons, the edt is not very detectable though i think had i tested this in the later arvo i would be able to discern it alot more (plus i have another scent on elsewhere).
bright sillage, not great longevity, airy take on fruit+mossy",11/15/20 15:56,dglightblue
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I've heard a lot about this brave modern chypre and bought a big bottle of it and a small bottle of absolu edp, because of the notes and my sincere belief that Quentin Bisch can do no wrong.

Based on the comments below, I must be the only one that gets the ""Nomade"" reference all to well. As every journey, it starts with a promise of something wonderfull, you are awake, fresh out of the shower and smell of tropical fruits and flowers. Very nice. The sun comes out, it's warming up and after a couple of hours arises the need, known to all the nomads, the need of shower, increasing with every step. It is absolutely horrible in confined places like planes, cars and small rooms. At first I thought it smelled like sweaty skin or wet leather/suide, but leather is not listed at all. Fake oakmoss, is that it? The drydown gives off some metall iodine notes as a faint wiff of Baccarat 540 would.

The same happens with Absolu edp and it saddens me greatly. It is early days and I have only worn both in summer. I hope colder weather does some magic to my poor bottles, otherwise it is curtains for both.",08/24/20 05:18,PerfumeForLainy
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I totally missed I had a sample of the EDT, but discovered it yesterday, so went ahead and sprayed it once on my wrist (around noon). I could smell it all day, without having to bring my nose to where I sprayed, and it was still there when I woke up this morning! Pretty impressive, given this is an EDT.

This has, however, nothing to do with a nomade in my opinion (who moves from one place to another), or a tanned woman with boots on, horses and a desert (commercial), as I did not pick up on anything woody or earthy at all. Instead, it just kept being floral (freesia) and fruity (litchi). It’s not tropical or solar to me either. The EDP might be more up my alley, given the more ‘masculine’ base notes.

Overall, I did find this a very elegant longlasting fruity/floral that I would imagine on a confident but kind, sophisticated woman of 40+, who prefers luxury and never wears casual clothing, always chic.",06/30/20 06:11,It's an addiction
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Interesting, lively, spicy, sunny, tropical. Slightly elegant in a bit of retro style, but also young and modern.
It's funny, but Chloe Nomade seems to be my ""on-off"" perfume relationship - I always come back, even to the flankers.
In the heat it develops not only a fruity, but almost a vegetable smell on my skin, possibly an effect of the green oakmoss. Sounds a bit weird, but just that makes it interesting enough for me to wear it more often. I think I'm the person who needs a bit of weirdness in her scents to keep the interest going (except for my ""safe"" perfumes for work). So it is an ""almost office-safe perfume"" with an edge. For an eau de toilette, longevity is great and it unfolds different layers. And certainly it contains more notes (in the deep drydown I discover the same sandalwood as in the Edp and also a little shy cinnamon, which I can usually smell in the top notes of the Absolu).
IMO the bottle and the images in the ad match the frag perfectly. Nomade is uplifting and free-spirited.",06/25/20 11:23,Astara_Elaria

Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"This is Nomade with oakmoss and patchouli both greatly toned down. A much lighter and delicate chypre, mixed with dominant sweet floral fruity notes. The result is even fresher than the original, supported by citrusy undertones. Pretty soft and inoffensive, the EdT is easy to wear in the office and in the heat, but it doesn't have the dirty retro unisex vibe of the EdP that makes it so special to me. A safe choice for those who want an easygoing and girly version of Nomade.",11/07/19 13:33,Rose du soir
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"If I’m going to describe this using a popular fragrance this reminds me of Dior’s Blooming Bouquet but less peony/rosy and more fruity, peachy and musky. This also has that “pretty girl” vibe that Blooming Bouquet has.",11/06/19 22:17,smellynich
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I just love this move toward oakmoss in the Nomade line.

As for the toilette, I wish the freshness of that first blast could be sustained, but alas it dries down to a whisper of what it once was. I guess this is safer for office wear.

I prefer the EDP, that mirabelle and patchouli makes it last longer. The EDP is also way more woody and resinous, it smells more like a christmas scent in comparison to this offering. I like this one on its own terms, but I can't see myself buying both.",10/05/19 11:55,colorfulmess
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,This version is very similar to the original just lighter. The lychee gives this a slightly tropical vibe which makes it a nice summer fragrance.

Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"I Nomade EdT brings femininity to a market of unisex perfumes, loud sweet creations and water down flankers.
It gives a vibe from the early 80’s, it starts bright and sunny, almost too simple and naive. But slowly grows and spread like a wild bugainvillea in summertime. The innocent freesia becomes a sexy sweet tropical flower thanks to the Lychee. It exudes confidence and sensuality.
The oakmoss is noticeable but basically it gives a sort of structure to the other notes.
I wouldn’t hesitate to buy it as a secret weapon for special occasions;)",07/08/19 13:50,esteban747
Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Finally got a chance to try this, let me just say to me it was another case of love at first sniff and chemistry wise it just worked. Will do a full review later on need more time to get to know Nomade EDT chances are I'll still be getting the EDP as well.

But a small first impressions:

Upon spraying it I'm hit with a mix fruity/floral notes and upon drydown it still remains there I have yet to pick up on any oak moss however as I only detect the Lychee and Freesia.

Just received it in the mail today
Definetly smell the litchi and oak moss . Litchi is very unique smell, almost sour smelling and the oak moss adds this “dirty/ earthy vibe to it ,, freesia balances it out
,,, all In all it’s a scent I’ve never smelt before
VERY FEMININE , VERY STRONG , SPRAY LIGHTY , TO ME IT CAN BECOME CLOYING / OVERPOWERING if sprayed too much .

Nomade Eau de Toilette Chloé,"Weirdly, upon initial spray it smells like Indian food to me lol. It smells like the green chutney that you're supposed to dip samosas in. Something about this perfume is cilantro-y like the chutney. Maybe it's the strange blend of oak moss, freesia and lychee. The original is a lot more solid and has more substance to it. The dry down of this is pure freesia. A very, very basic freesia that is borderline nauseating. Very late 90s/early 2000s bath and body works. I adore how cute and unique the bottle is though.",03/19/19 17:22,chicagogirl
