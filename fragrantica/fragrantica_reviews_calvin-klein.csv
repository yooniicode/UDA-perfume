Eternity 25th Anniversary Edition for Women Calvin Klein,"This smells a like masculine cologne to be honest. In the beginning it's spicy, musky and strong however after a while the dry down emits a green herbal scent. A good unisex fragrance for the office. But it cannot be a signature scent for a woman. It's too strong but after dry down it becomes a little flowery.",12/10/22 04:27,natasha calli
Eternity 25th Anniversary Edition for Women Calvin Klein,"Received this today....%$#&!!!
What did they do with the CARNATION...!!!...???
All I get is an aquatic/herbal/sage scent...and later in the dry-down phase....MAYBE...a touch of floral...lily??? REALLY???
This is NOT white floral to my nose at all....I guess I can feel the marigold...bitterness...more like a vintage men's cologne..very dry..WEiRd !!!!
At first spritz...I thought..What's going on here ???
I will admit..that when it dries down it gets better, but...this one is a NO Way Jose IMHO.
I gave this 2 chances today, both with the same result.
Sometimes I wait a couple days and try it again...since I spent the $$$...I will try it again....or maybe not.
Sigh....sigh.

EDIT: The bottle IS cool,I admit that.
Read the review below mine....I think that sums it up !!!",08/25/17 12:43,mapache

Cotton Musk Body Mist Calvin Klein,"The scent is more like coconut than cotton. I sometimes use this spray as air freshener.

I think it's very overpriced, considering it's marketed as a body mist rather than a perfume. Mists tend to be more targeted at teens in my opinion, and teens typically spend £1-10 on them.",08/05/25 05:22,christiine77

Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,"I totally agree with the review of ""sp00kie"".....this is not a summer fragrance.
Cooler weather, spring or Fall. Ones the top notes are gone which is a few minutes, it becomes too deep and heavy to wear it in the Summer.",12/02/22 03:13,palimadar
Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,"A super release that has nothing to do with any Eternity flanker before it. A step in a new direction before Summer Daze brought it back on course. I wonder if this was a record-scratch one-off-type deal. Either way, this is one of my favorite Eternity releases. I'm going for this one in the evening when I want to smell exotic and approachable.

An air of mystery to this for sure, as noted in previous comments. I think this is because you don't often get these gorgeous notes altogether: Right out the gates, this is rich, sensual, and spicy with lovely tropical touches from the coconut. Generally, not a fan of coconut scents but this one changed my mind completely and made me inspired to go out and get more.

Let me say something about the finish here: Shocking. Unfolds onto such a delicate, dusty Sandalwood with deep Labdanum and sweet, sweet Frankincense. Why isn't this more popular?

You have to love Calvin Klein's wild scent notes and weird off-the-wall futurism - It totally puts some people off but I can't get enough of it. CK is the best fragrance out there for the money if you ask me, so take that with a grain of salt. CK is a brand that has held high brand recognition and respect, even though they end up at bargain stores like Ross and TJ Maxx. In short, nobody is going to smell like you and this will get compliments if you are looking for that sort of thing.

Make sure you check the outer box, recent years look similar, but you can't really go wrong, to be honest. Compared to everything else out right now, CK Eternity Summer editions hold up.",09/02/22 09:46,Ceau de Parfum
Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,"This fragrance is a little confusing I won’t lie. At first spray I smelled absolutely nothing just a burst of alcohol, i put more sprays because it’s very very light you could barely smell anything and I still didn’t smell anything after spraying more. Later I drove to work and started smelling nothing but leather all the way through, although there is no note of leather in this fragrance and there no comments mentioning leather that was all i got. It’s weird because as soon as I got to work i got compliments from my co-workers although I could barely smell it on myself. I will say the performance gets much better after about 4 hours, you could smell it after wearing it for a while it definitely works better in high heat. After about that 4 hours you also get a lot of woodiness and a dash of coconut. It’s more a spring than summer fragrance but would work great for both. All in all It’s a solid fragrance for a beginner.",07/01/22 09:40,ishootlikeaking
Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,"What a disappointment this is. Doesn’t last at all. 30 minutes and it’s gone. You have to shove your face wherever you applied it to maybe get a whiff of something. Got this at Burlington for $22, good price. Terrible performance. 👎",06/19/22 14:21,antoneux
Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,"Tried this today with Hugo Boss Unlimited, preferred Eternity Summer , hands down. Also lasted way longer 6+ hours.

Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,Very strange yet good smell. Its refreshing spicy kinda of smell. If you want to try something new this is excellent. Remember its like any other yearly edition from CK it might not be available all the time so grab one now.,10/18/21 13:27,Sam_NY_89
Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,"For some reason, Hawaii is the first thing that came to my mind when I first sprayed this on. Unlike the going trend, I find the scent interesting and dare say kinda unique. I can't think of anything else that smells similar.
Comparing this to the 2019 version, I think this is much fresher, and way less salty. You should go for the 2019 if you want to be reminded of the beach/the sea and the OG Eternity. This shouldn't even be an Eternity flanker in my opinion, as it has its own character without much of the OG DNA.
To round this up, don't listen to the haters: you and everyone else around will love this! Blind purchase approved. ❤️
And a closing question: does anyone know for a fact who the perfumers are? Calvin Klein's HK website lists Pascal Gaurin.
Update: I literally had someone run after me to ask what I was wearing. LOL!",09/22/21 14:22,kalilax
Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,"I'm with sp00kie down there. A mineral sandy, dune environment accord is all that reminds me of summer, the rest being a balmy all year round pleasing, nurturing scent for 4 hs. I discern no coconut whatsoever in this, as opposed to Eternity Now, which is a realistic coconut meat (not milk) frag. Eternity for men Summer 2019 feels more summer-like than this. I suppose the parfumiers spent the summer of 2020 indoors? In any case, I really like this scent and I use it all year round, day and night.",07/06/21 15:53,sapeur1999
Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein Eternity for Men Summer 2020 is a bit a tough nut to crack. It is rather unique since Eternity for Men Summer 2020 is a fresh tropical spicy-green fragrance. It is somewhat tropical with the heavy coconut, there is some spice with the sage and anise. As for green, the closest is maybe the sage. Honestly I don't know why but this smells a little bit like Tommy Hilfiger Summer 2016 and a less sea salty 2019 Eternity for Men Summer.

Surprisingly, this was the fragrance that got me more into coconut. Normally it has either been dominated by rum like in Joop! Homme Wild or just come off like suntan lotion like with Set Sails Martinque or English Laundry Tahitian Waters. Now while I do like coconut rum, I got more of the booze than the coconut in most cases with coconut fragrance.

With Eternity for Men Summer 2020, I get a coconut water smell. Sadly, this is the only thing that makes the fragrance stand out and it dies into a hardly noticeable olibanum and sandalwood mixture. Now don't get me wrong, I do get sage, anise and bergamot in the open but, really this fragrance is mostly coconut.

Eternity for Men Summer 2020 is a typical CK release in performance. It lasts 4 hours and doesn't project all that strong after the first hour. For this reason it is a nice spring/summer errand and work fragrance. It may work on vacations, but not as easily as the previous years' Eternity for Men Summer release which is a vacation ready scent. Don't get me wrong Eternity for Men Summer 2020 does smell nice, but it isn't as good of summer vacation scent as past Eternity for Men summer releases.

Calvin Klein Eternity for Men Summer 2020 is nice but it isn't a must go out and get fragrance. It is unique-ish but not that very uesful. I list it as a like but that is because I ""like"" any fragrance I rank a 6 or higher. There really isn't anything obnoxious from the fragrance but at the same time it isn't special, it performs like a CK release and it outshined by the 2019. Is this better than the 2016 Tommy Summer release, yes. Should you get it if you enjoyed that, sure if the supply for 2016 Tommy is dry. Unless you truly love the Eternity for Men Summer releases, I think that is the only reason to get this. But really, I must give this a 6.5, 0.2 higher than the Tommy due to the added tropical feel from the coconut that gives this an added character.",07/05/21 17:24,mkpunk
Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,"The first time I smelt this, it was side by side with CK One Summer 2020. I was pretty disappointed because I made the mistake of comparing it directly to that. Don't do that.
As a stand alone summer fragrance,this is actually pretty great.
As long as you don't go into it expecting too much. I mean it is an annual summer release from Calvin Klein.
When my wife smelt it on my wrist, she wasn't a fan. But when she walked into the scent trail, she really loved it.
If you can pick this up for $20 or $25, I think you'll be completely satisfied.",06/15/21 08:41,a_c_thompson
Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,Fresh and green scent for me. A bit on the more generic side where the mass of the designers are. Easy to wear and easy to like. Nothing that will blow your mind.,05/03/21 02:31,jarno1208
Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,"It really reminds me of classic Michael Jordan which for me is one of my favorite warm weather juices ever. This is a definite recommend from me especially at the price point right now of $20-$30.
8.5/10

These flankers tend to be cheap for the first year after release and then they go up in price every year after that so snag a bottle while you can",03/18/21 09:50,Cologne_Junkie
Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,"For me this is not a summer scent. Not that I don't like it but I think it's misnamed. You might be able to wear it in summer but not during the day. The sage/bergamot opening is very pleasant but it lasts for such a short time that you can't classify it as a summer fragrance on that basis. The labdanum/sandalwood drydown is where the warmth comes from and for me it makes this the perfect fragrance for a relaxing weekend during autumn or the cooler part of spring. Performance is nothing special at 5 sprays even on clothes. It's a skin scent after 3-4 hours for me. In short, its a safe blind buy. Get it if you can find it really cheap and be prepared to overspray. It's definitely worth the 18 euros I paid for it. I will be using it in a few months.",08/10/20 13:07,sp00kie
Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,"That one is so bad, I hate it. Nothing coconutty, nothing sweet, just basic sage. I hate the original Eternity as well and this could be the reason but that smells cheap.",07/10/20 04:17,tuturudka
Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,"This ones a banger folks. Finally we get a flanker from the CK house that to me anyways isn’t a lunchbox letdown. To anybody who likes the OG Eternity for men it definitely has some of the vibes from it, but it’s clearly not the same. To my nose this is a a much softer and better smelling version of Eternity Intense with some small differences between the notes breakdown, and I love Eternity Instense, just saying. On my skin it didn’t last too long (about 3 hours) but I didn’t spray much either, a couple on the chest and couple behind the ears. I’m fairly confident that if I was a little more generous I could get between 4-5 hours. Obviously because of the name this is a warm weather scent, but it’s nice to know that CK isn’t putting out trash again and again. So far in the past year I’ve picked up Eternity EDP, and now this, they have both been exceptional. I’ll give this a solid 7/8 out of 10 because it smells really nice. I’ve even caught my GF snagging a few squirts to put on my sweaters and shirts for when I’m not around for a few days so she can wear them at night. She’s picky as hell, so they’ve done something right here on this years version. Lastly, I’ve since compared the notes between this one and Eternity Intense and it doesn’t seem to share any of the same notes, but for some reason I find that there some subtle similarities, apologies in advance for throwing any readers here a curveball with my senses.",06/30/20 21:11,DaedalusX
Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,"Really nice! Dries down warmer with a bit of smokiness, which helps its staying power. Coconut isn't very prominent, but some sweetness remains throughout. I could imagine this as a casual summer night, perfect for going out to an outdoor restaurant or tiki bar or something like that. Worth a look if you've enjoyed previous Eternity Summers and want a break from summer fragrances that go heavy on the citrus.",04/25/20 15:50,cheetspeek
Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,"This frag has just been released here in the UK,I’m not a fan of Calvin Klein but thought I’ll give this one a go as I’m looking for Summer Scents now, it’s fresh,clean and nice, basically turns into the Classic Eternity.. not bad at all.",03/26/20 10:08,tuscany
Eternity For Men Summer 2020 Calvin Klein,"Incredible, I love this version. 80% similar to eternity summer 2017, It starts with strong coconut note, and after 15 minutes it evolves to a fresh with a middle note of incense fragrance. I also note a little bit of ginger in the drydown. Overall I thinks it´s perfect for summer. I would recommend it for summer nights. Not strictly for using it to a beach trip during the day.",03/19/20 11:16,ERP27

CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein CK One Summer 2016 is one of the better iterations of the CK One Summer collection. I regard is a sort of sweet palm with mixed citruses and other fruit. Its note listing includes a mojito accord, which contrasts it from the more margarita-like vibe of its 2014 counterpart, and certainly the execution on 2016 isn’t quite as pleasant as 2014, but 2016 still does give the tropical cocktail vibe, to put it crudely, while not veering off in an overly synthetic direction at any one point. Like 2014, it’s good, not great, but certainly quite good for the money, as it’s been available in its standard 100ml size for $20 at times, surely a bargain if there are qualms over the quality. The 2017-19 version are available on FragranceNet currently for such prices, though I expect the earlier versions like 2016 and especially 2014 might start demanding higher prices. Certainly a fun try and worth tracking down for the right price, but otherwise replicable via other options in a similar sweet fruity fresh category that’s fairly ubiquitous. I’ve 2018 and 2014 as well, with 2014 being my favorite and 2018 being roughly on par with 2016.

CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,Purchased 2016 and 2014 ckos recently. My must say this one was a treat! it’s different then years past. I ejoyed this scent very much compared to 2014 ckos.. I own multiple CK One summers and 2014 is my least favorite by far,07/16/19 23:28,Mace_windu

CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"Take water, add a mojito drink into it, boom you have this cologne, but the water and mojito would probably be stronger than this cologne. It smells great but it turns into a skin scent after 30 minutes. Luckily for me I got a 100Ml for $30 bucks at a cologne expo. To me, the 2017 version has better longevity and silage. Skip this one if you’re looking for a scent that lasts longer than an hour.",10/06/18 17:21,DaedalusX
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"My husband doesn't want to give me his bottle of this fresh mojito!

CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"A nice, fresh summer frag. You can smell the original CK One in the base of this, but the addition of the mojito and coconut accords give it a little twist. You feel like you are going to the beach instead of running errands...
definitely summer. best during the day or casual evening events. longevity not great, but it never has been for CK One or its flankers. A fun alternative for the summer....",04/04/18 05:28,aet
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"Definitely a summer scent, no question about that. Smells kind of like coconut scented tanning lotion and shea butter mixed with lime/citrus and white rum. Would make a great beach scent. Very similar to Set Sail St. Barts for men by Tommy Bahama, a summer staple of mine.

CK One Summer is unquestionably unisex, leaning toward feminine, although it easily can be worn by both men and women. Nothing exciting about this one. Very safe scent and I doubt anybody will dislike this one enough to get negative reactions because it's so fresh and light it's not that noticeable anyway. Most people will have the opinion of it being just a nice summer scent, nothing more, but also not bad either.

The longevity on this however sucks. I'm talking one of the weakest in my collection of 160 fragrances and my wife's 200+ perfumes. It's hard to believe it's an EDT because it's more like a cologne. I actually get better longevity with Versace Eau Fraiche -- so if you know that fragrance, that will give you an idea of the weak performance of CK One Summer. But again, I do believe the perfumer created this for those that prefer really light fragrances. As for me, I had to double up on my usual 3 sprays and apply 6 sprays. That still barely lasted an hour. The poor projection/sillage is not a major issues with me because I wear fragrances for myself and my fragrance addicted wife and not an entire room. Even with 6 sprays,.my wife needed to literally come just a few inches from my chest to detect the scent only 15 minutes after application!

CKOS does make a nice air freshener to spritz a few times around the house, ideally just before guests arrive for a summer cookout or whatever. It does seem to get slightly better longevity on my shirt. I'll probably gift it to my wife, or perhaps swap it for something I enjoy more.",08/08/17 13:45,richmilton
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"It starts really good citrus green smell but it drysdown into this harsh woody green smell that is not comfortable to wear.

CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"I bought the 2014 version and liked it so much decided to try this version and really like it also. These are perfect for people like me who don't have a lot of cash to throw at fragrances but they still smell really good. I have to say these CK summer fragrances are really hitting out of the park with me for being good yet cheap.

I don't get the comparisons to the 2014 edition. To me this is completely different other than it's a summer oriented scent. And 2014 to me reminds me of the beach where this reminds me of a beautiful summer day.

This one is a fresh green scent but has some sweetness to it. I don't get alot of the mojito in this. I get the lime and the green and I guess it's the guava that gives the sweetness to this. But another winner in my book. Of course the longevity and projection isn't the greatest on these scents but they last long enough for me. I'd recommend the 2014 and 2016 for anyone to try.

CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"I hate the fact that I like this... I hate the fact that I like it, and I hate the fact that it's strong as HECK for being a fresh scent. And it's only $18 on Notino. Seriously, it's frustrating for me, after spending $75 on a large bottle of Dior Homme Cologne as my ""go-to"" clean scent! I'm not saying it's going to replace my beloved Dior Homme Cologne, but this is a really good clean scent none the less!

For some reason, people keep including samples of this when I swap with them, and I'll be d*mned, it's pleasant to say the least. Even if you don't like CK One, the added coconut/mojito vibe is a very nice addition to that scent.

Smells like a day at the pool, in a bottle.

Don't get me wrong, it won't replace my favorite fresh scent and I won't be buying a full bottle, but the decants I have of this will surely get used.

With that being said, this scent makes a great gift.",05/22/17 09:02,TonyAKAMrClean
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"One of the best Ck one summers!
The bottle itself is gorgeous as is the scent.
It smells almost identical to the 2014 version but with a little mint in the backround.
The notes that stand out the most are lime,coconut,mint and some spice thrown in, the perfect summertime scent!
Its more on the masculine side but not overly thanks to the coconut.",03/04/17 15:23,GabeD812
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"I bought this yesterday. Amazing scent specially the opening...alas, longevity and sillage are so poor.

Edit :Well after trying it for two days.... it did get noticed after less than an hour of applying and i got a compliment from a friend who thought it smelled fantastic. Well after like 9 hours i did get whiffs of it and this one performs much better in high heat.",08/24/16 00:21,sergeMS
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"Got my bottle today and decided to try it out for work. Honestly I am quite impressed for a cheapie, as the longevity, at least on me, is right up there with some of the best daytime performers I have. I get solid whiffs of it for the first 4-5 hours, then I only get whiffs of it every so often from the 6-8 hour mark. But once I get home and take a whiff from inside my undershirt, I can clearly still smell it.

As for the smell, well, after a full days use I am going to classify this scent in the same category as Mugler Cologne (which I really enjoy). There is this inherent clean freshness vibe to it, and it doesn't really come across like a cologne/perfume kinda smell, but rather a 'fresh out of shower' soapy-clean kinda smell. Just like Mugler cologne does.

I would even go out on a limb and say that if Thierry Mugler were to ever come out with a flanker to Mugler Cologne, this could have easily been it. Perhaps aptly named: Mugler Cologne - Tropical Summer.

The smell is bright, green, mildly sweet on opening, clean, fresh and tropical. And just like Mugler Cologne, this is the perfect fragrance to simply freshen up on, without making a statement that you are wearing cologne/perfume. I would say this is the perfect frag to spritz on before doing some yard work in the middle of summer, or using as a summertime work scent to remind you and others around you about those fun vacations, or just for hanging around the home taking in the summertime vibes. Yes, I would say this is definitely a summertime only kinda scent. But it could always be used in the dead of winter to remind you that summer is only a few months away (scent memory is kinda fun that way).

If you enjoy frags that are of the ""clean, fresh, out of shower"" type of scents, then this should be right up your alley. And if you enjoy Mugler Cologne as a scent, then I highly recommend you check out CK One Summer 2016 while it is still readily available at a cheap price.",08/20/16 00:29,ITBoa
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"Just received it today, this is one of the most beautiful scent from CK One Summer Line, it smells like 2014 version but sweeter, the coconut is very prominent in this, and that's a good thing, it blends perfectly with mojito, that makes it magical. I'm gonna wear this on my vacation to Vietnam & Thailand next week, this is perfect for hot summer holiday",08/02/16 01:25,rickyfreaky13
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"So I've worn this a total of 4 wearing a now and I've already got this fragrance down as its a very easy fragrance to understand.

This opens up very citrusy,bright with that lime and mohito accord and then it quickly dies down to a very fresh,pleasant soapy green scent that's also slightly creamy what I guess is from that coconut note. In a nutshell this stuff is great and really caught me off guard considering the price point. Not in the way that it smells expensive but in the fact that is VERY pleasant and appealing and this lasts 6-8 hours and while this doesn't project like a beast it WILL get you noticed and leave a nice silage trail.

After having this for only 2 days I've already received compliments on how nice this smelled and a few people have asked me what I'm wearing so they can buy this the self.(((Which says a lot right there )))

Like I said in my last review I said that this doesn't smell like a fragrance but more so like a tropical smelling shampoo or body wash.

After further testing I've had this last 6-8 with 2 hours of good projection but it still leaves a good scent trail for the duration of the fragrance.

Overall rating 8.5 out of 10 ! VERY impressed with the scent and performance but can't give it a 9 because I can't put it in the same category as my top 5 faves

CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,Should receive it monday or tuesday. What do you think of it compare to 2014 ?,07/10/16 08:13,DonSergio
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"The mojito lime zest only lasts a few minutes on the opening before it quickly settles into a creamy coconut scent with a hint of a green note- a bit like you have just bathed with the Body Shop's coconut shower gel. Definitely different from all the previous CK One Summer versions that were mostly fruity zesty/melon type affairs, apart from the 2010 version that was a very sharp bitter citrus smell that reminded me of an older gentleman's aftershave.
This 2016 version is certainly exotic and is probably what a paradise island smells like (though I've never been to one). The downside is lack of lasting power.",07/08/16 03:36,bassdemon

CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,This perfume is lovely and fresh and so light!! Can't stand strong perfumes in the hot weather it really is just too much - but this is light and airy.

CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"Refreshing, pleasant scent for summer. More for men than for women though. I like its top and middle notes very much, but base is very woody, so if you want to buy it, you should love cedar.",06/02/16 08:58,Arlene-Beatrix
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"Tested a spray on me at a department store.

Disclaimer: the tester bottle was different from the one pictured here. It was frosted translucent glass but did say CK One Summer and was at the same table as the green bottles. It _may_ have been a different one.

The one I tried smells like a marine-citrus shampoo. Pleasant and innofensive, but much less interesting, for me, than the original One.

Would wear it if offered (decent enough for discreet scents days), but would not buy it myself.",05/22/16 03:09,theuntrainednose
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"What woman wants to smell like an evergreen tree in the middle of summer?! To me, this fragrance fails on all fronts. I get no fruits, nothing but masculine heavy cedar. Not at all evocative of swaying palm trees.",04/25/16 09:01,OTA Mom
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"Who would have thought. I LIKE THAT!
I am no fan of ""summer editions"" of fragrances in general and I could never wear the original CK one.But!

This is refreshing with some exotic-sweet sensuality and intrigue. I absolutely LOVE the green-leafy bottle. Guava/tiare/apple, yes they are hidden somewhere in there.

Still, it's all about the opening. The drydown is mediocre and that's a usual problem with cheaper/commercial frags. Don't expect any complexity, don't expect ANY coconut. It turned too quickly to a masculine ginger-lime aftershave.

But my overall opinion is that this is one of the best Summer editions of CK One.",04/25/16 08:31,mypersonalharmonics
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"A really nice fragrance, what I would describe as a blend of crushed citrus fruits, crushed because somehow they don't have a definite freshness. It is very pleasant, better then the last few, but I would have to agree that sillage and longevity are very poor. A skin scent I will use after a Summer shower. I can't see any soapiness with this.",04/25/16 02:47,Coffee King

CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"A cottage into a tropical plantation.
Green leaf Chewing gum !

I love the bottle wich actually reprise the juice that is a sort of sugary fruity fresh green leaf smell. Must be this guava... Taste like ficus. Like cutted plants. Cucumber and figue.

It is very interesting, simple, warm orange and coco/tonka/vanillic notes also, plus the mentioned bitter and crude green notes.

What to say? It is a shame that us so weak.

Remember me in a far way La Perla Creation for that orange, and Armani eau de Cedre for that petrol taste. And un jardin sur le nil.",04/16/16 12:00,kl99
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"This is nice, but way too weak.
When you first spray you get the mojito,already faint, but within seconds it all turns into a skin scent. later i can recognize a very shy tiare flower. It pairs very well with the mojito, making this one more of a feminine than unisex perfume.At the end i get a bit of coconut but i really have to sniff my wrist to smell it.
I think this fragrance is great, very green, tropical and refreshing, but sillage is terrible.",04/14/16 10:23,raiza1990
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"What a fresh scent! On me it started off as a cool mojito enjoyed in the heat. The citruses were of course prominent from the first whiff. I also noticed an unpleasant tangy note, which I suspect is from the apple. Luckily it faded after a few minutes. As the scent developed on my skin, I noticed a sweet undertone peeping through slightly, which I believe is a mixture between the coconut and guava. I also pick up a cool almost aquatic note, which might be the minty freshness the mojito is famous for.

It´s a perfect summer scent, though I find it to be slightly too masculine for my taste!",04/11/16 08:52,MatheaR
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"The CK One summers are simple citrusy fresh scents with slight twists each year and great bottle designs. I've been collecting them since 2010 it's always nice start the summer with these frags, sometimes there hits (2013) and sometimes complete misses (2015). You can also find them really cheap if you shop around or online.

This years is a hit,but similar to 2014! Its a Fresh citrusy sweet floral scent- initial spray is fresh+citrusy ""mojito"" vibe, as it dries you get a more sweet+floral smell still with that underlying citrus smell at the end you get a soft citrusy soapy skin scent but keeping that ""mojito"" vibe.

This years bottle design is very nice miles better than last year it's palm trees with an embossed palm trees pattern on the back. Projection/longevity poor as usual 2 hours max. Overall 8/10 for this year's offering.",04/06/16 16:58,SDavis93
CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,If you really want the best of the best of the CK One Summer line the 2008 edition is by far the most awesome!

CK One Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"I agree with the review below. CK One Summer 2015 is the worst, following the second place is 2010. Really lack of character. 2014 is the best year for CK One Summer.",04/04/16 07:23,rickyfreaky13

I can smell the lime mojito the most, there is a slight lemon. I also smell the Juniper I think the notes mix well together. This perfume is a slight salty as well, but is more tolerable than CK2. This years CK One Summer is a must. Once it dries down I can start to smell the Moss, and Ceder coming through.",02/12/16 17:21,lizzyshreds

CK One Summer 2011 Calvin Klein,"Like many other CK One summer flankers, the theme is being citrusy fresh, with a bit of sweetness, reminding people of a refreshing summer drink.

I used to appreciate these annual releases with their different bottle colour design and little twist on the note. But of course, with more experience of different fragrances, these flankers or say, most Calvin Klein fragrances fall into the boring category unfortunately.

I remember back to 2011, when I first tried this, the mandarin note has a resemblance of CK Be. But this one is much fruitier than being herbal. There's a little white floral element as well.

Tried it again in the summer last year. Hate it! Still got the fruity mandarin opening, but soon it drys down to a really low quality powder. It smells sugary sticky at the same time. Maybe the bottle went bad I am not sure.

You wouldn't miss anything if you didn't try this.",09/01/17 06:02,GeorgeY

CK One Summer 2011 Calvin Klein,"I am in love with these Summer ones- pun intended! I am collecting what I still can pheasibly-I am not paying an arm and leg for the much older years. If I LOVE it, it will be bitter sweet anyway! First off I will say I have 2015-2011, this being the oldest one, but newest to me. I started collecting backwards, with 2014 being my first and very favorite year! It is the most feminine out of all the years I have. It's def 50/50-a truly unisex scent! It might even be too feminine for some fellas!! I don't know how feminine the years 2010-2005 were, but for unisex fragrances the rest are all a little more masculine about 60/40. The water, mint, watermelon, and cucumber notes (each have at least one) are what make them wearable for ladies. I LOVE them, but I have always loved wearing polo sport and other aquatic men's fragrances once in awhile anyway. If you love the smell of a man so much you wear those scents EVER, you'll love this line! If you love most citrus scents, you'll love this line as well. This particular scent is nice, very citrus and aquatic, but the kicker in this scent of me is the fern. It's def a more green scent that the others because of that! It makes this one unique, as well as the awesome bottle! The 2015-2013 bottles were all more similar in color schemes, so this one stands out for that reason as well! They are going quick, this is the oldest year I was able to get reasonably! eBay is still rocking them, so don't hesitate!",07/29/15 22:00,Jenyjane

Just like a ""summer scent"" should be, it's super fresh, I'm also inclined to say it's more masculine than feminine - however, longevity and projection is horrible. I tried lathering myself in it, but it still disappears after only a few moments.

CK One Summer 2011 Calvin Klein,"I will never understand these Perfume Company or Retail End Marketing practices...my only REAL perfume counter in my small town got this as a tester but NO stock for sale?!? Now, according to my ""best girl"", it is far too late in the season for us to get any summer flankers, at all! *sighs* The same thing happened with Le Male 2011, and Eternity Summer (men's and women's), so now they will all end up in some drawer, or in a dark back room at the store; and no one can buy this beauty...and a beauty it is!

I was a bit skeptical of the notes listed as they seemed like a ""mish-mash"" of earlier editions, and the flacon being tri-colored only added to my fears...but, lo and behold...this is gorgeous! It has ""citricity"" but is not overly biting or zesty (the tangerine and light lime are exquisite) and I do not get the melon (""calone"") so much, as a supremely satisfying fern note (like real lush ferns growing outside in the woods or in a cool wooded area). There is a slight sweetness, but nothing too sticky or saccharine. As it begins to evaporate, I get the freesia (somewhat warm and powdery floral) and the rhubarb blends seemlessly with the lush fern to make something just a bit different from all the other ck One summers, but still comfortably familiar. Warm subtle greens and and more of a ""marine"" breeze (rather than actual ""watery"" notes) swirl about and never ""crowd"" the central theme here. The drydown takes a nice cedar note, rubs it with musk adds a twist of soft fruitiness and tops it off with a dollop of incense smoke, intruiging and not oriental or dark, just enough. All in all, THIS summer flanker is (IMO) worth buying and considering the longevity (better than last years, by far) and that the price for a 100 ml EDT has only gone up two US dollars...this is a ""getter"" and a ""keeper"" for sure!!

Sillage: quite good
Longevity: very good
Overall: 4.25/5

This is still available on the companies web site (for now); and as soon as I can, I am SO getting one! I have a plethora of cK scents already and am usually am quite skeptical of seasonal flankers (also SPORT, ICE and EAU FRAICHE, etc...) but THIS has to be smelled and (if you are like moi) owned. It is at once FRESH, cool, bright and lushly green with just enough florals and vegetal notes to intruige but NOT smell just like everything else out there. I can almost swear I get a lotus or water lily note hanging around in the background. Yes...it is mass market; and YES it is summery, however it IS very nice!!",07/20/11 08:34,gypsy parfumista

CK One Summer 2011 Calvin Klein,"This CK One Summer is more like a Aromatic Fruity to me. It is like a fruity cocktail drink party here. I get a lot of melon, some tangerine, some tangy rhubarb, and sweet peach with a drop of zesty lemon. Then the scent gets slightly green (but not aquatic) and still stay fresh and fruity, but then it gets a tiny bit plasticky as well. I don't think I get an incense here or anything that is obviously woody. It can be easily worn by anybody.

For a summer scent, the staying power isn't all that great. Think of it as a vacation, it doesn't last but it's all good time while it does.

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"This is the best blended floral perfume i've smelled. It doesn't lean to far in any which way so while spring is obviously most appropriate I would go so far to say i'd reach for this all year round as long as the sun's out. Even if it's freezing outside and the leaves are crunching on the ground, if the sun decides to peak round for a bit of winter shine this perfume is still more than appropriate. This is bright and happy and friendly, imagine a golden retriever in a flower garden.",10/06/25 18:47,interstellarfairy
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I confess that normally Calvin Klein scents don't really last on me, so I haven't given them much attention. But Eternity Moment was a gift from a beautiful friend, and I knew I owed it to her to give it a try — and I am so glad I did. This is happiness in a bottle! Others are right to say it’s uplifting and makes you feel instantly happy — a real mood lifter. It smells pretty, and I feel pretty wearing it — a very feminine, clean, sparkly scent that lingers softly on the skin without ever being overpowering. It has that delicate balance of freshness and sweetness that makes it perfect for everyday wear, yet special enough for those moments when you want to feel effortlessly elegant. I have worn it everyday since I got it and am a bit sad that winter is on its way when I know I will start leaning towards warmer, snuggly scents...or will I? I know this is going to be a repeat buy for me!",10/01/25 11:37,London Lady

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Really beautiful floral scent, makes me happy when I smell it and was hoping to have it as an easy to reach for signature scent until I made the mistake of wearing it on one of the hottest summer days out in the sun and it turned indolic which threw me off 🥲. Still will keep it in my collection and try again once I’ve gotten over the shock haha. If you like floral, pink scents I would definitely recommend. I think spring and early summer might be best times to wear it.",08/21/25 16:25,MimiAD

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"With such a cult following, many of the Eternity flankers have thrived through the decades. This one particularly, although released over 20 years ago, doesn't feel dated. In fact, it's a composition we love and recognize today with it's floral lychee notes and an effervescent fruitiness. As oppose to the og Eternity which has more of a mature, almost vintage scent, this one is young, fresh, sweet and playful. It's an easy grab for Spring/Summer as it's inoffensive and leaves a soft but still perceived scent trail. It has good longevity and is just so uplifting to catch as you move around through the day.",08/01/25 16:54,Adenahi
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Eternity Moment and I had a bit of a love-hate relationship at first. There were moments I wasn’t sure about it… but somehow, it kept growing on me. And before I knew it, it became one of my most-used perfumes — especially on those days when I had no idea what to wear.

It’s effortless, feminine, and just works. Whether I’m running errands or heading out for a casual dinner, this scent always feels right. I used up my 100ml bottle with genuine joy — something that doesn’t happen often in my collection!

It might not be the most complex or niche, but there’s a comforting charm and reliability in it that I’ve truly come to appreciate.",07/31/25 05:15,Kamicee123

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I personally don’t detect any fruity notes in this scent, only floral ones. Perhaps I’m just sensitive to jasmine, which I’m not particularly amazed by, but all I can smell is jasmine with a hint of lily. It has a clean and fresh floral aroma. While it's not groundbreaking, I still like it, and my mom absolutely loves it; it suits her perfectly! There’s definitely something confident and feminine about this scent.",06/21/25 02:49,luna.lavandula

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Very pretty floral, it’s really hard to find something so realistic nowadays. And that’s why I think it’s unique and deserves attention, especially from those who love flowery scents (like me :)).
Except for the flowers, I can also smell fruity and woody accords, which make the composition more complex.
Performance is very good and price is really affordable. Definitely something worth testing. :)

Ps. I didn’t like the original much because it was cooler and had a weird unpleasant note that worked bad with my chemistry. It doesn’t show up in Moments so im really happy about it. I love this perfume :)",04/27/25 00:13,Punika
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I am always on the look for fruity scents so when I saw the melon and guava notes on this one I decided to give it a try. At first I didn't really love it, I wished the fruitiness was a little more present and I couldn't really pick out the guava that much. But after some time I found myself reaching for it more and more.
Now I actually like it, I can pick out a lot of the guava and melon on the first hour and it's a pleasant scent after it develops. You can pick it up as you move throughout the day. The only thing I'd change would be to tone down the musk a bit since it can be a little overpowering at first.",03/15/25 21:44,11p11111

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I got it from a friend who was flying in the winter 2025 and bought perfumes tax free.
I prayed on my wrist and rubbed my other wrist on it and I was totally overwhelmed by how STRONG and heavy it was. This was not a subtle scent as described. All I could smell was lots and lots of Jasmine and Lilly and it was so heavy I felt it was headache inducing. I don't smell any of the top notes at all. I only smell sticky heavy floral.

The time passed and after 1-2 hours I smelled it again with the same result. Jasmine and Lilly overload . It is not fresh and light. It is heavy and too much. An old lady perfume you pick up long before you actually is near the old lady who wears it. Maybe I got a bad batch? Maybe I have a super sensitive nose but I got a headache from this because it was so overpowering. I tried to wash it off but it stuck to my skin even if I used soap and warm water. I can't understand the other reviews at all. Gentle and light?!

I will ignore this bottle for a while and try in the spring again. When it is warmer outside. Maybe spray on my knee or something so it appears far away from my nose. If I get the same reaction then this will be my new toilet spray when the cat has used his litter box. Or I try to spray it inside my summer wardrobe far away from my bedroom. Maybe it will smell nice in 4 months. I can't even imagine spraying it and going to bed for a calmer sleep. This perfume is too LOUD!",02/12/25 14:51,Pumlake
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I was flying back home from an amazing holidays with my LDR partner who always wears CK ONE, and decided I needed a cappuccino. While looking for it at the menu, my eye got suddenly caught by a fragrance page, where I notice two CK presented. Really ,just out of nostalgia for my partners amazing smell ( because CK ONE is unisex and I could be as well wearing it myself , but I don't find it feminine enough so that wasn't an option for me), I gave myself in, and made a totally blind buy, just because we both like symbolical things and I thought it would be lovely to both have some casual CK on us, while apart..

Braved up to open it just the next day evening ( I'm not that lucky on blind buying the fragrances :D), I was so positively surprised, that this fragrance was really just the thing I was looking for for a quite some time.

Although the design of the bottle looks and feels a little cheap , the aroma itself was beautifully combined of the sweetness and a little fresh spark, that makes it just perfect for everyday use. It was strong enough to feel when entering the room, and it still lingers on my clothes hours after I have sprayed it, but not too overwhelming that it would become distressing. It is very simple, clean and what some would call generic, but I believe that's what makes it so universal and nice. I can sense white flowers in abundance, especially lily of the valley ( although it's not in the composition, strangely enough I can sense its delicate aroma there), and a jasmine.
Can't tell about the berries - as I was imagining more fruity opening, but I can't say it feels very present.

Overall, after the first notes had dried down, I realized there was something more and very dreamlike - the undertone I could remember from the fragrance my grandmom used to wear when she was still alive ( her favorite fragrance was from Oriflame and it was a little pink bottle with a new moon on it, titled ECLAT, and as far as I know they don't produce this aroma anymore)...and this sentiment, of course, blew my mind..

Eternity Moments are also my first perfumes I tried to use before I go to bed ( I read here, some of you tend to do that and decided to try, mm what a good idea, thank you) :) ...and they made me feel so soothed and relaxed, I was really surprised it works that way too.

Delicate but noticeable, very feminine, versatile for everyday use, and I would also say, despites it's generic nature it still has a hint of individuality, Eternity Moments is a pretty safe Blind buy for anyone who loves white flower compositions,( maybe not that perfect as a gift if you giving it to someone who appreciates the beauty and feeling of the bottle itself ), but the aroma itself is so satisfying, sentimental and dreamy, that the bottle didn't bother me after all.. Really simple and modest, but so satisfying aroma.",02/08/25 02:46,ilze.slinke

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Initially didn't like it at all. Still not a love for me. But i understand why people love it. This is a very Fresh floral fruity perfume and has watery or aquatic touch to it. Imagine blending or soaking huge amounts of different flowers with little fruits in water. The fruits are not sweet nor the flowers. Sometimes this perfume feels slightly bitter to my nose. I would love it if it was a tad bit sweeter. It is perfect for those who don't want sweetness and want something fresh and floral.
This is classy, feminine, can be worn anywhere, mostly in daytime, spring summer appropriate",11/02/24 23:02,Sadia_T
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"This perfume will forever be a love for me, I remember receiving a 100ml bottle years ago for a present when I was around 15 ,it became my signature scent I wore it nearly everyday up until I was around 20 maybe it was this and creed aventus for her they where my favourites . I’ve brought several bottles of this perfume lol and been gifted several.
This is a very fresh crisp floral with some fruity sweetness. Little watery too probably from the water lily.
oh I just love it it’s everything I love , very girly very pretty.
Easy to wear will get you many compliments this lasts for hours on my skin and clothes too.
So now that I’m 27 I still wear it lol till this day, I don’t wear it as often as I did but I do wear it i prefer to wear it in spring and beginning of autumn.
I’ve worn it in hot weather recently and it was beautiful but I just prefer to wear it when I said I do. When I did wear it couple days in hot weather it kinda took away that crisp freshness to it that’s the only reason why I don’t wear it that much in summer.",09/20/24 07:43,V_rose29
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"A subtle, comforting scent with slightly jarring additions of watery tropical fruits. These notes themselves are inoffensive, but clash harshly with the lighter white florals. The scent is somehow soapy without being clean, becoming much more musky and sweet woody once dried. Very intimate silage and underwhelming lasting power. Overall, a bit too juvenile for its intended market, even for a youthful warm weather scent.",09/01/24 03:42,LadyEmilyJones
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I chose Eternity Moment over a couple of other selections sampled in store and it won me over for my next floral fresh everyday spring time fragrance.
It’s not complex but that’s why I chose it, sometimes I just want a light scent to uplift me when I’m working from home or just enjoying a chill day off.
It has a fresh fruity opening with the florals coming through instantly, it then dries down into a musky skin scent. Not a strong projection or long lasting but for the price you can feel comfort in respraying often.",08/27/24 20:16,Amenti
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I have tested it in perfume store, This perfume Flory fresh with a little of sweetness, The most note I had smelled was the Pure Jasmine and white flowers. I think this is safe choise and acceptable to majorty of people, you can buy it blind buy.

لقد جربته في متجر العطور، هذا العطر منعش برائحة الزهور مع القليل من الحلاوة، وأكثر ما شممت رائحته كانت رائحة الياسمين النقي والزهور البيضاء. أعتقد أن هذا اختيار آمن ومقبول لدى أغلب الناس، يمكنك شراؤه شراء ً أعمى.

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Very pretty and aquatic fruity floral.
Opens with a fresh and lightly sweet litchi & raspberry before it settles into a fresh bouquet of peonies, jasmine, and waterlilies. Gets muskier as it dries down but the fresh and clean floral profile is still present.

It is very fresh and green, and, it also remind me of another of my beautiful perfumes; L'Eau d'Issey Florale by Issey Miyake, they are in fact sisters! And, they smell wonderful together!

I'm trying to leave a message at ""This perfume reminds me of.."", about these two sisters, but, it's sumting wrong with the side/Fragrantica, cause it doesnt work with neither of my machines.

Anyway, happy summer to all of you smelling good people out there!!!",07/09/24 02:27,Mona Lygre

A very feminine floral scent, pretty generic.
It smells nice... just nice, nothing more.
I wear it pretty often despite not absolutely loving it since I don't want to use my other more unique perfumes when I'm just running errands that day.
I'll be giving it away soon because I've grown tired of it. (used up 30% of the bottle)",06/21/24 02:05,everlyblossom

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Smells like a warm and sparkling rose bouquet. I can really smell the rose in this, even though it isn't a main note. Or could that be the peonies???

Reminds me of my youth as it was one of my first perfumes. 😊

I can kind of understand the 'generic' comments, but to me this is quite a memorable perfume, which is playful, romantic and mood-lifting.

Perfect for a job interview or first date as it's uncontroversial.

Has fairly good projection and staying power for the price.",05/21/24 10:35,Louise1984
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I hate it. I know it's all about out own PH anyway. I gave it a chance in different climates and temperatures and the result was the same.
It's unbearably strong on me, I can't stand using it, it gives me a headache.
It was a blind buy, I remember that as a child my aunt used it and it suited her very well.
While I had it I used it one summer to spray it into the garbage container.

The middle notes (floral) are too overpowering too much lily and jasmine, less rose and unfortunately the passion flower is not detected here. The top notes (fruity) are not felt at all, some sandalwood is rescued from the base notes.

If you like Jasmine and Lily this will be your cup of tea.",05/20/24 22:31,Lorevdv

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I much prefer moment to the OG eternity,
mainly because here we lose that slightly sickening sun cream note.

This is cheap and cheerful, potent, simple, playful, and very sweet.
Has some similar DNA to many floral street fragrances, but at a fraction of the price.

I don't get a whole lot of distinctive notes really, it's just a big cloud of floral/fruit.

VERDICT:
Definitely for teenage girls,
A bit basic, and I have no urge to buy a bottle -
But at it's price, it does a great job.",04/17/24 21:56,smelling.sniffing.swan

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I tested this in store today, and was strongly reminded of a scent I couldn’t pinpoint. After several hours of sniffing it suddenly hit me: it reminds me of 5th Avenue. While they have very different notes, one very prominent note is the same. This is quite a lovely fragrance if you’re into florals. It’s quite chic and elegant too. In the opening the Jasmin is quite prominent, which gives it depth and sets it apart it from 5th Avenue, the rose also separates them, but the vibe is extremely similar. In the dry down they’re almost the same, although I haven’t tried them side by side.
This is a lovely fragrance at a great price point. I do think 5th Avenue is just a tad more interesting, and if you already have one, you don’t need the other, unless you live this scent profile so much you want everything that smells similar with subtle differences.

This is an easy office friendly scent, that does make a safe blind buy if you enjoy floral scents. It won’t rock your world, but it’s a lovely go to scent for a sweet price.",11/29/23 07:43,Amber Plokchouli
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"By the notes listed I expected something more feminine but this is really sour and it’s no sweetness. It’s like sour soap, I love the soap part but that loud sour in the forefront really takes over and never leaves. I wonder which note that is so I can steer clear of buying fragrances with that note in it. It doesn’t subside either and it’s screechy. I like this scent and I just grin and bear it when I wear this cuz the soapy smell is really nice!— if only that gross sour part wasn’t there then this would’ve been a winner.",10/31/23 14:17,Gemsense

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"What a pleasant surprise this blind buy of Eternity Moment is for me. I just couldn’t resist the massive discount it was being sold for online, but I honestly didn’t expect that I would like it as much as I do.

There is something very bright, bubbly and refreshing about the opening for me that makes me think of champagne. I just got this delivered yesterday morning and wore it all day. sprayed some on again at night and it was the first scent I reached for this morning. It just knocked my Christian Dior Sakura mini obsession out of the way.

My teenage daughter said it reminds her of a mojito so I guess she is also feeling the bubbly refreshing notes like I am. I can’t even pick out the melon, guava notes because everything is so well blended together. The dry down notes work great on me. I can smell the sandalwood with some other woody notes nicely rounded on my skin. I have zero complains about the sillage and longevity being moderate because I only paid $10 for a 100ml bottle.

It brings back some youthful, happy feeling for me so I am very satisfied with it and I will purchase it again if I find it at a bargain price, so my daughter can have one for herself too. I much prefer it to the original Eternity.",07/25/23 01:13,MadameMerola

This is strong to begin and really makes me think of the cold / hot play off of the elements in the original eternity. Overall this is a fresh feeling, slightly watery, slightly sappy floral. The waterlily to me is the thing that I think gives it that feel. It's also quite musky and linear and a little woody. This one isn't special for me, it just makes me think of shampoo really. It's a clean soap like watery floral version of eternity.",07/15/23 06:52,qofb

It dries down very fruity in my opinion. Very feminine and soft, he likes it on me and I don't hate it (coming from someone who hates floral notes) so I think it's a win.

If you want a simple soft scent with a hint of fruitiness wrapped in a soft warm fuzzy blanket. You will definitely like this fragrance.",11/20/22 07:43,NadaKimari
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"blind buying this because the review and the notes looks promising. it is not. smells very cheap and artificial. i don't really smell the litchi, but the raspberry and musk notes were strong. the dry down smells like cardboard on my skin 😣😣😣 maybe it just doesn't go well with my body's chemistry.",11/10/22 06:35,izzatul
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,Smells like sitting in a a bubble bath as a kid with shampoo in your hair that smells fruity. Youre playing mix and match of all the gels and shampoos within your arms reach and having a blast of fresh and sweet smells in your nose.,10/31/22 09:48,htedohreci
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I bought this as a blind buy because it was a great price, and you usually can't go wrong with a CK fragrance.

Unfortunately, I forgot why I didn't like Eternity in the 90's and this flanker I am getting the same experience. For some reason, the opening top notes are so screechy and astringent that does not go away for most of the wear. I get this when fragrances are too aquatic or fresh, like Cool Water, where it just hits me right at the nostrils.

Due to this, I am not able to really catch the nuances of the notes. I'll try again during hot weather and see how this goes.",10/26/22 09:06,BougieGirlShops
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Peony, jasmine, and litchi are the most stand out here. Other fruity notes make this perfume cheerful, and the woodsy notes in the list are the settler that prevent this to become too aquatic.

I love EM for its simplicity and how transparent and airy this one is. It smells so pleasant, far from complex. This is one of the perfumes that I would reach for when my mood is good and I have a peaceful mind.",10/16/22 03:03,dualaokto
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,Perfume has a special memory attached to it and also it has my favorite note which is fruity lychee. It is perfect for summer and Early mornings. Definitely going to buy it again. It was really affordable price at Marshall’s,10/06/22 21:54,sravz
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"This was one of my very first perfumes, probably when I was just a young teen, got it from my mom. She wore/wears it too - we both always has one bottle in hour collection - for almost 20 years now.. It's just such a great, every day perfume, not offensive, classic in my opinion. I will always have bottle of this, along with CK one, kicking around on my shelf.",10/02/22 11:36,laurasoeborg

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"This was a blind buy for me from Ross a while back. At first I didn’t really like it because it was too… I don’t know, kind of grapefruit-y? I have a hard time describing perfumes lol.

So I put it in Facebook marketplace to sell and it has sat in the trunk of my car for a couple months with no hits on Facebook. Well every time I opened my trunk something smelled really good. Not sure if it was this or a Bath and Body Works lotion that I have in there somewhere.

Well I decided to give this scent another chance and I love it now! Very floral and kind of powdery, a little fruity but not too much. Definitely has good sillage and can be smelled coming off my neck and wrists. I’m definitely going to need more of this scent! Luckily I see it at Ross a lot.",09/03/22 18:13,fairydust1025
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I had to review this perfume in case anyone saw that it was compared to Gucci Envy Me on here and believed that! It definitely doesn't smell like that and I remember that one well. The only similarities are probably the first initial burst of freshness with this one. Nonetheless, I was disappointed with this! It's super screechy and head-ache inducing floral. All I smell is sharp and loud lily. It's strong and not in a good way. I actually love florals and those are my favorite notes in a perfume but this one is simply too overwhelming. I made the mistake of spraying it multiple times on my neck and felt nauseated for a while. I do think it smells summery and fresh in its own way but there are way better perfumes out there that aren't so damn screechy. Beware !",08/11/22 13:10,RetroPickle
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"This is such an interesting scent! Our live-in nanny used to wear Eternity all the time, and I’d compliment her each time. Because I was so intrigued, I got Eternity Moment. While I loved the smell, I wouldn’t reach for it as much, don’t ask me why. It’s a gorgeous sparkling fruity floral. I get the sweetness, probably from the litchi, and the melon and raspberry. It’s almost effervescent. However, after months of having it and not reaching for it, I gave it to my nanny.

Oh. My. God. I realised I loved smelling it on her. I think it’s got to do with how well the perfume projects. It’s a room filler for sure, although I do notice that the smell is gone fairly quickly. But when I can smell it, it is truly gorgeous. I think this is one of the perfumes that needs to be appreciated from the distance. Whatever it is, I am glad I get to smell this one.",08/05/22 06:15,ssamhita
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"My 2nd favorite floral perfume after marc jacobs daisy eau so fresh. It's so refreshing, light, and feminine. Makes me feel surrounded with flowers.",07/20/22 12:33,bloominghale
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I blind bought this after seeing it reviewed by some youtubers I trust. At first spray on the cardboard box all I got was jasmine and musk, like jlo glow but sweeter. I was pretty disappointed bc that scent profile gets to me after a while. But when I sprayed it on my wrist it was totally different. It started with the litchi and raspberry with that jas/musk profile very light behind it. On the dry down it is totally melon, 90s melon, reminds me a lot of ck escape type of melon. It generally feels very fresh and green. This makes me think of being outside, a great one for being out in nature on warm days. I will definately wear this, but likely wont repurchase.",06/30/22 07:31,Red Jaguar
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Someone gifted me Eternity Moment by Calvin Klein as a Christmas present. When I sprayed it on a piece of paper, it smelled decent & generic. But when I sprayed it on my skin, it literally smelled like a cat litter box or some animal. I believe it was the base note of musk in it that was unbearable for me. It didn’t mix well with my body chemistry at all. I desperately wanted to wash it off my skin after spraying it. It instantly made me nauseous and I wanted to gag. My mother loves this fragrance (I don’t know why) so I gave it to her.",06/22/22 15:39,jessyylovesglam
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,I have to say I don’t love this perfume. It’s not bad but it’s not good or memorable. It definitely has a fresh kind of smell to it but in a very generic kind of way. I use it as a air freshener for my bathroom,05/31/22 00:13,Lolly_pop123

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Generic fruity floral, smells like a cheap drugstore perfume. Really simple fragrance, no character. Might be a nice gift for a young girl, otherwise not worth it.",03/23/22 14:57,AlexaScent
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"This might be generic or boring to some. But I find it perfect for out of the shower or when going for a walk/hiking (yes, I wear perfume when hiking lol). Mixes well with sweat or damp skin without getting nasty. It also mixes well with nature? If you get what I mean. Blends well without ""taking away"" the experience of a mountain hike or being too intrusive.
It's fresh, clean and soapy, quite shower gel like. Has a wateriness. I think one wouldn't enjoy it if you dislike squeaky clean scents. Definitely predominately floral, however I also get a pear vibe, even though pear is not listed? This is very fresh compared to fruit-choulis, but doesn't have the citrusy aspect very many ""freshies"" have.
Not very unique but it does the job without breaking the bank!",03/19/22 17:33,Siljemariyeah

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"It was my first blind buy and initially I was very satisfied with it. 🌸 It's a day time fragrance which, while being floral and delicate, is not overly sweet. As it develops and the head notes fade away, the woody notes kick in. I'm not as happy with it as in the beginning, it seems a little too banale and simple, like an air freshener. Not my vibe anymore",02/13/22 00:45,Szafirowy czar
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Another blind buy 🙈
I must admit that I was pretty scared, some of the reviews make it seem like this scent is horrible.
Thanks to YT, I took my chances - what a win for the price.
I like it a lot, clean, fresh a tad bit sweet, perfect for spring and walks.
If you like floral(think pink) you'll like this one
How can anyone hate this is beyond me🙁
It does have a similar vibe to Versace bright crystal - EDT
This is a 'dumb' reach really",01/24/22 04:00,Kuty22

To me, it smells like an annoying person, even tho one of my coworkers uses it, on her its fine but I still think it doesn't suit her. IDK?! Never has such a reaction from a fragrance 😕
Anyway, it smells cheap sharp childish.
Reminds me of a floor cleaner my grandmother used when I was a child, straight lilly of the valley, artificial.
Just got a headache from smelling it now, bleah.
My partner is not a fan either",11/25/21 10:09,sandradiana

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I tried in store, I thought it was overbearing and synthetic at first, but after a couple of hours it's just lovely. The sillage is not very good, though. If it was stronger I'd buy a bottle as it's always on offer...but I can't be bothered to respray all the time.",10/28/21 10:39,Lo87
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,This smells way better in cooler fall weather.,10/20/21 02:35,Gemsense
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I have to say, I really wasn’t expecting to love this one as much as I do. I own both the original Eternity and Eternity Now. I love them both so I didn’t think I needed this one. I was shopping in Marshall’s one day when I saw a few one ounce bottles and thought what the hell? I was also surprised to see this one period because I thought it had been discontinued years ago. I spritzed it on and thought basically what everyone else is saying here which is hmmmm, nice! Pretty generic and basic but nice! After an hour went by though, I started getting whiffs of this deeply rosy, woody sensual scent. Like the original, this one definitely needs time to develop.

I have plenty of soapy, fresh out of the shower scents. And yes, I am partial to that. I guess I am a pretty basic bish and a one trick pony when it comes to perfume. I love stuff that smells naturally like what lingers after a hot shower or what just subtly adds to the clean smell of my skin, hair or clothes. Eternity Moment is that and it does simple very well. It’s sort of hard to describe but it has the same vibe as Cerutti 1881 which I am obsessed with. I am not saying that they smell exactly alike but they both make me feel really clean, ladylike and put together. If you mixed Cerruti with J Lo’s Miami Glow and added a little bit of Britney’s Believe that might come close to describing Eternity Moment. If you like any of those perfumes, you would probably really enjoy it. I have recently discovered that I love the rosewood note in most fragrances and it’s prevalent in this one. I was afraid that the melon note was going to be too strong but I can barely detect it. Thank God because for me, melon just goes acrid on my skin. The raspberry, passion flower, guava, peony, cashmere and musk blend so well and create that sexy ‘your freshly washed skin but a little better’ effect that I like so much. This is different from the original Eternity and Eternity Now. EM would be like the romantic, girlier flanker of the three to me. I don’t feel unisex here, this is straight up femme. Eternity Now would be like the summer version or eau fraiche version of Eternity. I don’t think EM and EN smell alike. All three are beautiful in different ways but I think EM is my favorite right now. There’s just something special here that was a nice surprise.

The bottle that I bought in store was pretty good but it didn’t perform the way that I wanted it to. Maybe all the bottles circulating the discount shops are watered down because the reviews on here were saying that the longevity/sillage were really good when it first came out. I think there’s something to that because I managed to get an older bottle. Older formulations are made in the U.S., the juice is a darker gold and the stickers on the bottom are metallic. Comparatively, the newer bottles are made in France, the juice is a paler pink/gold and the stickers are clear. I thought my older bottle had turned at first because it smelled a little smoky and stale. After a half hour went by, it became that amazingly clean scent only deeper and longer lasting. It lasts past six hours and the sillage was in fact perfect. It’s not heady or suffocating but I could smell it as I moved around at work. Someone described wearing this after a hot shower with a cup of tea and a book. Maybe a Yankee candle is lit up nearby, the windows are open, and you can start to feel the breeze that’s tickling the curtains. The pitter-patter of rain commences as you snuggle into your favorite blanket. I think that perfectly encapsulates the vibe. Cozy, cottagecore, N-I-C-E ness. I feel like this can be worn in all seasons. It’s so subtle that I don’t think the weather really impacts performance but that’s just on my skin. I loved it in summer and now it’s transitioning nicely into fall.

This IS really similar to Oscar de la Renta’s Flor. After falling so hard for EM, I had to try it. Flor is the green sister while Eternity Moment is the fruity-woody sister. Both are stunning! Flor doesn’t last as long but the sillage is a little better. I guess fragrances like these are getting phased out right now but they feel pretty classic. In my humble opinion, these are both cheap, well-made, good performing fragrances. Try them if you’re into the freshies.",10/07/21 15:50,DieT CroaK
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I was gifted a full bottle by a friend and I just never liked it. Every time I've put it on, it gives me a headache/makes me gag. Too bad, because I don't think I'm one of those people who can't stand florals. (Red Door is one of my all-time-faves) And the Eternity for Men is a BIG favourite with both my husband and I. Strange. Wish I could pinpoint the exact note that doesn't agree with me, but alas. One of the few unused, can't-stand-it perfumes I (unfortunately) own.",09/18/21 03:00,sapphira4
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Very flowery and fresh. Moderate sillage and longevity. It's a great spring/summer scent, great for a little casual luxury.

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Very very light version of Oscar de la rentas flor
Its meh to me. Its way too light. If it just had a deeper musk and a dominant note to ride on the musk, then it would be fine. It is summer time so this may be better in different weathers, we shall see 😚 otherwise it's pleasant but just too safe for my personality, too quiet and subdued. Ill also try using this as a layer top fragrance maybe just layer it with flor for added power, although flor is strong just how i like it😉. You know, i cant stand sugary scents, but i own tons of them. The sugar juices are all missing something floral, so i think ill try adding this to finish off my sugar bombs. It just might work!",07/15/21 18:00,Gemsense

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Wow I finally found a Calvin Klein perfume that I really like during the entire wear. It started for me with a burst of yummy fruity scents with the melon leading the way, which quickly develops into a lovely floral bouquet of delightful scents. I really notice the lily, jasmine and rose notes which make a beautiful scent.

Moment gives off a big enticing scent that lasted on me all day and I could softly smell it in the morning. Oh yes the dry down was a very nice light musk cashmere woody scent that was just alluring, husband verified. I would repurchase this perfume for it works great in this cold weather right now and can see using in honestly all year around.

A safe blind buy for floral lovers with hints with fruit, touch of musk with the florals leading 90% of the way. Good for day and night use, jeans or dresses .",03/15/21 21:53,carlahoffman
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I'm wearing this today, and I'm really liking it. On me, this fragrance starts very alcoholic, but after 10 minutes it becomes an intense floral/berry blend. As it settled, I detected clearly raspberry, rose and jasmine.
The drydown on my skin is soapy and flowery, with hints of warm sandalwood.

Performance-wise, it lasts about 4-5 hours and the sillage is moderate. I had to refresh it during the day, other than that imho is office friendly.",02/23/21 12:20,LeAx
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Is it only me feels it similar to Versace bright crystal one? I find this one even more complex and better performer.

It’s not groundbreaking, it’s something I would love to use everyday.
Nice for a casual day, formal situations, quite versatile.",02/17/21 08:15,Kathgolap88
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"This is a true beauty. It's a perfect blend of florals with fruits. I smell mainly peony and melon with something very soapy (maybe the water lily and musk). It's a very clean and feminine perfume, and very easy to wear. Starts out strong but then it sets down to a more mellow and flowery scent. Perfect for spring and summer.

It's one of those perfumes that I like to wear for uplifting my mood.",01/29/21 07:42,sweryn
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"A beautiful, inoffensive floral, with a tad of sweetness from the fruit, and softness from the musk and cashmere.
I don't usually make declarations on other people's perfumes, but I have to say that this is the type of fragrance every woman should have in their collections. It's great for young women's first real perfume, grown women's feelgood scent and the more androgynous women's (like me) flower shop fragrance.
I love this.",01/19/21 22:30,Juttajii
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"This is one of the fragrance that i bring with me on my vacation in Africa.

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I LOVE this scent, it’s perfect. But why does my brand new sealed bottle last literally only an hour even sprayed on clothes?! Is anyone else’s this weak too?? I want to find an exact dupe that smells identical but with amazing lasting & projection power, I don’t care if it’s expensive.

Edit, 1/21/21:
So I just received my bottle of Oscar de la Renta Flor, yes, it smells EXACTLY like this! Projection power is really nice on this one, still testing the longevity :)",01/13/21 19:40,Balletflowers
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I like this one, it smells more expensive than it is, and reminds me of Lys Mediteranee by Frederic Malle (which is wonderful, but £150 for 50ml, whereas you can find EM for £20 in the right High St shops or online). To me it mainly smells of lilies, which I love. I like it layered with Bvlgari Goldea in winter.
Very nice, and if you love Lys Mediteranee but can't stump up £150 at the moment, this is well worth a try!",12/09/20 01:47,Zethre

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I read a lot of reviews before blind buying this fragrance and a lot said it was for a younger audience however when I originally smelt it it reminded me a lot of something my gran might wear. It’s super floral, expectedly so with little sweetness (in my opinion) and a little bit powdery. I sprayed this once in my room and for the next 3 days you could smell it all over the house so the longevity is incredible. And I can say that the more I smell this the more I like it!

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"so far my fav from CK, cheapie price but expensive smell",10/02/20 21:26,gillbert
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Reedited my previous review, as I think it didn't do this one justice. This is a wonderful scent, sweet, floral, clean yet so alluring that it's a pity people don't praise it for what it is. Very loved in Europe, especially on European YouTube channels (Italian mostly).

For the reviewers who mentioned this is 'green' - I simply get the exact opposite. To me, this perfume has absolutely nothing to do with D&G Light Blue, freshness, greeneries or anything of the sort- quite contrary.

It's sweet but light, not cloying, not spicy or patchouli-ish at all. Some people smell 'green' and 'citrusy' fresh, to me there is nothing of the sort in this. Just sweet flowers, very potent and possibly 'intoxicating' had this not been so beautifully balanced. A sexy vixen perfume, but for one who loves summer dresses and white satin gloves. Conjures up feelings of 'girlfriend', 'wife', 'adoration', 'love' ... I'd wear this as a bride or bridesmaid :)

Eternity Moment has the same base as Eternity with a lot of floral elements and a 'honey' on top. It's something sweet, but I can't tell where it comes from.
I am not good at naming notes and that is also confusing to me, but I can describe it as if you imagine you're sniffing Eternity, with tuberose on top and about 10%-15%, if not 20, of JPG Scandal (the warm honey core). It's beautifully balanced as in you can immediately feel it as sweet, but can't detect sugar or patchouli. Honey as in a honeyed echo, not the scent itself.

I also feel a fat, juicy and gooey peony, sweetened lily of the valley and lotus, surprisingly they aren't listed in the notes, but melon is. I can't feel that one.

This is flowery but sweet and sexy, I could say this might even belong in the same category as Si and the likes. However it does not smell of incense, it does not smell 'fresh' like laundry, it is not generic like Miss Dior and Coco Mademoiselle, or sweet like Britney Spears/ Paris Hilton, or whatever other fragrance du jour people like wearing.

It is quite a unique, a very feminine and elegant scent, one that's also surprisingly very expensive-smelling for its price tag (100 ml/ 3.3 fl OZ for 20 eur in Belgium).
To me it is very similar to 5th Avenue, but much sweeter, and has almost 0 citrusy notes from the orange blossom flower.

Potent but not cloying at all, it can be worn successfully at the office, on an outing with friends, if you prefer, even if it's glamorous. Again, it's sweet but not heavy or candy-like. To me, it smells completely different from let's say Elie Saab, but has the same exact vibe- a heavy, thick and creamy satin veil, bridal and attractive, sweet and love-seductive, as opposed to 'attraction'. Really, really love this one. Will continue repurchasing to no end, it's my most favourite flowery perfume that has dethroned my 5th Avenue that I've been wearing for 15 years now. Absolutely adorable.",09/16/20 08:53,JolieSucre
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"This one is a winner for me. I love it. It is a particularly strong perfume. When I spray one spray, I get different notes than if I spray 3 sprays. With 3 sprays, I get almost a soapy vibe which I usually detest. After about half an hour, that fades. There's a burst of white sugar in the opening. It comes across as a strong floral fruity perfume with woods and resins.

Upfront, there's lychee, guava (nice not at all sour), peony and passion flower.

The reason why I've picked passion flower, is because this perfume is like Guerlain Aqua Allegoria Passiflora's older and wiser sister. The Mom, was Calvin Klein Truth. The Dad, was Eternity original. They gave birth to fruity, ozonic children.

A bargain fragrance. I only smell about 20% of Eternity original's DNA in this. I feel like this is a safe blind buy as a gift. Happiness in a bottle.

I really, really like the long, elegant shaped bottle too. Unfortunately, I had to buy 50mls because, like the traditional shaped bottle, the 100mls is too tall for my drawer.",09/15/20 00:47,AnaisLouLou
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"This smells like a toned down Gucci Bloom (the original). A soft, powdery floral. I do not get much of the sweetness from the fruity notes, but more so the florals. The peony is very strong, which helps the rose not be too overpowering. I like that they used lighter wood notes at the base, so it doesn’t have that aftershave-type pungency perfumes can take on when they overdo it. This is a light, airy fragrance safe for everyday wear. I was kind of hoping for something that would project more, but as stated, I do have other fragrances that smell similar to this. I guess the main drawback is that this doesn’t smell very unique.",08/28/20 16:29,SeauxGood
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"A fresh, greenish scent with white flowers. Reminds me of lily of the valley's scent. My mother loves this and I like it on her, but not on myself.

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I loved Eternity back in the 90s. This version upon first spray is quite alcoholic but give it 10 minutes and you are left with a beautiful rose delight. I think this fragrance would make a perfect wedding scent as it is light, fresh and flowery. Nothing groundbreaking but then sometimes perfume doesn’t need to be that, it just needs to be nice and this is really nice. A good blind buy if you like soapy, sweet perfumes.",03/10/20 03:40,hellofawoman
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I'm a fan of CK's Eternity line, especially the original EdP and Eternity Air, Eternity Moment is in my view just as good as the original and Air.

I'm surprised to see that Eternity Moment is from 2004; I genuinely thought it was a more recent release but that said, it does have the typical ""shower fresh"" facets that most fragrances of the early 2000's have.

I always feel that the original Eternity (and Air for that matter) is perfectly suited to the warmer months as it has a very cold, metallic, ozonic and green freshness to it, Eternity Moment is equally suited to the warmer months, daily casual wear and for the office. Unlike most shower gel type scents, Eternity moment does have quite good lasting power and a nice moderate silage, it will last from 8am till 5pm quite well and is strong enough to get some compliments but not enough that it will fumigate a room.

Notes! Eternity Moment is predominantly on me a mild fruity aquatic floral, the DNA hints to L'eau D'issey by Issey Miyake. I mainly pull from it melon, guava, waterlily and musk, I cant detect any cashmeran notes or any of the woodsy notes, its just a fresh and clean scent thats very easy to wear.

Would I repurchase? Once my 100ml bottle runs out, I would quite happily reconsider buying again, its a versatile scent and makes a great easy reach scent, its also available at some pretty good prices too!",02/10/20 06:10,GinCatsBooks
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"The opening is a bit alcoholic, but it turns fast into a fresh and feminine floral. Delicate and pretty. After that it turns into a powdery bar of soap. I don’t really like this stage.
Overall it’s a nice fragrance. Nothing groundbreaking but it is pleasant. A bit more jasmine wouldn’t have hurt though.
Final note: 6/10",02/08/20 08:33,raiza1990
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I was overwhelmed by the initial sweetness, good thing is it settles down in abut an hour or so. Had to wait until the dry down to understand why this perfume is in Eternity family. Absolutely gorgeous, all-year-round imo, would love to see how it develops in warmer weather, (it is currently winter at my end). Extremely well blended. Mood lifter. Happy scent. Ideal for office as it is not cloying.",01/25/20 02:58,kati19bo
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Beautiful rose and peony. One second I smell rose (dog rose Rosa canina), another peony.

There is a chemical note in the background (plimsolls rubber and ballpen ink). But peonies' fragrance also does have a chemical note to it (to me peonies smell like roses with freshness of lily-of-the-valley and discrete note of hair lightening cream (sniffing deeper) sometimes as strong as horseradish or crushed papaya seeds. Peony without this fresh harsh note is just rose.

The perfume reminds me Pivoine by Yves Rocher, but two times stronger.",12/05/19 12:55,justfloral
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"You know those candies that are like ""Sweet...and then sour."" This reminds me of those because it's basically two different scents in one.

It's floral first. A bursting fresh floral type of scent at first. Very pretty and clean. Lasts a moderate 5 hours total but those last 2 hours it's a skin scent. At that point...it's still on you but when you stick your nose to your arm to smell it...it's just the fruit notes left over. And it's pretty until the very end.

Anyway...this isn't anything incredibly remarkable. However...it's very clean and versatile. One of the first words that comes to mind when I smell this is ""friendly."" It's a SUPER friendly, pretty perfume that has a lot of versatility in terms of age. I can see a 15 year old wearing this as well as a 40 year old.

But yes. It's floral. Then fruity. NOT a linear perfume. Changes a lot from initial spray to skin-scent dry down.

Longevity - 5 hours total projecting well for about 3-3.5 hours.

Projection - About 3 feet. Spray your neck, arms, AND shirt to give it some extra strength.

Overall Score - Somewhere between a 7.5 & 8 out of 10.

This one is definitely a pleasant scent. And one I would consider a safe blind-buy. Thumbs up Calvin Klein. I personally really enjoy your fragrances and think that the line as a whole is much too overlooked and criticized.",11/26/19 09:18,Mdox407
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Sweet and delicious, but it has something sharp that makes it a bit shower gel-like. Feminine and youthful. If it weren't for that sharp note, it would be 10 times more expensive-smelling and beautiful.",06/20/19 05:43,food.is_life

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Bought this last week after reading the reviews.
First spray.........urgh what what I thinking?!!!!! Didn’t have time to wash it off before going out. 30 minutes later......what is that gorgeous smell? That’s right, EM is absolutely beautiful!!!! Lovely feminine floral. I had only bought the 50ml and am going through it soooo quick I’ve just ordered 100ml as back up. My new favourite fragrance! ❤️",02/17/19 04:51,Gem12
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Nice, unassuming fruity-floral, more floral on me actually. I really like CK fragrances, I have a good relationship with them. This was another blind buy and it is a safe one. It's young and fresh but it can get a bit cloying on very hot weather I imagine. To my nose, the drydown is quite close to Tracy by Ellen Tracy, minus the creaminess of the latter. A good buy for a very good price.",08/27/18 10:50,colibri_classique
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"A light, clean, and fruity floral. Sadly a little generic too. Eternity Moment is a suitable office scent. It lacks citrus, amber, vanilla, patchouli, and other staple notes among popular fragrances. This lends itself to a lighter, unobtrusive atmosphere, but it never leaves body-spray territory. I wish the woods came through more or that there was an additional note to add variety, like moss. For these reasons, it doesn't justify the price or strong pursuit.",07/31/18 09:39,EnergeticCrab
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,I was given a 100 ml bottle of this a couple of weeks ago. It's a fruity floral that can be worn and not bother anyone. The longevity and sillage are quite measly despite it being an edp. This is a very popular workplace fragrance in my country that is nearly always discounted so I am eager to use it up and move on.,06/30/18 20:38,Clare101
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Eternity Moment - this was a blind buy for me and my first CK perfume lucky enough, to be able to add to my collection. I love this scent. Its all “Floral”. At first spray I pick up litchi, pomegranate blossom, water lily and Jasmin.
I love this sooo much, that I'm now on my second bottle. Eternity Moment does not disappoint!",06/19/18 21:41,tinkerbelllx
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"A fresh cut flower smell, very fresh and clean, perfect for day wear. Could be worn at work as it's inoffensive. Pretty and feminine.",04/13/18 13:22,olliejosh32
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"This is lighter than what I usually go for but there's something about it I find intriguing. Maybe it's the passionflower in there which I always really enjoy. And I do like the peony which is not too overpowering maybe because it's getting along nicely with the litchee fruit. It's just lovely, and though its light, I enjoy spraying every few hours just to get those first fresh wafts of this beauty.

After this horrible endless snow filled overly cold winter, a bit of spring is happening today, and Eternity Moment fits the bill perfectly for me right at this ""moment""! Gals at my dentist's office complimented me on this, said it was so nice.

Edit: 3 weeks later - I have finished my 50 ml. bottle and have since heard this was discontinued. No! So I hurried up and ordered a 100 ml bottle which I just received. It smells a lot fresher and stronger than the 50 ml I finished up. Probably the drugstore where I got that had it hanging around a long time. Thinking to maybe hoard a few more, I love this.",03/13/18 13:20,juniemoon
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Very light fragrance. It's not overbearing or invasive, just simple and elegant. The kind you'd wear to work or something you don't want to announce your awesomeness.

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Believe it or not, I found an almost full bottle of this on the foreshore of the River Thames in London.

Being a perfume addict, I picked it up. Unfortunately I don't actually like it, so I use it to spray it around the house and bathroom as air freshener. I think they tried to add a muskiness to it that just doesn't jive with the fresh top notes.. then again I am no expert. But there is something in it that definitely puts me off. I guess someone felt the same way when they tossed it into the river! :D",02/04/18 09:12,missviv
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Personally I adore the smell of flowers, and this one is soo flowery.
At first it's a strong mix of flowers, makes me think of daisy's actually (even though it's not in there), then the water lily becomes very apparent, and it settles into a melon floral scent.the melon is very light though.
I adore this perfume, on my skin flower smells work so well. If you have trouble with florals then this is probably a pass for you or at least test it first. The first calvin klein perfume I tried years ago, I was like twelve, and from then on its been one of my absolute faves.
It's lively, and elegant, and happy, all at once.
I never tried the original, but I intend to so I can have a basis of comparison for the two.",02/03/18 16:17,Tealer
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Another ""sale"" purchase, bought blind entirely based on the reviews I read on here but I was pretty certain it would be a safe everyday kind of fragrance.

It is lovely; fruity and floral with some soft, woodsy element. Out of the box it reminds me of Next Just Pink which I wore in my very early 20s and loved for its zesty uplifting qualities. Eternity moment has the same kind of effect - it's not sexy or alluring or complex but a couple of spritzes of this perfume will instantly lift spirits and induce happy feelings.",12/28/17 11:09,paulinebrown36
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I am wearing this fragrance right now. I actually used a lot of Eternity before, this is the first day I am using Eternity Moment and it is just very nice. It is not too cold out there so I believe the smell is not too empowering but it has a strong element of water lily and pink peony to it that makes it very special. One thing that I found fascinating was the woody notes after you leave it on your skin for some time. And I love it. Its like the fresh air you smell after the first rain.",12/14/17 02:18,primrose_in_spiderland
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,This works best on me in the hot weather. In cold weather it smells sharp and sour. Doesnt last all day on me i have touch up after a few hours. Lovely colour bottle. I like both eternity's but in winter original eternity smells like this on me. Very strange. I am on my second large bottle of this and will repurchase its perfect for any occasion not too much of anything but that same trait i find positive makes this boring and un eventful for other people. Cant please everyone I guess.,11/14/17 18:22,takeasniff
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Agree w many reviews that it's nice n on me it is especially nice! Settles in smoothly w no sharp edges which i luv! 1st bottle 2017 n imagine it will not be my last.

Note- remnds me of Paris YSL",10/22/17 19:31,m_mtz40
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I was looking for a summer perfume that leaned more towards the floral fruity or floral aquatic family and this was amongst my choices along with D&G Imperatrice and Eternity NoW which I both know and adore but I decided to opt for this one for several reasons amongst whom the fact that is highly probable that is discontinued, the price/quantity ratio (I bought 100ml for 30 euros) and last but not least the excitement of a blind buy. I know that blind buys are always risky but for now I love taking risks at perfumes.

So, I had no idea what this perfume would smell like not even looking at the notes. I was hoping for a floral fruity aquatic with prominent fruity aquatic notes, but it was not the case with this perfume. Not that I hate it but it was simply not what I was looking for. It's a nice and generic floral but nothing special or groundbreaking. I would dare say that sometimes I find it boring.
First spray and it reminded me of another perfume I have already had and enjoyed: of course the classy EA 5 Avenue, the floral vibe is almost like EA but the difference is that EA stays floral all the way while this one has an inconfondable fruity vibe given by litchi and the leading floral note is peony. Also the fruity part I find it similar to Versace Bright Crystal only that BC is more girlish and watery while EM is more adult. I think if 5 Avenue and Bright Crystal blended together the result would be Eternity Moment. To me during the first 5 minutes this perfume is a typical floral but then the fruity notes start to appear especially litchi and raspberry even though the never fully take the stage. In the drydown becomes a creamy floral so not fresh or aquatic.

The fragrance screams spring to me; the blossom of the flowers and how they fill the air with their perfume in the early morning. It's like walking barefoot in the middle of a garden and inhaling the perfume of peonies, jasmin, water lilly. This perfume started to grow in me, there's something mature and classy about it, it's easywearing but it requires a character. I also believe it makes a statement for whoever wears it but I think it especially suits women above 30.

And by the way I loved the publicity of this fragrance back when it was released. Everytime it would air on TV I would leave whatever I was doing and go watch the beautiful Scarlett Johansson and the elegant bottle with the pink juice. I loved the poster of this perfume starring her and I always thought that one day I would have this perfume and I would feel like her wearing it. It was truly magical. Finally that wasn't just a dream as I now own Eternity Moment and it will always remind me of good old times.",08/20/17 13:13,lulami
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I need to test this again. When I tested it, something really bothered me in the scent. One or two of the notes, really could not put my finger on it, was just totally off-putting. And I have no problem whatsoever with light, generic, breezy, flowery scents so based on the reviews I will give this another try.",06/20/17 23:07,trucalling
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"So many perfumes come to mind trying this one - starting from Jean Paul Gaultier`s `Fragile` to Calvin Klein Escape..I should like it, really, but it doesn`t happen. It just turns sour on me as soon as it starts to develop after drying on my skin. In the end I have to ask myself: what occasion would justify wearing it? And I can`t find any..I don`t find it uplifting, refreshing, seductive, innocent, show-off..I wouldn`t say it stinks either but the original one is the one I always used to know and liked - I could even do with a bottle now - but this one is just sour and confusing..Maybe I should give it a second testing..",05/29/17 11:08,meliecat
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Oh so fresh and bright!! Eternity Moment lifts my mood instantly. Beautiful fresh floral! Perfect for everyday wear. Lasts pretty long on clothes, stays close to skin but people next to you will be able to smell it, especially when the wind blows, it gently gets carried away creating a beautiful trail that will surely bring many compliments! I feel Eternity Moment is best for romantic,femenine,happy and free spririted women! I feel this pairs gorgeously with airy floral summer dresses and and a cheerful,happy personality. Definitely one of my favorites and the one I most reach for!!",05/14/17 21:20,Sweet.Wildflower

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I have it given away by a friend who absolutely hated it - well, I like it and it is definitely better on my skin than on hers, but to me it is a bit too aggressive though. I like wearing it when I have to go to work early in the morning - the fresh scent can totally wake me up! During the daytime it becomes boring though, and I would not wear it for night, as to me it totally goes with a business suit, creating a rather cold although energetic aura.",04/28/17 09:15,lazy_lizard
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Unfortunately, the peony is far too strong for me here. It's almost all I can smell. It smells like lots and lots of peony with some lily, musk and sandalwood. Although, it initially smells OK in a bottle - appears flowery and fresh - when I spray it on, very soon it starts to smell very strong and heavy and, for me, it is also headache inducing. Unfortunately, this one's not for me. This fragrance is extremely flowery and , although, I generally love flowery scents, there is something here that really does not agree with me.",04/12/17 02:56,Ella09
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"This is the perfume I reach for when I want something for work or a day time fresh perfume. It reminds me of a dressing table my mum had with her powder puff, to me it smells just like powdery makeup. It's great for spring and most people wouldn't not like it, I would say it's safe to blind buy, but it is very generic. It's like when I sat in waiting rooms when I was younger flipping through the magazines and sniffing the fragrance sample pages. In a word - this perfume is boring, but not necessarily in a bad way. I'm pleased to have it in my collection as I don't have anything else like it and it's trustworthy to not offend anyone and it's so light and fresh but it isn't something I would run out and buy tomorrow if I finished it. It's a like but not a love.",04/11/17 14:53,Toffeefountain
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Eternity Moment is a very nice light fruity floral. I detect mostly peony, water lily and fruit with a touch of musk. I find this fragrance to be well balanced. It moves from top notes to middle notes and finally to base notes fluidly, unlike some fragrances which can seem muddled. Eternity Moment has a very feminine air about it. It's one of my favorite perfumes.",03/12/17 20:10,kyl77
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"It was a birthday gift from someone who loves me, but don't really know me.

Clean, fruity floral, subtle even during the summer, ideal sweet water for the days you're not in a mood for A perfume but you still want to wear something. It's just wearable without smelling commonly cheap, but nothing more.

It's nice, tender, airy, clean, but funny - even during the time it was on my shelf, I could never precisely remember how it smells if wasn't wearing it that very moment.
That is what best describes Eternity Moment.

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I was super excited to try Calvin Klein’s Eternity Moment since peony is one of my favorite florals and I have never smelled water lily in a fragrance before. That being said, this perfume is a major disappointment; it literally smells like the most generic drug store body spray you can imagine. It’s a brew of synthetic scents that leaves behind a very unpleasant odor of plastic and damp skin.

The initial spray smells heavily of alcohol, then immediately simmers down to a peony opening with litchi and a hint of jasmine. The water lily gives this fragrance a fresh and bright floral composition which helps to bury the scent of plastic that eventually overwhelms me anyway. The dry down consists of sandalwood and Guava, which creates a very unusual accord similar to fruit that’s been sitting in a smoky room for way too long. I don’t smell cashmere woods, though the musk is a bit overwhelming and strangely out of place in this composition. Sillage is moderate on me, and longevity is decent (3-4 hours).


I feel like Eternity Moment has way too much going on, the notes seem to clash against one another instead of flowing smoothly in unison. It tries to be woody, fruity, floral, and aquatic at the same time…but fails to master at any. I’ve tried to wear this on my skin after a shower, before bed, during the day, at night; and I can’t seem to enjoy it. Overall this is a decent purchase for the price but it certainly is short of quality, you can buy a generic body spritzer for half the cost.",11/22/16 20:05,Coffee_Girl
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Bought this for a friend of mine for her birthday today as I know she wears the original Eternity, when she got it she opened it immediately and sprayed some on her wrist, smelled gorgeous to me from about a meter away (this is a male point of view btw) a couple hours later she text me to say she loves it. ""It's Lighter than the original but really fresh"" is how she described it. She's taking it with her to a pamper session this weekend with her BFF.

Adorable sillage and longevity! (easily all day and fills the room softly)

I really love Calvin Klein's perfumes. I've only got a few - these two, of course, and Eternity Aqua, Euphoria, CKIn2U, Obsession and Beauty - but hopefully will be able to get more when the money comes! But I totally adore the few I have. They're all gorgeous.",10/15/16 12:19,7BlackAngel7

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I was so expecting to like this. Perhaps I set my hopes too high. On me Eternity Moment is surprisingly generic, similar to many lower-end fruity fragrances. It's on the fresh-sour side of fruity, rather than sweet, so comes off as a little cold to my nose.

It has a particular similarity to Siren by Paris Hilton, which I really like (yup), but without the warmer, juicier notes that make Siren friendly and summery. Eternity Moment is for a cooler kind of lady.

It has good sillage and decent longevity though, so if you like the fragrance it will serve you well.",08/22/16 02:19,Delila

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Wow! I am impressed! I bought this one as a blind buy because of the good reviews and also the ingredients and the noses behind it. I knew the original Eternity from my teenage years, my best friend wore it all the time. I knew it couldn't go that wrong, first spray was already wonderful, this is a more mature and sofisticated fragrance. This fragrance gets even more delicious at the base and dry down. Peony, jasmin and lychee are quite predominant to me, what makes it a delicious flowery-fruity fragance. I do smell the woody as well. It kinda reminds me of D&G Rose the One, one of my personal favorites. I also though funny enough there was some rose in it at the first spray. The price is also amazing, 19.99 euros on the local drugstore for 100 ml of this delicious juice, don't know why it is such an underestimated fragrance, but yey me! I will definitely keep purchasing it for the spring/summer time.",03/16/16 02:12,karen.fiallos

The last time I smelled it it smelled more unique than before. It has that touch to it which is unexplicable.",02/20/16 06:32,Vera Bosch
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"This smells like springtime to me - not the first green breath of spring - that would be the original Eternity, but later in spring when the sweet scent of blossoms are in the air from flowers and fruit trees. It is very feminine in an innocent, ethereal, young at heart (but not girly) kind of way. I find it lasts well without being overpowering. I can still smell it a little in the evening from a few sprays in the morning. I love it and it makes me feel cheerful at the thought of springtime.",01/31/16 03:37,Astrogenie

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"A more feminine and elegant take on this Calvin Klein classic. If i had to choose between both, i'd take this one as it has more hints of floral and vague fruit.

However, i personally still find this a little too much on the ""fresh"" side and strong for my liking, so i barely wear it. I've had my bottle of it since it released in '04 and it's still a full bottle.

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"A gorgeous, mature scent. It's all floral for me, with a tone of sweet fruitiness in the background, but in no way an ""old lady"" floral.

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"My first experience with this perfume was over 10 years ago. I was a teenager and i brought a 15 ml Eternity Moment together with a 15 ml etnerity. I liked Eternity Moment alright but admittedly it did not have the strong character that Eternity had. Eternity is so modern and so cold. Eternity Moment was however, a very pleasant lady like and easy to wear perfume.

Little did i know it would be Eternity Moment that leave an impression on me to the point that I crave it and get a full bottle of it 10 years later. I am very glad to report there is no reformulation. It smells fruity-rosy-green (in the order of predominance) as i remember it is. On me litchi, raspberry, jasmine, and what i thought as rose (? rose is not listed hmmm?) mixes together to produce a refreshing and uplifting scent until about 4-5 hours later, I get melon and guava. Strange because usually fruit is the top note.

It lasts about 4-5 hours. Soft sillage after an hour or two upon application. This perfume performs in both summer and winter, good weather or bad.",01/04/16 01:51,AnnaT

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"There are certain moments when a particular type of perfume is more appropriate. It was in a moment of impulse shopping that I bought this yesterday after trying CKs Reveal which turned sickly nasty sweet.

I used to wear Eternity Moment a few years ago but I couldn’t really remember it other than it is supposed to be a fresh floral and I had liked it. But on wearing it today, I can say it’s not really fresh at all. I wouldn’t call it aquatic either unless by taking a full on floral and then watering it down, you could call it aquatic. Despite all the fruit notes that are supposed to be there, I get none. The bottle is elegant.

Eternity Moment is a bouquet of unidentifiable flowers, musky, powdery, lightly woody and classic. I think any woman could wear this and it wouldn’t be too young or too old. I think it could be worn at any time of year or time of day and it wouldn’t be considered out of place.

Generic? Hell yeah. Inoffensive? Undoubtedly. Eternity Moment is for moments when you need to be feminine and poised rather than sultry or carefree. Hopefully those moments won’t last for an eternity.",06/15/15 01:15,Swamp Lily

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I'm wearing Eternity Moment on my left wrist and Eternity on my right wrist. I see where CK was going with this one. This is a much more delicate scent compared to its mother scent, Eternity. Comparing the two together, I like both for very different reasons.

This is a spring/early summer fragrance that is very fresh, slightly woody and is reminiscent of blush coloured flowers (the peonies etc). A spring wedding fragrance that has echoes of the original classic, but not as big in personality, this will last the whole day and not be offensive or overpowering. It has presence, but it is respectful and inoffensive. I'd wear this to a high tea on weekend for sure!

Interesting bottle. It isn't as solid as the original eternity bottle. EM's bottle is taller and has a transparent lid. I think the marketing people are getting at the fact that yes, it is a 'moment' hence the transparent lid (as opposed to the 2 in 1 silver lid sprayer or the original bottle). The bottle is reminiscent of a Moment of the original Eternity as opposed to the boldness of the enduring, classic, Eternity. Maybe I'm being too philosophical here?!",05/23/15 19:00,vanillabean23

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Bought this blind because of the good reviews on here, thinking it would be light and refreshing. I love the original Eternity - I use it to give me confidence in powerhouse meetings - and thought this would be a lighter, more girly equivalent. It's not.

It's a very old-fashioned smell, a bit like rose-and-jasmine-scented talc in the 70's, not at all light, modern or aquatic. I didn't get any lichi/lychee at all, possibly a little peony. Thankfully it didn't last long on me.

Slightly like Elizabeth Arden Splendor, which I also dislike for the same reasons.",04/15/15 09:39,Fabulista
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Nice fresh, clean smelling scent. I first smelt it on someone in the gym and it was just perfect, fresh but not strong. i find it a great scent for excercise etc but just a very light spray does it.

So today...I'm in there looking around and they have a whole big shelf full of 19.99 perfumes, but they have no testers so it's a blind buy if you've not smelled it before..and I decided to buy eternity moment...I'm very glad I did! It has a classic smell to it, and it's very pretty smelling! Not something I would normally go for, but in building up my collection...it fits in for a nice change! Very fresh, very airy!

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Tried this at a friends house, and loved it so much I went straight home and ordered a 30ml bottle online from Amazon....it arrived and I am so happy with it, its a gentle and classy light floral....gentle but do not confuse that with weak....it is definately not weak, it lasts me forever ( approx 6-7+ hours) reading here that it may be discontinued....I panicked and bought 2 100ml bottles straight away, I dont want to ever be without this beautiful perfume.
I can hand-on-heart say, that as a flanker, this beauty is better than the original, I think lovers of Eternity will probably not like this.
Some have mentioned old lady......there is nothing old lady in this scent, its fresh, floral, musky and beautiful, I think if you love SJP Lovely, you would also love this. Its a very pretty fragrance, classy and feminine and completely gorgeous.
EDITED to add, I couldnt put my finger on what Eternity Moment reminded me of, and this morning it came to me.... SJP Lovely has a very similar vibe, I think that anyone that loves SJP Lovely will also love this.",02/01/15 02:51,RaggedyAnne

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I really didn't think I would enjoy this perfume as much as I do! :)

Received the original for Christmas last year and found it smelled like an 80's powerhouse perfume and had to get rid of it.

This flanker is very different from the original, one of those moments when you're like, 'why is this even a flanker?'

Anyways, Eternity Moment is a lovely, timeless scent.

Some say 'old lady' but I think that's just because it lacks any trendy or super contemporary notes, as well as the fact that it is quite heady (I don't where people get the idea that 'old lady' is a bad thing anyways though, to be honest ^_^)

The perfume starts off with a pretty high-pitched hit of white florals, but quickly begins to even out as the florals melt away into a sweet (not sugary!), fruity blend that is almost a floral skin scent.

I smell this and I feel myself drifting back in time.

I am convinced this is exactly what Marie Antoinette smelled like!

Or at least Kirsten Dunst while playing her in the Sofia Coppola film... ;-)

I see a beautiful, flower adorned swinging bench in a clearing in a dense and beautiful forest with a slight refreshing breeze carrying this fragrance in the air.

I see lace gloves, and heavily decorated tea cups.

This perfume says princess to me, but not in the bubble gum, sugary kind of way.

The name is Moment but I think this should have been the original Eternity because I feel like this scent has no era and it has super intense sillage and longevity.

Near the end, the fragrance relaxes into a creamier scent as the amber slowly begins to consume the sharp white florals.

The fragrance is also ageless, perfect for the flower girl or the mother of the bride.

I love to spray this on my sheets, not because it's a 'meh' perfume that I don't care to waste or anything, but because who doesn't want to go to sleep and wake up feeling and smelling like royalty? ;-)",01/24/15 13:18,MsGoody2Shoes
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"A basic floral perfume. Not unpleasant, but doesn't leave an impression at all. Therefore there's nothing to hate or love about it. I could tell it was made with some sort of lily, but I didn't smell the nice, wonderful jasmine scent from it (I used to grow jasmine in my yard, so I'm very familiar with the scent of real jasmine flowers, and I love it). All the sweet fruity notes were also nowhere to be detected. It is light and modern though. I’ll wear this on the days when I don't feel like perfume. But I think on most days I'll layer it with another just-fruity perfume, since that's what it's lacking.

I give it 7/10.",01/22/15 23:40,Treslicious
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I got this fragrance after reading excellent reviews all over. Having extensively searched for a fragrance with heart notes of Peony, I finally thought of giving this a try and I am highly impressed!
Eternity moment smells heavenly!! Its a refreshing floral fragrance which I feel is not at all overpowering..with just the right amount of sweetness its beautifully feminine. The top notes I get are guava, melon and rasberry. They are strong but quickly settles down into delicate floral. I can detect peony and jasmine in the heart notes. Base notes of sandalwood and amber are very light and soothing.
Just like its name Eternity moment is a long lasting fragrance. Without being too strong it stays on for 7+ hours (even more if layered).

I feel Eternity moment is very similar to CK's cool water sea rose (again my favoirite) except for the staying power - sea rose is very delicate and not at all long lasting. If you liked sea rose then you will Love eternity moment!!

Update: This is really strong!!!! be careful how much you apply otherwise it really gets to your head!!",12/30/14 05:29,Rutuja152
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"I got this for my step daughter, The Young Goddess as I call her, for her seventeenth birthday in February. Eternity Moment is absolutely wonderful. She had been with me testing different floral fragrances which are her favorites. I had already bought her Chanel Chance Tendre for Christmas so she decided on this. It is so unique and it is so very feminine. It is hard to pick out the notes but I do smell quite a bit of peony. It is light, fresh and gorgeous.

Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Definitely getting more iterested in exploring as many of Calvin Klein's range as I can. This one is a beauty, it has to be said. I find quite a few CK's have a bit of a chemical essence to them, none of that here at all. The initial spritz is a pretty heavy white floral burst, definitely get Jasmine, and what I thought was tuberose, as it dries down I get the slightly floral/woody base with a musky background, which all in all is quite wonderful, Love it. 9/10",11/26/14 06:34,Coffee King
Eternity Moment Calvin Klein,"Yes it is fresh (at least it smells clean) and floral, but its very disappointing to me. Its not as light as i had hoped.

The staying power is super, In my hair I can smell it still after tree days! So, if you like roses, soap and jasmine, this should be great for you. I don't like it...at all!",11/22/14 06:26,MarjaV

While it doesn’t break new ground in the perfume world, it delivers a reliable and familiar charm, reminiscent of the original Calvin Klein Eternity but with a clear shift toward the crisp, aquatic vibe that defines blue fragrances.

The longevity is surprisingly solid, holding its character for around three hours or more. I can’t say for certain how well it projects.

This isn’t the kind of scent that will stop people in their tracks with a “wow” factor, but it works well as an easy, casual choice — especially for warm summer days when you want something clean, refreshing, and effortless. A safe, everyday option that gets the job done without fuss.",08/15/25 10:41,mhe

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"For When You’re Floating in a Pool of Denial and Cucumber Water

The opening is a splash of cucumber and lemon—like a chilled glass of water with a perfect slice of citrus on the rim. You’re floating in the pool, no plans, no worries, a lotus flower drifting nearby as its delicate aroma mixes with the green, herbaceous chill of the air. Sweet, watery, and just clean enough to fool everyone into thinking you’ve got your life together.

As it settles, lavender and sea breeze kick in like the scent of a beach house that’s been open for days—calm, airy, and quietly confident. The dry down goes smooth with sandalwood, musk, and a hint of driftwood, like the final whisper of dusk before the night wakes up.

It’s masculine, but in a breezy, button-down kind of way. Less “chopping firewood,” more “mixing cucumber gin tonics in linen pants.” Think Nautica Voyage, but older, cleaner, and finally over his ex.

This is a chick magnet and so are pretty much all aquatic fragrances. Girls love aquatic, cucumbery, fruity, basic, boring fragrances... luckily this I don't think is boring or too basic it's got some depth to it with the green notes, wood, lotus and it's like an aromatic aquatic scent. Just imagine you took D&G light blue or Versace pour homme then made it more interesting, more woody, more aromatic then you have CK eternity aqua... How's the performance? It's very good for me last way longer than versace pour homme and this stuff has always gave me good performance all day for an aquatic scent is impressive. Not outdated, smells better than majority of stuff on the market today.

The dry down? A smooth mix of sandalwood, musk, and driftwood—like the last whisper of night before the dawn. It’s not loud, but it lingers with quiet confidence, reminding you that you’ve got your life together, even if it’s just the illusion of it. Masculine, but not rugged—more like someone who’s effortlessly cool without even trying. Think Nautica Voyage, but grown-up—someone who’s upgraded from the frat house to the beach house, and it’s all happening without a single word of effort.

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"TL:DR - Harsh opening but otherwise very good scent, terrible longevity.

I blind bought this because of it's similar profiles to other fragrances I like but cheaper price tag. My immediate thought on first spray was that I mostly smelled alcohol, but thankfully that disappeared quite quickly. What remained was a refreshingly pleasant aroma - like a somewhat more mature Polo Blue or Nautica. It's a smell that can be a summer scent both day and night, unlike some brighter ""blue"" colognes.

However, the major problem with this bottle didn't show up until a few hours after I put it on - or rather didn't show up. An hour after application this was a skin scent. By two hours, it was barely noticeable. By hour three it was gone completely. I am aware everyone has different body chemistry, and for me fragrances tend to wear off a bit on the quick side, but this is a contender for fastest vanishing act.

So if I want to smell really good for a short while, this is a great find. If I want something that I can apply before leaving for the day, then I'll need to look elsewhere. This may become my summertime ""keep-in-the-car"" bottle.",09/12/24 12:54,DaCrazyJamez

When I wear this cologne, I feel clean and fresh as if I just got out of the shower. I often turn to this cologne for daily use in the summer. It's very easy to wear. In the high inflationary conditions in Turkey, this cologne is one of the colognes that can be ideal for daily use in the summer months with its cheap price.

So I went and did what any fragrance lover worth their salt would do, I repurchased it. I didn't think much of changes in formulation or performance, I figured just the scent would be enough.

I've been left a tiny bit disappointed though, I don't remember it being this flat. I wasn't expecting much but I'm left feeling a bit silly, with my dick in my hand.

Update: This isn't the strongest frag, so I tend to overspray. There is a chemical smell that occurs when I use a few too many sprays. Its an acrid, almost bitter chemical smell that only appears if I use too much.

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein Eternity Aqua for Men instantly captivated my senses in the best possible way. Intrigued by its distinct aroma, I asked a stranger about his cologne, and he was delighted to share. I could tell I made his day with my compliment.

The sillage is exceptional, creating an aura within a two-meter radius, even more pronounced with a breeze. The scent reached me before I saw the wearer, which speaks volumes about its presence. Eternity Aqua offers a unique blend, borrowing from classic summery aqua fragrances while introducing its own distinctive character.

Wearing it for the first time, I’m consistently surprised by the refreshing wafts that emanate from me. The name ""Aqua"" is truly apt, and the Sichuan pepper note adds an intriguing twist that I find irresistible. I can’t stop smelling my wrist. This is undoubtedly my new weekday go-to fragrance.

Although it’s an Eau de Toilette, and thus not the longest-lasting, its brilliant and vibrant presence is like a shooting star—brief but unforgettable. At $69.99 for a 200ml bottle, it’s an absolute steal.",06/14/24 19:34,Kranski985

Definitely an office fragrance, not offensive, and I do like it. Not a love. I love the original Eternity for Men.",03/10/24 01:36,websterdaniel

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,Aquatic and musky a lot like Davioff Cool Water but with a completely different tone to it.

Definitely an improvement on Eternity.,01/04/24 23:03,Antoshka2
Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"I quite like this fragrance. I have had Polo Blue Parfum sometime ago and heard that Eternity Aqua was similar in scent from reviews i had read so thought i would give this a try.

It's a very fresh and aquatic fragrance that is a good daily scent for anytime. I think you can get away with this at a casual event too so work its perfect for and semi smart events too so a nice restaurant. I find it more of a spring summery scent or early autumn, although i think it can be suitable for anyone wanting to smell very fresh, clean and aquatic.

It's also a good fragrance choice for someone looking for Polo Blue at a cheaper price. This can be bought cheaply in drug stores or online at a reasonable price of around £25.00-£30.00 in the UK. Maybe cheaper on eBay.

I would buy this again but i do like to cycle through dailies and try others to see how they sit on me, as fragrances always differ on the persons natural aroma.

Silage is okay i think it lasts for about 2-3 hours depending on applications but max id say is 6 hours. I can smell it after a long day when i go to the gym and i get warm but its not overpowering. Just a nice clean scent.",12/22/23 10:30,Gentginge96
Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"I personally love this. In spite of all the other fresh aquatic summer types of scents, something stands out to me. It’s just a nice aquatic scent. The cucumber and lotus are well blended and peak through the aquatics nicely.

Funny story, I’ll need to buy a new bottle and here’s why. I got a 6.7 fl oz bottle for roughly $35 from Fragrancenet.com. Had it for over a year, and enjoyed it. Left it in my car where the temperature fell below 32°F. I thought it would be fine as fragrances are meant to be kept cool, but NO. It smells like pure harsh chemicals now.

Sandalwood, musk, and patchouli on the back end. Good value. Decent projection for the price. I'd take this over Acqua Di Gio because of the price. They smell very similar. If you don't mind reapplying after 3-4 hrs., then get this.",09/02/23 07:22,bygcoolrr44
Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,I would buy this before spending $100 on Aqua di Gio that will give you just as horrible longevity. Fresh aquatic scents are all equally as boring and generic.

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"After just reading ""smellmyfingers"" take on this, and really pondering on it, I changed my mind on what I was gonna post. I seen mentioned this used to be a powerhouse and realizing the $22 bottle I got, doesn't punch like I remember. Long ago when I first smelled it, when it came out, had that Polo Blue vibe but way more depth. I really loved it and still do but I can definitely see how much my taste has evolved over a decade.
For the price, it's definitely toilet bowl lid worthy. You get the premium extra courtesy treatment. Thanks to ""smellmyfingers"" this won't just head to the back of my stuff that I thought was good that I just don't grab.

it has some good vibes going on and smells like your out at the beach but i dont live at the beach and people are angry very angry so its best to wear something more dark and depressing

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"I really enjoy the opening. Hit's all those familiar and likable aquatic/blue notes. The dry-down sort of kills it for me though. I don't care for aquatics that turn to sharp wood, which is where this goes after ~20min to me. Longevity is what I'd expect for this brand/product.
Scent opening - 9/10

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Just got a 100ml bottle for 25 bucks. My first thought: what a great value!

It is similar to polo blue family, just like them, smells fresh and crisp, is perfect for mornings right after shower.

I would say it is a safe blind buy, will not offend anyone and 100% office safe.

Personally, the most appealing part is that it is very fresh without depending solely upon citrus notes. Nowadays most male designer fragrances are either bubble gummy or citrus-y, this is neither of these, I get a little vintage 90s vibe.

Conclusion: if you are looking for a fresh everyday fragrance and like watery notes, this can be a great alternative.

Happy smelling!",01/06/23 11:10,Proximo

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Very light, crisp, penetrating scent. Not the same, but in the same category as Versace Man Eau Fraiche, with more oomph.

I get more watery cucumber and citrus in the foreground, with musk and wood notes in the background. Not getting the lavender or plum; nothing is remarkably floral or sweet about it.

I blind-bought it early on when I started collecting. I was not upset with it, but I have found many more options that would fill the role of a shower gel-Esque fragrance that I would choose over this one.

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,This is why bother for me. I get a sharp waft of alcohol when I spray it and when that dissipates there is nothing more than a faint shower gel type smell. I use it sometimes since I bath with natural unscented soap and want to use it up. I dose myself in 6 or 10 sprays as I'm drying off and I smell fresh for a bit. A good shower gel will perform as well but the scent is ok. Not worth much in my opinion though.,12/20/22 16:01,L'Whiff
Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Yet another of the many flankers to the classic 1990s aromatic Eternity by Calvin Klein. Eternity Aqua is a great fragrance in it's own right and the scent is more contemporary than the original Eternity. Eternity Aqua is a fresh blue scent with reasonable longevity and performance and a very wearable, pleasant scent that is suitable for most occasions in the warmer months. The opening really catches me with some nice sweet fruity and fresh notes, smells almost unisex and brings to mind a sunny spring day. As the fragrance settles on my skin I detect a little of the pepper and then later in the dry-down it settles to a nice fresh scent with prominent floral and woody notes. For a cheaper fragrance Eternity Aqua is excellent, not an outstanding composition, but a very nice fragrance that has a decent trajectory. I've really enjoyed wearing Eternity Aqua and although the original Eternity for Men is also great and has more nostalgic value for me, I think I now favour Eternity Aqua more. Eternity Aqua lasts a good 6 or 7 hours on my skin and projection is arm length, becoming a more intimate skin scent by the end of the day. A nice summer freshie and excellent value.",12/03/22 22:36,FragrantBob
Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"I 110% agree with Rockdj's review below.

What I don't think anyone reviewing this now in 2022 realises is that they're smelling almost an entirely different fragrance from when this first came out.

And no I'm not doing the usual Fragrantica ""they reformulated this"" meme. I have actual proof.

I have two bottles, one I've held onto since 2012, the other from around 2019/2020 (hardly used, you'll soon find out why). The difference is dramatic.

My 2012 bottle is a lot more clearer, cleaner, smoother, and aquatic, and almost has a kind of ever-so-slight sweetness to it that makes you want to bathe in it. The old formulation ""cuts"" through high humidity and doesn't build up and waft around you. At the time, it was a really sexy smell (it's dated now), and I used to get a ton of compliments on it from women.

My 2019/2020 bottle is almost an entirely different fragrance and can be summed up by two words POWDERY SOAP. A nauseating old man powdery soap smell that is cloying in summer and high humidity. The old formulation ""cuts"" through humidity and heat, and this newer bottle hangs around you like a stomach-churning powdery musky soap cloud.

My older bottle still has those powdery, musky notes, but it's pulled back BEHIND the clearer, cleaner, aquatic notes. The newer bottle is just boisterous cloying powdery, musky soap... It's gross.

If someone did want to wear the modern version of this, I would actually recommend it as more of a spring scent. The new reformulation is now way too musky and cloying in high-heat and high-humidity situations. I'm an expat working in a highly humid/tropical area of the world, and there's no way I'd want to wear the newer version unless it was to make people gag around me.",10/24/22 19:46,delancy

The fragrance was magnificent with great sillage, projection and longevity. A very nice and a super affordable aquatic fragrance. I got a new 6.8 oz bottle for my collection and what i got is a very downgrade watery fragrance of my beloved Eternity Aqua. I’m really disappointed i can’t believe what they have done to this fragrance, one of the best eternity flankers ever made. I can even barely smell it on my clothes, no projection, nobody commenting about the fragrance… the magic is over.

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"When comes to aquatics both in and out of this price range honestly to me this is a 3.75/5. It may be just for me but this fragrance is pretty synthetic whilst the opening is very pleasing the dry dow is fairly meh. It's a bit too woody and it kind of ruins the vibe of the cologne. I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you have smelled it and liked it. Alternatives that i think are better for both in and out of this price range are Nautica voyage, ADG EDP, Profondo, Missoni Wave, Azzaro Chrome, and Luna Rossa Ocean. Longevity is decent I notice it for u to 5 hrs on my skin more or less on others but it's not terrible. The scent is just kind of average, nice, but there is better.",06/21/22 12:32,Sushii
Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"@DustyMemphis the idea is to have the scent stay which is why people need to learn to spray on their clothes instead of skin??? That's just wrong in so many ways. While yes, spraying clothing will make a scent last a little longer, but it defeats the the other idk...95% of what a cologne/perfume does. And that is to change and mix with your body chemistry! That does not and will not happen on clothes. If you have a problem with it lasting on skin then you need to look at your skin, It is most likely dried out which cause the alcohol to evaporate quicker and taking the scent with it. Use unscented lotion on your pulse points and where you're gonna spray so your skin is nice and hydrated. Then as the cologne goes through the top notes and middle notes and base, it will mix with your body chemistry truly unleashing the potential in the scent. This is also why we spray on pulse points because fragrances react to heat. Also another reason why wearing a good summer fragrance outside in the sun will radiate with goodness!",05/24/22 16:18,chesterthejester

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Very similar to Polo Blue as everyone says.
Not the same though, and if PB’s up your street there’s no reason not to own both.
Aqua I find very slightly heavier and quite a lot longer lasting. That alone makes it better value. Often I get a whole working day out of it.
The plumb and lotus really shine on this one for me. The note it shares with Polo Blue, cucumber, is fleeting.
It has that slight touch of old school soap that tends to be standard with all Eternity’s I’ve smelled.
Quite thin on the ground now, so if you come across it, I recommend you pick it up.",02/24/22 12:49,Spendthrift
Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"TLDR: This scent is more suited for men above the age of 25, it is a outdated smelling scent.

Opening: It is creamy on opening with large amounts of synthetic floral and aquatic notes. Very fresh smelling, similar to a lavender Lysol spray. The separation of notes is poor, to my nose I can only pick out two or three of the listed notes.

Drydown: Upon drydown it warms up a bit with a soapy dryer sheet type of vibe. Longevity is poor while projection is strong for the first hour. Grassy notes come forward a bit during the drydown. Lasts about 4 hours total on my skin, the strong projection combined with the synthetic smell is a bit nauseating. It smells like something my grandmother might wear.

In conclusion there are better aquatic/fresh fragrances out there, for the price paid ($34) it is not worth the money. A better ""fresh"" fragrance at a cheaper price would be Midnight Voyage by Nautica or Versace Eau Fraiche for a bit more money, both smell more modern and higher quality.

They are in the same ballpark, both are fresh, aquatic, very early 2000s, kind of generic scents.

I don't think smelling one of these fragrances gives you that good of an idea what the other is like.

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"I really like this unassuming little fragrance.

For me it manages to be both inoffensive and interesting, and it's proved to be useful in lots of different situations; principally as a safe, clean work scent and as a relaxing before-bed lavender scent. I initially bought it for the cucumber note, which I love, but I'd say that all of the top and mid notes are detectable, and enjoyable.

People have already highlighted the key characteristics - airy, salty, clean, casual. It has a green side as well as a musky side, and also a slight beachy aspect, like sun-bleached driftwood. Really impressive for £20/100ml.

EDIT: The dry down is also really good. Musk is there, and there is a faint version of Guaiac wood, coming across as more of a bleached, sandy driftwood. Totally casual and laid back.

2nd Update: Having put this away for a couple of years, I've worn it this week in sunny, 28 degree heat. In that setting it's an absolute banger. Like being splashed with azure, salty water, then settles down to musk with hinds of plum. So good in the heat!!",01/14/21 07:17,non.operational

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"CK Eternity Aqua is a SWEET-FLORAL-SOAPY-AQUATIC

Starts out moderately sweet and floral almost perfumish (like the og CK Eternity), then a salty marine accord is added in along with some light soapyness (soapy like the og CK Eternity, just not as bold); once it dries the sweetness and floralness turns down some (but is still noticeable), the light soapyness it still there but the saltiness becomes faint as clean and airy light musk comes in, the dry smells very similar to CK Eternity Air just airy and clean; It's a tad sweet and a bit floral but it's a good clean smelling mass appealing fragrance. People are saying it's similar to Polo Blue... I'd say Polo Blue is more masculine, less sweet, and more blue-aquatic. To me CK Eternity Aqua smells similar to Lacoste L.12.12 Bleu Powerful, both are sweet-floral aquatics, however, Eternity Aqua is more mature and marine-salty aquatic while L.12.12 Bleu Powerful is more youthful sweet blue/bleu-sport-aquatic.

Projection/Sillage: GOOD, not a 'beast mode' projection monster but is very aromatic w/ good 'scent bubble' for about 3-4 hours that radiates within 7 feet

Performance/Longevity: GOOD, will last on avg about 7-8 hours",12/13/20 00:42,abahvdbs
Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"I kind of see the similarities to Polo Blue but this fragrance isnt as boring. Its a nice aquatic, airy, salty fragrance. Cucumber is very noticeable and lovely, and the green notes and lavender mix very well. Smells very nice and clean for the hot months. I'd rotate this out with my other aquatics in the summer no doubt. Its not the most unique smell in the book but youd be hard pressed to find someone say they dont like it. Easy to go nose blind to though

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,love aqua eternity got a big 6.4 bottle and a 3.4 . it smells like fresh melons cucumber and polo blue . i like it better then polo blue because it has a more freshness to it like your on a beach somewhere where polo blue fails a lil.. 2016 2017 reviewed bottles,11/30/20 17:29,yourthemanowdog
Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"The first time I smelled this fragrance it was too salty/stenchy, I don't really know the word for it, but it was quite unpleasant for me to smell, but as I try it more it kind of grows into me, I started to notice the freshness and I like it.

It's fresh and calming, good scent to wear during the daytime, in the office, school, or just casual activities during a quite hot daytime, nothing outstanding but it does its job.

Sillage is average in my opinion, not too striking on the nose but not too subtle as well, for the longevity it's kind of weak to moderate.

THAT is the difference between the original being made in France and my current bottle being made in Germany? WTF do Germans know about frags(besides Mercedes who make quality stiff)

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"It opens up with a watery surge of cucumber, lotus, and green notes. As it dries down on my skin, the pepper starts to stand out with some faint woods in the background.

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Quite possibly one of the best affordable freshies out there. It's really nothing like the Polo, this is a soft elegant fresh aquatic that projects moderate and performs for about 4 hours. For the price, it is absolutely acceptable. I have a vintage bottle from 10 years ago, not sure if there's any difference in the scent itself nowadays, but I enjoy it non the less. It's very clean and fresh. Nothing to complain about here.",12/12/19 10:34,alanwake
Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Not bad for hot, humid summers. This is what I wear when this get warm and muggy and I just want to smell fresh around the house or outdoors (think late-night 4th of July fireworks with the family). This is a classic crowd pleaser and gets compliments as much as more expensive scents do at other times of the year.

In the office, however, I find this to be rather forgettable (the strongest note is cucumber, after all). Anywhere you have dry, climate-controlled air you'll get nothing but top notes. Thus the scent doesn't come across as complex or interesting as others I have tried.

The best thing I like about Eternity Aqua is how fresh and natural it smells. You can use this for just about any situation if you wanted, I just think there are much better options for signature scents. For me this is a niche summer scent for chilling at home or with friends and family. For work, nights out, and cold weather I would have others to choose from.

Overall: recommended if you want to smell like you spent the day at a spa and want to blend in, not stand out.",12/11/19 11:50,misforwhat

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Clearly derivative of Polo Blue, Eternity Aqua manages to be a funner and more enjoyable wear on my skin, pushing the cucumber note so essential to Southeast Asian sensibilities of refreshment and cooling. Aqua performs well, smells like the Gulf coast beaches of Sarasota and Bradenton with a dose of fresh sliced cucumber in a glass of fizzy Sprite, and makes for an interesting balance of citrus, green and aquatic. While performance isn't remarkable, moderate in both sillage and longevity, I reach for this far more frequently than Polo Blue because it's less perfume like in its overall accord and wears more naturally with more quality than one would assume. A very good bargain fragrance that works effectively as a summer staple and signature.",07/30/19 09:25,PontifexMaximus

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Sprayed this on at the department store and literally walked 40 feet and was approached by a woman who politely asked, ""What the hell are you wearing?!!"" I was shocked and a bit embarrassed, because I thought that my sense of smell had failed me and that I had sprayed on a ""stinker."" However, she went on to tell me, ""I want MY man to smell like THAT!!!"" Long story short...a better version of Polo Blue that smoothly fades into an interesting-but-unavailable version of Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Giò. VERY NICE, especially for the $20 bucks that I paid for it. It stayed strong on my skin for about 4 1/2 hours. It's probably a monster on clothing. Spring and Summer only with this one, guys. It fits those seasons perfectly.

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Awesome punchy EDT.

I forgot I had this - I had a small bottle in my car arm rest for emergencies. I put it on in the dark and had to remind myself what this was.

Better than average budget Aquatic Ozonic - most reviews here are spot on.

A relief as the Plum and Cucumber punch strongly through for a fair bit making a change from the usual dominant citrus blends. Ozonic and a bit green - a bit salty. The pyramid here is somewhat fair.

Disagree with poor silage comments - if you think this doesn't project something is wrong - with decent 4 hours or so longevity.

I also own Eternity which is fairly safe - this is genuine flanker that has enough spin to justify keeping it next to the original as well for a hotter day! I also have no problem switching this between my Green Irish Tweed or say my Bulgari Aqua or Aqua Marine Tonique.

Again, fairly smooth for the price, if it is about budget or freshness for a change you won't regret this even as a blind buy.

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"A small 0.5 ounce bottle of this came with a 3.4 ounce of original Eternity. I was just testing it out and didn't like the open at all. I'm not for sure I like the smell of cucumbers unless eating them. The strange thing for me is I love the Acqua di Gio line, especially Essenza, Profumo and the basic version. This Eternity Aqua takes on a very similar scent during drydown as those AdG do. I keep smelling jasmine but there's no jasmine listed. I only notice it because I wear the AdGs a lot in spring so either I have AdG seeping from my pores or something in this creates a jasmine scent. It's not bad at all. Doesn't smell as refined as the AdG jasmine but it would be a good spring/summer scent for those looking for a cheaper alternative to AdG.",05/06/18 01:08,ShiveringTimber
Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Starts off smelling extremely similar to Polo Blue, with very prominent cucumber along with a bit of citrus. This fragrance leans very masculine. About 30 minutes in, it enters the drydown and becomes a spicy cucumber (the spice here being schezuan pepper), however the opening lasts much longer if sprayed on clothes. The drydown then ends up smelling like plums and schezuan pepper along with mild notes of citrus. The cucumber has totally disappeared at this point. It's a pleasant scent and very spicy. It smells like I have some good-smelling hot sauce on my body - as weird as that sounds, it smells pretty nice; this is due to the heavy shezuan pepper note which is perfectly blended with the plum note. Basenotes smell similar to the drydown. Sillage is moderate but leaning strong - I can still smell wafts of it hours after spraying - and longevity is also moderate at about 4-5 hours. Overall it's an interesting and pleasant fragrance, though I wish the cucumber note lasted longer and I think the shizuan pepper note is a bit strange in a fresh fragrance, while plum note though rare isn't the most appealing to me. Ultimately decided I didn't like it because the pepper is so realistic it feels like I have hot sauce on my skin - though some will enjoy that (kind of like the opposite of the cooling sensation of mint).

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Typical summer/aquatic scent: fresh, pleasant, watery . In the first 30 minutes. Then comes the nothing, only the soapy-watery notes. And it has the same problem as most of the summer scent: terrible sillage, with poor longevity. If you overdose the fragrance (6-8 sprays in every 2-3 hours), it will be great, but if you use only 3-4 sprays the scent will dissapear in the summer heat 1 hours later… The top note is the best part of the scent. I can sniff some citruses and cucumber (mixed with calone). Because of the cucumber the top smells similar than Ralph Lauren Polo Blue. In the mid I can smell a little bit of pepper with lavender, and the weak base contains some patchouli and sandalwood. After the drydown you really feel, the hard soapy-watery notes, but unfortunately, I don’t want to smell like soapy water. The perfume is a little bit unique with the cucumber note, but nothing special, not worth the money

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"This is a great scent at a great price point !

Eternity aqua is a fresh out of the shower smell that's a green smelling aquatic that's very light,airy and refreshing but in the base it does has some depth with the sandalwood and musk. This is a great casual scent for the warmer temperature and is also office friendly as long as you don't go over 5 sprays as this can get cloying although it smells very light.

A lot of people complain about performance issues but on me this has great performance as the first hour and a half I get very good projection and then for the duration of the scent you get a nice scent bubble but the best thing about the performance is that this leaves a nice sillage trail. Longevity on me is 5-8 hours !

Scents that this is very similar to are Polo Blue,Cool Water and sometimes there's notes that come out that slightly remind me of Just me by Paris Hilton which is an ADG clone. Also this does smell kind of similar to the original eternity but only once you get to the drydown does it show similarities. But if you hated the original I would say to still give this a shot because there not all that similar

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Eternity Aqua is a ""safe-bet"" fragrance. I'd say you'd be hard pushed to find anyone that finds it offensive.

Fresh and mild, has a salty ocean vibe that makes it good for summer or stuffy environments (such as offices etc).

As pleasant as it is personally i find it has a lack of character, a lot of aquatics smell similar to this. clearly a decision was made in Aqua's conception and marketing to be as far-reaching and appealing as possible.

It is a bit similar to Polo Blue to me but not quite. It has a cooler feel to it than most aquatics. I think that's the cucumber note though it doesn't smell quite like cucumber to me. It's nice. I get better longevity with this than Polo Blue and some other aquatics, get 6-8 hours it.

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"After spending more time with this fragrance I really have come to appreciate this !

The opening is very reminiscent of Polo Blue as it has a very crisp,cucumber,somewhat sharp, opening with black pepper in the background.

Even though the opening is great it does smooth out in the mid and in the mid is where this does have some similarites with the original eternity. The reason this has similarites is that it does start to go from being Polo Blue into smelling like a outdoorsy/green scented laudry sheet type of smell. (Actually when I wore this I was getting confused to what the smell around me was because when I put my clothes in the dryer I did use green/outdoorsy dryer sheets and didnt know if it was the dryer sheet smell or the cologne) But sure enough 4 hours later I smelled my arm and yes it was the cologne !!!

My girlfriend did NOT like this when I 1st sprayed it and even she thought it was Polo Blue(She thinks Polo Blue smells like nasty old spice,lol) but 1 hour later she said I changed my mind and I really like that 1 !!!
And for her thats awesome because she hates most of my frags !

Performance on this is great but also deceiving ! This lasts anywhere from 6-10 hours and projects great. One thing to be cautious of is that this is a scent that you will become nose blind too and even when you think the scent is gone others around you will still smell this so PLEASE use this stuff with caution. 3-4 sprays MAX as anymore than that and it starts to become cloying.

Overall rating im staying solid at an 8 out of 10 ! Great scent thats great for everyday use and this stuff has great performance as well which is rare for a freshie",03/28/16 10:06,Ryanmmas26
Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"First initial review:

To me this smells like a BETTER version of Polo Blue. Polo Blue was a great scent but I always wish the cucumber note was more pronouced as it gave the scent a refreshing quality and I also wished it didnt have as much spice as it kind of made Polo Blue a little lackluster. (still a good scent though)

This scent though is a big step up though as the cucumber is a lot more crisp and pronounced giving this scent a very refreshing quality and then once this dries down it becomes a little more warm as the lavender and green notes kick in but throughout the life of the fragrance it still keeps that freshness from the cucumber unlike in Polo Blue where you get an amazing opening but then shortly in the heart it becomes really muddy and dull smelling.

Performance on this is great for a fresh scent ! This projects really well and lasts 6-8 hours !

Id have to rate this an 8 out of 10 upon the first wearing ! I may rate this higher when i wear it more and I can see this being a staple in my freshie/summer/spring rotation",03/25/16 09:40,Ryanmmas26

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"This is my first CK fragrance and indeed it is a very well blended fragrance.

When people compared this to Polo Blue, I really wanted to buy this since I lost my Polo Blue under stupid circumstances. I don't know what is it with Ralph Lauren fragrances, they are obscenely overpriced even if discounted!

Yes, they are in the same vein, but compared to Polo Blue, Eternity Aqua is lighter, soapier, smoother and a tad thinner(not a bad thing). If you think about it, Polo Blue is quite strong especially with the metallic/ozonic qualities of its scent. Not so with Eternity Aqua. The ozone quality is dialed way down that not many people will find this cloying/in-your-face/offensive so this can be worn anytime be it in the office, engaging in casual activities, running errands or just hanging out.

Honestly speaking, Eternity Aqua is one of those fragrances that will smell familiar to you but you can't quite put a finger. On certain stages of its lifespan, this can give vibes of: Versace Pour Homme(after about 10 minutes, I currently have this), AXE PHOENIX(had this), L.12.12 Bleu or Vert(cannot remember), Kenneth Cole Reaction and CK One Summer 2013 (who knows what else!). In short, it is not that unique.

Make no mistake about it, this is a true aquatic but can easily be worn all year through since it can bring freshness when one so desires, which is really the point of using an aquatic anyway.

I acquired this blindly in the hopes that this would replace my Polo Blue but, alas, scentwise they are only in the same theme. The comparison is not the same as, say, Acqua di Gio with 360 Red, which can pass for each other.

On it's own it is a good cologne but I'm glad I only got the 100ml and not the 200ml. Now, the hunt is still on for a great deal on Polo Blue.

Will acquire again only on a good deal since longevity and projection are sorely lacking.",03/08/16 18:53,cell
Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"I don't get any cucumbers in the opening, or ever, as listed in the notes above. I get a kind of generic aquatic/greens blast for a good half an hour until it starts to dry down. Completely different from the original Eternity IMHO.

When it starts drying down I start smelling the lotus, lavender, roses (which isn't in the listed notes so it might just be my nose) and patchouli, would have never noticed the plum if I hadn't read the note breakdown but now that I see it I can smell hints of it. Then after about 4 hours, the floral notes give way to more patchouli, woodsy notes and musk at which time it smells almost identical to POLO BLUE. At this point I feel like it's a skin scent, but then when I walk by co-workers they are apparently left smelling the wake of it.

Even though its smells is reminiscent of like 100 different colognes and there's nothing really unique or special about it, the girls at my work seem to like how it smells on me. They like it waaay more than I do. And since it doesn't give me a headache I don't mind wearing it from time to time just to keep it fresh at work.

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Something about the Eternity frags that always has a nasty 'green' chemical dry-down to it. As far as aquatic scents go, its not bad, and does moderately in terms of projection and longevity. Its unoffensive and wearable anywhere - its just not stand-out. Then again, its not expensive. In that respect, you get what you pay for, but like I said, the dry-down leaves little to be desired.

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Since i have a fairly big collection, i purchased Eternity Aqua just for collection purpose, i had no expectations. After trying it i started to like it more and more, i even liked it more than the original (which i like for its nostalgic value), even though i didn't use it that much, the higher brands like Chanel and Cartier always took an advantage over it.
Recently i decided to give it a chance and use it before the summer ends, so i started wearing it to the office...it was a big surprise, i got tons of compliments, some of them were huge ones and came from unexpected people, women love it way more than expected (one asked me for a spray on her hand to keep sniffing it).
I don't actually wear nor pick my fragrances to get complements or for attraction, i wear what i do enjoy and what gives me the vibe that matches my mood, but to be honest, it's always a good refreshing thing to get a nice complement, now while I'm enjoying the uplifting refreshing almost salty feeling combined with the confidence that I'm smelling nice for people around me.
What a nice surprise from a brand that i usually tend to not appreciate that much.",09/16/15 23:04,tarek trabulsi
Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"I don’t claim to know much about perfumes but I know what I like. I like winter- the harsher and more brutal the winter the happier I get. Think frozen lakes, snow storms, gnashing winds and grey clouds. The movie Tron Legacy and Snow Falling on Cedars – best epitomises the scent best associated to these bleak dramas.

Think of rain, ferocious waves and fog. That foreboding image have a scent to it- a sharp, clean icy scent. If I can add a twist to the scent- snow laced with blood and semen.

So on with the review. Calvin Klein Aqua ruined my winter visage.Finally I finally came to understand that not all aquatics perfume are suitable to evoke wintry visage. This is surely the case with CK-Aqua.

The top note is very brief, just three seconds of iciness before the sharp spicy woodiness takes over. The sharp spicy scent lasts a long time. I sprayed some my clothes and instead of reminding me of warmth associated with foggy New Hampshire mornings, I am thrown hurly burly into the Madrid summer night scene! It took seven hours before the spicy woodiness to abate to let the oceanic scent return (just meekly!).

This is quite an inverted scent. What took front stage is the base note. Once again the spiciness turns me off, gosh it hollers- look I am sophisticated!. The heart note once again made of spicy note – is very unforgiving. Finally, many, many,many hours later, the top notes meekly announces itself- apple, citrus and cucumber. 90% base note. 9% heart note and 1% top note.

By then I am so sick of being reminded of summer that I look forward to a long shower to wash off that scent. If you love summer parties of Ibiza or Tel Aviv- seen and be see crowd this is a great scent but not suitable for the serious winter person who prefer the bleak isolation of Iceland.",08/22/15 00:50,Ice and Snow

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Eternity’s Aqua should not be overlooked – a gem and underrated as a Spring/Summer aquatic fragrance. This one has been on the shelf for a while and I was pleasantly surprised today – the blend of aromatic, aquatic, citrus, and woodsy notes is quite pleasing. I had the “clean” and “fresh” type feeling all day – similar to the feeling when you wake after a storm has passed through the night and you see the sun rising in the early morning hours over the ocean. Clean and renewed – today is going to be a good day..!! There is a remarkable similarity to Polo Blue – I think Blue may have a bit more “umphh” in projection, though. Aqua is sufficiently flexible for any event, generally a crowd pleaser, and modestly priced, adding to the appeal. If there is any criticism of Aqua, it will be in performance – I smell it most of the day, lasting solidly 4+ hours (longer on clothing), but very close to skin level. I am a huge fan of the aquatic fragrances and endorse adding Eternity’s Aqua to your collection. Given the pricing, definitely a must for the younger, novice, or amateur collector. Final tally for Aqua is 4.0 stars out of 5.0 stars and a solid ""like"" for all the ""Fragrantica Following"". Enjoy your day…",04/10/15 14:21,OCNBreeze7

non strabiliante ma neanche una schifezza. è un profumo da stagioni calde, personalmente ho percepito un qualcosa di sintetico nella fragranza, pungeva all'olfatto. ho usato dei campioncini, una volta mi incontrai con un amico che disse ""oh per favore, hai messo un cavolo di profumo americano no?"" la proiezione è molto forte per essere una eau de toilette estiva, non esagerare con gli spray.",01/30/15 06:02,APULIAN
Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Eternity Aqua is one of the nicest smelling Aquatic scent, if not the best. But just for the SMELL, It is without question THE MOST AMAZING & PLEASANT SMELL FOR ME, I use this scent sometime before I go to bed So I can go to sleep with a smile and pleasant thought. But I was going to choose one aquatic for my shelf and current use, and with regret I had to choose Bvlgari Aqva, and the reason is Eternity on my skin does not project after 3/4 hours, when Bvlgari Aqva still going strong as a skin scent. but for the quality of smell, Eternity Aqua is second to none. So Eternity Aqua gets this SPECIAL LOVE from me. It might fade away quick, but when it lives, it smells AMAZING, Scent wise NOT OTHER AQUATIC I FOUND AS PERFECT, FLAWLESS AS THIS. This is just DEVINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YES THIS IS A SMELL TO LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But I am unfortunate it does not last on my skin, but it does last on some peoples skin for very long time. Wish I was one of them, and in the case Eternity Aqua would kick my current and only Aquatic Bvlgari Aqva's butt big time. It is easy to wear, deeply masculine and sexy as a hell. This is only smell I cant stop sniffing. I have some juice left and I am sure as soon as it finishes I will have to replace with a small bottle to wear when I want to smell good and enjoy myself then to think of pleasing others. I am quite sure It will please others too as long as it lived on your skin. I will give it a shot in hot summer days and it Might make the list. as My list of top 15 is all gems I found in my life so far with trial and error with 100s of fragrance, and I FEEL HONOURED TO ADMIT, **ETERNITY AQUA** GOT SPECIAL LOVE AMONG ALL FOR THE SMELL.

It is very great perfume. wow
And for a aquatic it behaves very stylish and not as prominent like other aquatics.
But you won't find any aquatic notes. That is what makes this perfume so special. the notes are very fresh, cucumber, green and citric notes. In the middle the lotus with its typical flowery-soapy like scent opens.
This note is underlined with plum, pepper and lavender. a really great combination that gives that flowery-aromatic scent and that stays to the end.
Sandalwood, patouchili and musk give the finishing touch.

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"The cucumber and lotus here make odd bedfellows and don't really mesh, this comes off a bit too green and synthetic towards the middle and has a high synthetic core to it that undoes all the great things going for this fragrance in regards to excellent performance, longevity, sillage and affordability. The top is great at first, a heavy dose of citrus and cucumber in the vein of Polo Blue but with more power and strength behind it thanks to the heavy dose of synthetic green and aromatic elements. The problem is that the lotus and green synthetics don't mesh well with the cucumber and plum, creating a dissonance that is cloying and abrasive around the 30 minute mark. Projection is mammoth for an aromatic aquatic, easily heavy for most of the way through and longevity is outstanding at over 8 hours consistently after having worn it over the last week, but unfortunately the scent just doesn't blend well and its synthetic core really shows itself quickly and this one never really evolves beyond the top and mid, making for a very linear wear and one that alienates quickly. Amazing performance, best kept for every once in awhile as this is simply too cloying and synthetic for your sinuses for daily wear.",06/07/14 19:23,Blowhard69

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"Update,
What I failed to mention about this fragrance is that it's perfect for daytime casual wear not meant for a sophisticated evening where your wanting to impress someone special. Ck has lighter and fresh notes not a heavier deep aroma like CK Euphoria. After reading the reviews that this frag smells like Polo Blue..I tried out myself and YA big time very similar.

Ck Eternity Aqua has a very aquatic scent mixed with both a light floral/woodsy notes. After it dries dowm I'm able to smell lavender and plum combined with cedar and patchouli which gives this frag a real aromatic aroma.
A lot would appreciate the appealing qualities that comes from this frag which is enjoyable during the spring and summer months without it being offensive to anyone. The frag takes on slightly powdery sweet scent which is from musk giving it a really appealing fragrance.
Longevity and Silage are both very good...
Overall though,
I know that a lot of people consider this collections for a much longer age group. I would agree that CK is trying to go after the age group that's from 20-30yrs old which wants a freshness and aromatic scent which this one has. Thou I'm not in that age group I'm still able to enjoy this fragrance just like a lot are able to.

Eternity Aqua for Men Calvin Klein,"This is a really well formulated aquatic fragrance surprisingly without sea or water accords. I could smell citruses right after I unboxed it, a bit harsh in my opinion. Not sure why but I don't smell cucumber at all, I can't say there isn't, but I guess gets mixed up with the plum. Try Abercrombie & Fitch Cologne 41 which opens up to a predominantly cucumber burst (it's almost like I rub a freshly cut cucumber on my skin and then smelling off it)
What I do sense is cool green notes that evolves after the opening fades away (ten minutes?), followed by hints of lavender and musk.

Reminds me of Bvlgari Aqva + Davidoff Cool Water + a spicy fragrance, all rolled into one.
I can't agree more, it smells just like RL Polo Blue, not the opening so much because Polo Blue opens with Melon (but dissipates quickly) and CK Eternity Aqua opens with citruses and plum.

It was a blind buy based on reviews here and I don't regret it.
It suits best for a lunch date, preferably at an open air restaurant facing a sea or a lush green lawn.

It doesn't smell like ""happiness"" it's smells as the description sentence,
the in between hope [of achieving something that will bring happiness] and reaching it.

It starts airy [hopeful] fresh, then there's some strange note in the middle and then ends in a linear softness but not musk or vanilla, but like air that ends, like a breeze soft feeling

Would I wear it? No
I am not walking ""euphoria"" .... it's not a happy fragrance, it's not bad,
its unique but not sexy or femenine, it kind leaves you scratching your head, do I or not like it?
It definitely has personality. That I like.

Would I buy it? YES
for aromatheraphy, for the artistic smell behind it, for inspiration or perhaps wear it in a very particular occassion.

It almost is like a crystal clear, light hearted version of moschino by moschino sans the heavier orientalism - thats not a negative for moschino, moschino is truly wonderful (and not necessarily heavy).

Apart from that it is fruity sweet and nice smelling more like a deo spray but with a nice quite good quality vibe and sophistication as well thought it smelled a little grapey.
I haven't smelt the Edp but i think that one would be better that this, would last longer and maybe would have a better smell, less diluted.

On the other hand, Euphoria EDT would be a nice and safe fragrance gift for a woman who likes fruity florals, and the bottle is lovely.

Also can't wait for the new Deep Euphoria to be launched in Fall",05/11/16 10:48,auroramaria
Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,"Perfectly beautiful orchid/lotus fragrance but I thought I was getting the EDP which smells entirely different. So now I have a full 1.7oz still in box for trade.

Anyone in the States care to swap? Peruse my ""had"" folder and let's make a deal! :)",11/03/15 15:40,shell_bell
Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,"I have never ever liked a single Calvin Klein fragrance. Ever. Until now! I actually like this! I will admit I've had a feeling about Euphoria for a while now. The shape of the bottle and the color of the juice. One day, while at Marshalls, I even caught a whiff of the body spray version and that is what kept my interest going. Then last night I decided to order a sample to once and for all make a decision and put the secret question to rest. I spent time reading reviews for all of the flankers and the original and ordered a 1/2 ounce of the EDP and samples of this. Well wouldn't you know, with some free time this evening, I went to TJMaxx and saw this little beauty sitting there tempting me! So I caved and bought it blind despite having a sample on its way to me as I write this.
I already had my day fume on but it was slowly fading so I figured it would work to spray on the other side of my wrist. I was immediately convinced I had finally found a CK scent for me! The woodsy notes are what win me over. I think CK spices are what I dislike (read- hate) so this is in the clear on that front. Orchid, Sandalwood and Amber along with a touch of green notes are what come together on my skin. I feel like I know this combination but I can't put my finger on it. I can't believe I'm saying this but on me, it's almost a cousin to Coco Mademoiselle! There is something very strong, not in the aroma but the feeling or emotion. It is the scent of a woman who is sure of herself and is ready to take on the world. It isn't sweet but strong, crisp and defined. I really like it a lot. And I can't wait to try the EDP for comparison because I hear it is sweet. I think having both with be great!
I was quite shocked at this scent. Shocked at how I could like a Calvin Klein. Shocked at how different it seems to be on me than on others based on reviews. Shocked at how different it seems to be from what I'm guessing the EDP will be like. Overall, I'm shocked in a really good way! I am glad I finally gave it a shot. Sometimes it pays to be less snobby than I was being ;-)",09/19/15 19:55,Hipchick40

Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,"This is a much, much softer version on the EDP. It is citrusy, airy and very powdery. I know EDTs have limited longevity but this disappears from my skin in 15-20 minutes. And I mean completely gone, I can't detect it at all.
Even if I layer it with another perfume CK Euphoria EDT will disappear completely leaving behind the other scent. I bought this blind but I wish I had tested it first. The EDP is such a power house so I assumed the EDT would have some lasting power. Bummer, lesson learnt....",06/09/14 00:05,cmeeme

Quite frankly, between ""Euphoria"" and Halle Berry's ""Pure Orchid"" the latter wins in my book as a fantastic scent.

Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,"Euphoria EDT is definitely my type of a floral composition. It is a green and bright floral. It starts with orchid and lotus accompanied with a gentle sandalwood. I find it sparkling and light, not powdery at all. Longevity is just right for an EDT, I would say about 3 hours on skin and a little more on clothes. It is very refreshing, just like a sip of water from a frosty glass, I will enjoy it much in scorching summer months.",07/24/13 06:07,kakaka2
Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,"Now.... there is no way that i could talk bad about this perfume because i love its cousin =p

I have been a true Euphoria addict for many years and have had my share of bottles so there is no turning back now. LOL

As for this perfume...i got it as a gift and it was a mix up because they intended to purchase the perfume instead of the edt =p Oh well i made the best of it! =p

To me it smelled like a watered down and more delicate flowery version of the original. The base notes are tamed in this one. A bit more shy... like u would want to wear the edp but u feel its 2 strong for u...that's the only way i can see this working.

Still... not bad... at all! =)

Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,"This is now sadly on my ""had"" list due to dropping and smashing an entire 100ml bottle on a hard floor :(

I really enjoyed this one and preferred it to the EDP which I found too woody for my liking and it had some sort of coffee smell to it.

Stayed on clothes well(I used a jumper to mop up as much as poss so i could it enjoy it for as long as poss) but it disappeared from my skin by lunch time. (hence why i got a huge bottle in the first place to spray lavishly!!)

GUTTED!!",04/08/13 14:20,xclairabellax
Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,I like it so so much. Feminine and mystical. Not too heavy not too sweet and spicy. I hate spicy scents because they can be very heavy on my skin.

Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,"At first I loved it...It's quite an addictive fragrance. I have owned it but just couldn't stand it after a while...
Something strange happens to it when worn by some people or maybe it just gets old. It smells of a damp cloth that's been damp for too long...if you know what I mean...Sort of like a trash bin smell...I know it sounds awful but it's true. Maybe it's just the way I perceive it.",02/09/13 04:03,mizzflowerpot

It reminds me a bit of JAdore. Same type of classy scent.",12/19/12 12:26,genny17
Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,"Ah, I can't believe it! Apparently the cold weather had affected my Euphoria somehow, and it took a few weeks for the scent to settle back to original.

Now it smells just like I remembered, and I'm wholly bewitched by this beauty. It's incredibly silky and a bit juicy, I can almost feel the milky consistency in my nostrils. Yeah, it's pretty much orchid and lotus in milky water, breathtaking in a subtle way.

It's both aristocratic and charming. I know now what I'll be wearing in spring.",12/04/12 06:49,alicepolice

Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,This little sister is even more beautiful. It lacks that sticky sweet note which comes out from time to time in the original Euphoria. Only the most beautiful notes have stayed here and it is georgeus. So light but misterious. Orchid still plays the main role with the woody note. I've got to have it. I don't desire its bigger sister anymore. I desire Euphoria EDT. The lasting power is great.,05/24/12 07:35,emi
Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,"AAAMAZING!! One of my favorites for summer. (While Euphoria edp is one of my favorites for winter and going out).
It's fresh, fruity, a little sweet and has that special sexy fresh woodyness that lasts and lingers. It's sexy and feminine, without being too young, but it is not an 'old' perfume either by any means!
It would make a great all year around signature fragrance. I love it very much and think it is the best out of all the Euphoria flankers (yes also much better than forbidden euphoria).

Go get it!",01/12/12 15:41,tinaelisa
Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,"Finally I tried this one today.. And I´m sad I haven´t tried before, If I knew It was so simmilar as the edp but lighter, I would go buy this one instead of euphoria forbidden..

Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,"To tell you the truth, I am not very keen on orientals but I got this one in 30ml just to keep it in my bag when i go to the beach as it is sweet but not too intoxicating. The price was reduced and I decided why not. It has a peachy openning with a little sour which I guess is coming from an apple. The peach note remained for as long as the scent lasted on skin and then somehow my nose detected lilly of the valley. This mixture remained on skin for about 2 hours and then just flew off. Overall, the scent is very-very plain. However, it totally suits the purpose and the price.",11/12/10 06:20,KATeriCOS

Eternity For Men Summer 2009 Calvin Klein,"I am a HUGE fan of all things cK and his summer fragrances are no exception, I am typing this on the summer solstice and am in fact wearing this and enjoying it as I type this...

I got '07 ES men first and (stupidly) skipped the much ballyhooed '08 ES men so when I read the notes in the press release I was not gonna let this one get away. I actually found it at TJ Maxx before the end of last summer for 20 USD (SCORE!)...

This one begins like a cool evening cocktail with a faint bitter note of bergamot as it saunters into a robust heart of spicy pepper and fresh basil with a gentle touch of chamomile to keep it from getting too out of line from that cocktail. The drydown is unique for cK because it isn't the formulaic patchouli, sandalwood, musk+ fizzle...no,no, this cool customer finishes you off with a not-to-orintal White amber, some anise (usually found in the top or heart), and slumps you down in the shade of the cool light green nuances of the hinoki wood...aah

Sillage: moderate
Longevity: 8 hrs and still on skin
Overall: 4.0/5

I have found ultra-lite and summer frags work on my skin better if I apply generously before dressing then reapply again before I go out...this helps blend the levels and strengthen the longevity.",06/21/10 17:06,gypsy parfumista

Eternity For Men Summer 2009 Calvin Klein,"hmm... my reflections:

-definitely there are some notes in this scent (also in previous version) that makes me sick and even sometimes terrible headache.
i don't like synthetic scents and this one is surely that kind.
in spite of those facts i bought it. i even strongly enjoy wearing this fragrance in particular days.

-it's typical ""showy"" fragrance (variation of aqua di gio). good for clubbing all night long. for sure fun lovin' girls will notice you. they will think that you smell good and quite rich.
i don't like this kind of lifestyle and perfume. for me it's symptom of shallow personality... but several days during year i put those kind of fragrance on me and go to spend crazy night in club or disco.

do i have schizopherania???
- i don't think so...
- me neither

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Weirdo vanilla--which I appreciate. But I can't decide if I like this or just think it's ok. Spicy and a nice note of Angelica and bitter orange. Vanilla and sandalwood show up fast for me. Gardenia mostly for the floral. Not really thinking ""delicious thrills"" as stated in the copy for their original promo.
Could possibly be unisex, but I think it's more feminine.
Herbaceous and a little cool-spicy yet warm with the amber/vanilla/tonka.
A little sweet, but still mostly in an herbaceous way. Powdery. Dries sweeter on me than the beginning. Keeping it because I want to figure it out some more.

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Woods, vanilla, powder and musk. As already mentioned by others this bears no resemblance to original Obsession. Not warm amber or chilly musk. Neutral. The powder, musk & cashmere wood make it soft and fluffy. I'm wearing this in hot weather during the day and perfectly happy with day wear.

The dry down is similar to Guess Gold minus fruit and more powdery. Longevity is the same.

Obsession Night has moderate sillage for the first 2-3 hours then falls off a cliff into a skin scent. The good news is it lasts on skin for most of the day but no one else will be able to smell it unless they are very close.

I don't get the citrus or anything to give it a bit of twang.

It's ok, it's nice, but oh so plain. I sprayed it, sniffed, and it was...flat! It did absolutely nothing for me, no reaction at all. Where are all the emotions, never mind if good or bad, a good perfume brings out in you? Original Obsession is in my top 5, but this one is just not in the same class, they have nothing in common, this one has no personality at all. Anyway, a unisex, bergamot and orange and mybe some sandalwood are what I get most, it's citrusy but a bit warmer than, for example, CK One, though sillage and longevity are quite similar. Nothing special about this one, again, I can't believe it's an Obsession flanker, they're like yin and yang, like a live person vs... robot?",02/17/23 02:20,doya
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I’ve scoured the comments and no one has said this so I’m probably alone in thinking this but: Rhubarb and custard, that’s what I get!
I think it must be the Angelica and the vanilla but seriously i get strong rhubarb.
I’m now wondering if this is just something the Brits will get as no other nation seem to have such ridiculous flavours as we do lol",01/12/23 12:44,Lipsticksuzie
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Very light and unisex scent, doesn't project much but has its place in my collection as a nice skin scent and lasts well over 9 hours on my clothes. Contrary to its name, it is well-suited for daytime and even the office as it's non-offensive. Yes it kind of resembles a clean, aftershave scent, and leans a bit to the masc side. It has absolutely nothing to do with the original Obsession, and I actually prefer Night so much more. This scent is pretty linear so I wouldn't call it interesting or unique - it's a basic citrus and white floral. But the vanilla and cashmere wood come out hours later in the drydown and make it a bit cozier. This fragrance would pair so nicely with a white cotton button down shirt.",11/03/22 18:21,kittywhiskers
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Бях го забравила дълго време, днес реших да го понося и се радвам, че не го разкарах. Купих го покрай любовта ми към obsession, с който няма нищо общо, може би затова го позабравих. Акварелен, но плътен аромат, нотките се преливат една в друга, зелен и топъл едновременно, много траен за моя нос. Унисекс.",10/10/22 12:42,ivadim

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I feel like the best CK fragrances are those that are very simple and clean. When CK tries to do something different (with the exception of the masterpiece Obsession and CK’s shocking floriental Euphoria), things are just weird, unnecessarily complicated, and seem like maybe an unfinished experiment or something? I feel this way about Obsession Night. From an air/blotter spray at first I didn’t like this at all. There were no distinctive notes. Then I sprayed on my wrist to see if it changed. Much later, something mildly aquatic/ floral floated up from my wrist drew me in for more. According to notes on the idea behind this fragrance, the scent is supposed to evoke blooming night flowers in the moonlight. The jasmine and woods are very soft and go well together, creating an odd sense of freshness that I guess eventually achieves the objective, but it’s really only very far into the dry down. It would have been nice if it unfolded like a story, as so many other great scents do. Unfortunately, the opening just smells of alcohol and synthetic florals. As a CK fan, I just bought a bunch of CK fragrances I’ve never tried, including this one. I really wanted to like this but it will stay on the shelf for awhile.",02/24/22 23:33,chyan
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I really enjoy this fragrance & I get Earl Grey Tea with Bergamot & an extra dose of Sweet Lemon added to it, even though no tea notes are listed. Comforting when you want an easy going scent bubble. It lasts for 6+ hours, but I wish it was deeper or had stronger presence.

Updated edit: I have been also using this fragrance in the high heat of summer & it's a nice lemony citrus fragrance to take my mind off of the heat & also has a slightly sweet mint scent to it as well. It's a very nice tea scent. I sometimes wonder how this compares to other tea scents. I keep also hearing about Still by Jennifer Lopez as a very nice tea scent as well. My bottle of Obsession Night was purchased online & is a current version. I sampled this a few years ago prior to my purchased bottle & the previous one had more floral aspects & more depth compared to the bottle that I have.

I also think that Calvin Klein must have had some sense of humor when they put Obsession Night as the name for this very daytime kind of scent. & Conversely, naming Obsession with the deeper scent should have been named as an evening/nighttime scent.",02/10/22 05:32,shenamedel
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Obsession Night is a keeper. This is such a stunning Amber floral! Smells a lot like shaving cream at first spray, however after settling into the skin for a few minutes, you are really greeted with the white floral notes - Jasmine and Gardenia I pick up the most. The base notes blend so beautifully together and make for a stunning dry down. It actually reminds me a little bit of how Alien wears on my skin. So glad I purchased this - what an underrated fragrance!",01/03/22 14:57,moonsunstars
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Another Marshall’s blind buy success! $24.99 for a 3.4oz bottle and such a great value.
It starts off very shaving cream as others have mentioned but mellows out to a solidly unisex creamy vanilla musk. I definitely get the citrus but not so much the florals. It’s just a perfect daytime scent. I don’t typically dig Calvin Klein perfumes. Reveal and now Obsession Night are my two faves.
Yay!",12/30/21 20:48,miriamcarothers
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Gorgeous. Soft and sweet, maybe even creamy. Interesting with the bitterish orange and herbal angelica. It whispers “hey let’s chill…”
My brain says: Sweet vanilla flowers and cucumber? I love this. It’s like slipping on your softest, warmest long sleeve shirt and jeans when it’s a bit chilly. I’d call this a cool vanilla because of the green note. So approachable and crowd-pleasing.
That cashmeran note I guess is what turns this into a cuddly vibe. I don’t know how to describe it but it works. Lately I think of this as my year rounder signature (if I had one!)
Definitely my top reached for over the seasons…
The whole composition reads to me as soft, sweet, with an interesting herby green twist. Leans unisex because of that element. I feel confident to wear this day or night, all occasions. It lasts around 5 hours on me then is detectable only if I have some on my shirt. I want to have this as a staple. It keeps my nose happy. It doesn’t remind me of the older Obsession. She deserves an original name!",12/04/21 06:02,Sparkleball22
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I find this perfume to be more of a Citrus Floral type. I mostly smell the Bitter Orange and Lily of the Valley and something else which I assume is the Angelica note. Only after 3 hours, the Citrus Floral scent goes away and a woody, smoky scent replaces it. The woody scent is subtle and sticks to the skin.

I find the perfume to be unisexual. I see this fragrance being worn by businesswomen. That being said, it may not be suitable for the office. The woody scent can be alluring and sexy. This scent is more suitable for casual events. I also think this scent will be good to wear on certain games or sports like pool or golf.

Anyway, longevity is 3-6 hours. I think this scent can be worn on all season. Night time seems more suitable but I think it can be worn on the day as well.",09/29/21 20:18,berrycool1211
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I don't understand how this is considered a ""Night"" fragrance. I was expecting something darker, deeper.
This shocked me at first. I felt so disappointed.
I bought the entire bottle and it felt like a waste.
However...
I wore it during the day. I wore it at work. I wore it doing errands. I realized I actually quite like it. The vanilla and cashmere just work for my skin. It's softer than it's sibling Obsession. Like, this one is the angelic sibling that seems to be discarded for the ostentatious elder sibling. I have never really been a fan of white floral but I am a fan of this one. She's really quite special. The Lily and Rose just bring her out with this divine drydown.
This is a cozy stay-at-home date fragrance and it's perfect for everyday wear. I love it.
Please don't expect a spicy perfume when purchasing her. Expect something softer and sweeter, you'll probably see her in a better light.",09/02/21 15:36,AphroditeLeStrange
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I actually prefer this one to the male version ,I ran through 2 bottles before I knew it was the one for ladies,quite unisex , slightly aquatic, gently floral with mild spicyness.Even though the Masculine version smells like a more muted TF Black Orchid.( btw this came out first so TF may have copied & improved on It🤷🏾♂️)Perfect for Summer Evenings..A love at first sniff and the drydown is divine.",08/30/21 21:06,keoncharles27
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"A classic. I believe me and my girls together used up around 15 bottles of it. I myself finished 4 of them for sure. Balsamic, fragrant. stimulating and lots intriguing. Love the spice dominance and all of the dry down. Lasts forever on clothes hanging in the foyer and stays on your skin after shower sometimes.

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I love this! My husband got me a 3.4 oz bottle for $25 at the drugstore today! The opening is sharp, balsamic/ sour sweet with a fairly short descent into a musky sweet vanilla. The dichotomy in the notes that others describe as fighting , are an adventure to me, the same way I love the spicy sweet stomach calming original. This is a steal and a blind buy for me. Great for the summer, this also gives a nod to aquatic scents. For a little extra sexy, I added Prada iris to my hairline and core",06/18/21 23:01,s2jkbrad

1 it has a very masculine opening, hinting at shaving foam scent

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I officially tested this perfume every day for 3 weeks, after it had a long waiting in my closet.
The heart of this perfume is 1:1 with So De la Renta by Oscar de la Renta and the opening is very similar with the opening from the Italian house Manilla G from the Eau the Fraiche, very citrus, the bitter orange is very pronounce but for me is a good thing. The middle is floral but in a easy way, acvatic, I don't feel the masculine vibe everyone speaks about, but of course I think a true gentleman can wear it, but it isn't harsh like in the masculine vibe CK one have. The final note is very charming, amber but a powdery not sweat one. Over all I like it, it not a night perfume,that coming for me trust me means a lot 😂 because I can't stand a powerful perfume worn on day, still this is very suitable for day. I don't know why the others find the classic Obsession good, but hey it's very oriental and suffocating so I can relate but still this one is very good for my taste.",09/30/20 11:29,Amy Ann
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"When I 1st tried this, it smelled more masculine on me. It was an ok scent, but just wasn't ""pretty"". This was a body chemistry thing, and I tried it again when that changed (with change in diet, etc), and now I get SWEEET VANILLA out of it. It smells way more feminine now, but with that dark mysterious base, which can still get a bit like a man's cologne, but the sweet powdery citrusy vanilla takes center stage. So I like it now.


Given the name, and the masculine notes, it made me think of, like, a Lifetime movie where some obsessed stalker woman sneaks into her object-of-desire's house at night while he is not there, and she puts on his work shirt smelling of his cologne 😭😭😵",08/28/20 06:00,Anjolena
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"That ""cashmere"" wood spoils the whole composition, Cashmer does nothing but propel the musk with an intense amber shade. It is a ""night"" perfume because it's calamitous uncontrolled sweat fragrance.
Update: well I need to apologize to this Blue soul here, I didn't treat it fairly. Last night I had white sleep that practically mean that I can sleep so I go to my perfume showcase with the idea of perfuming myself with something cold aromatic that would relax me so much that I finally fall asleep I ended up sitting in front of the closet for 3 hours smelling and arranging perfumes.....
Between my perfumes, I find this bottle her sister Obsession and her cousin Moschino, some time ago I read about Moschino in a perfume blog and the author, a man, write about how Moschino is a perfume and successful woman perfume, well I see it oriental and I was sceptical but curious after some weeks I call my perfume gallery I speak with my consultant for 6 years already and beg him to order a bottle for me, he told me "" madame Amy you will not like it isn't a powerful woman perfume, it's a black oriental, not cold not vertical, isn't suitable for you"" Of course I insisted and after all he order it. Reading about that perfume I seen that people compare him with Obsession so sure that I would love it I order that too, ignoring my consultant, poor him he tried to explain me in vain, I said : I want that perfume Javier, but madam Amy.., no but!😂 I m a little viper...who I lie, I m a huge one.
Anyway when I go to take my perfumes, Javier insisted to test first I refused and after propose me this perfume he told me that Obsession Night is a cold oriental and it's more suitable for a powerful business woman like me, I was in a hurry because of a meeting so I take all 3 and go. When I arrived home that evening I open my box and put all three bottles on my living room table. I spray Moschino first....ahch who said that a powerful woman perfume never seen a powerful woman before, never but never a powerful woman would wear outside such a hot perfume, we wear cold, distinguished perfume, who vibrance the power of the person it touch. Disappointed and swearing that I will never trust a man who I don't know speaking about woman power, I sprayed the Obsession ichhhh the same feeling maybe more likable because it's was at least close to the skin because Moschino was practically everyone perfume doesn't count who spray it that fragrantice would go everywhere. The last and very disappointed I spray this blue bottle and I thought it was so sweat and so overwhelmed and nothing powerful in it. I put them in the back of my showcase and live it there. But last night I was curious and sprayed this again before trying the other two... splendiferous, I don't feel the oriental for it, it's a spicy citrus with something floral I have feeling who remember me of my lovely Perle Verte, loving it. It's cold, aromatic not really hard, it's concentrated it's true but not overwhelmed. I don't see this like a night perfume, I see it like an everyday, maybe not in summer ...still I don't think it would be a problem to wear it in summer time to, but anyway for a powerful woman is a suitable cold concentrated perfume beautiful to be put on a vintage Escada suit and to go with it to the office. The other two...no, no I tried it again still hate it but this....my apologies blue bottle you are a friend for a powerful woman I'm sorry I neglected you dear.",08/20/20 10:24,Amy Ann
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"No offence to anybody that likes this but I HATE it. I can't think of any perfume I've disliked as much as this one.
My nose can pick out the notes I like, the citrus, the gardinia and vanilla, but it's like they are swimming in this soup of weirdness that tugs my brain all over the place. The notes seem to bounce off each other instead of blending together, like a child banging on piano keys vs someone playing a song.
There is a note that my nose just can't stand, and don't recognize, perhaps the labdanum, which I'm not familiar with, but what bothers me most is the sense of chaos and competition the notes give off, like they're all fighting to be on top.
For me, perfume is all about aromatherapy. This fragrance makes me feel agitated and stressed out, not what I'm looking for.
I would not suggest a blind buy on this one.
I enjoy reading the positive reviews and am always astounded by differences of opinion regarding fragrance. It's always good to see the other perpesctive.",08/19/20 19:35,ansabrew
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"This is the perfume that made me fall in love with perfumes. It probably holds more sentimental value for me now than anything else but I still enjoy it very much.
It must have been 2005 and I was very young and it was the first and only time I asked a stranger what scent they were wearing. I didn't only ask, I had to get off on an earlier stop from the bus and I had to chase this poor person down a steep hill, almost breaking my legs in the process.
I still remember that it was a warm evening and how the air smelled and how impressed I was with this magical scent.
Did they tell me? Yes,they said ""Blue Calvin Klein"". And being myself I immediately forgot what I heard. I spent 15 years trying to find it, trying all the blue bottles I could find. And only recently I did find this one last year and although I know it doesn't smell exactly like it used to be I am happy to have it.
So why did I fall in love with it? It wasn't a very feminine scent and I enjoyed the masculine notes so much. It felt like someone just met their boyfriend and after a long ""hug"" their perfumes mixed and it developed into this amazing blend. So the masculine notes must be the citrus but I usually hate citrus so why would I love this? I can't smell vanilla here either and I usually love any hint of vanilla so this again is strange. I get the hint of sweetness but definitely not in a gourmand sort of way. I get some white flowers but again I used to hate anything with white flowers. This is definitely one that is more than just a sum of its parts.
This scent felt very adult and mysterious to me, and confident and sexy. Now it feels safe for the office, ok for summer but also great for a blind date. It feels too safe for me now to love it as much as I did but I know I will always have a bottle. Maybe it is like meeting an old flame after many, many years, you can see why you fell in love with them but all of the excitement is gone.",08/06/20 08:36,Alice Greenfingers
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"When I was a teenager I'd have the boys I dated take me outside the city to stargaze. This is totally the scent I would have worn those decades ago had it been available. It's not the field or the stars or the boys or anything other than the darkness between the stars; the mystery how lives were to unfold. It has that depth and anticipation inside of it, one that seems to come with dreamy youth.

I love the way this fragrance unfolds: bitter and sweet, morphing into a well blended humid, woody, out-doorsy vanilla. It's the promise of excitement and the realisation that maybe excitement is nice, but what we really want is something more traditional to anchor us down when we watch the stars.",07/06/20 04:38,brightflashes
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"As far as I am concerned, this is an underrated gem. I suppose it depends on the memories this smell evokes. Does anyone else smell sharpened pencil shavings in the opening? Obsession Night dries down ... a long time later ... to a lovely, soft, baby oil type vanilla. I am wearing this for comfort during the coronavirus outbreak and I just love it. I have owned this bottle for at least 12 years and the juice is still good, by the way. Please stay safe and well, everyone.",03/27/20 12:31,Waterqueene
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,The opening feels like a fight between sour citrus and flowers. There is a strange bitter tarry smell under it all the pokes through again and again each time I smell my wrist. It chills out to a *very* nice vanilla with flowers.

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I smell cumin in here for sure -- nasty; like something else I hated and sold; sweet, bitter, sweaty like caramel mixed with salt and crushed flowers and baby vomit, a sourness to it and a mishmash of mishap; vanilla, sandalwood, cashmere, bitter orange and orange, angelica, some light white flowers, ick. Seems a cold weather frag. I am wearing it in June but it's only in the 70s. Maybe I will try it again this fall. Gets a little better as it dries down. I hated the top.",06/25/19 18:23,gtabasso

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"The review below by Shellapoo is excellent. Most of what they said is how I feel about this scent. It took me a couple tries to come around on this one, but when I did, I was really happy that I added it to my arsenal. It's such a hard fragrance to categorize. Klein's use of the term ""night"" to this obsession isn't totally a sell for me. It encaptures so many different nuances and they are so blended seamlessly that one cannot only have one thought if it. The opening citruses and florals complement each other perfectly. Neither being too forward, but each mixing together in just the right amount. The dry down allows the tonka, vanilla, and amber to underpin the top to give this it's luxurious creaminess. It's such a perfect harmonious blend of citrus, floral, and cream. Each being perfectly proportionate without making the fragrance overly gourmand, floral, or fruity.The strength doesn't quite reach EDP status even though my bottle is the EDP. And it definitely doesn't have the POWER that its Mother, Obsession, has. This scent is very different from Mother Obsession. And it's definitely adaptable for day or night wear. Night wear would require just an extra spritz or 2, and you're good to go. I encourage you to try this. It's beautiful.",03/22/19 11:00,odorenasum
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I have recently re-tried several perfumes that I had previously written off as being bad mixes with my chemistry. Most of them have been what I would describe as spicy scents, and those heavy on woods and amber, with very little florals, fruits, or green notes. One of these was Obsession. I don't know why I thought I hated it - I LOVE it! Once I discovered how much I love Obsession, I took the plunge and blind bought this beauty. I didn't know what to expect, but now I can say it is a treasure! I smell some similarity to Obsession, but enough of a difference that I will be keeping BOTH of them in my collection forever. This is such a well blended scent that I can't seem to identify individual notes too well. I can say, however, that it is gorgeous. On my skin, it is beautiful but not overly strong. I'm not going to save this one for night. Even though it is somewhat potent (never potent enough for me though!), I think it is safe for the office as long as you are light with the spritzing. I wouldn't describe this as a floral, yet there are enough florals to notice and enjoy. I definitely wouldn't say it is an aquatic, yet there is a hint of ""blue"" in there. I think I would call this spicy, although it is not in the same league as the strong spice of Obsession. Whenever I've stepped out of the shower and dressed in the morning, I spray this on and I immediately get a ""mood lift"" and get the feeling that today is going to be a very good day. Who doesn't need that in their daily life?",03/19/19 12:33,shellapoo
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Certainly it's been reformulated over the last 13-14 years since being introduced in 2005. I'm fortunate enough to have a bottle from 2006... So I suspect I have an original formulation in my possession...The juice has even taken on an aged patina within the blue bottle. I wouldn't risk ordering a new one to compare, for fear of complete disappointment.

I find it a good cold weather scent, with average longevity. I don't mind wearing it anytime- day or night.

I will be doing my best to use as much as i can before this beauty spoils. No telling how much longer it will keep.

Really reminds me of Coty Dark Vanilla... very much so. Probably the jasmine, and vanilla. Plan to test one on each wrist to see how they compare. Ive been searching for a Dark Vanilla dupe for years, and this is as close as I've come yet.",03/14/19 20:12,Waldina80
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I was hesitant to buy this fragrance because the reviews are all over the place. Saw it on sale for a great price so I went for it. Glad I did because I love it. I don’t find it masculine but the florals are very subtle so perhaps that’s why some reviewers find it to be masculine. It’s not a night scent to me but a beautiful soft bergamot , amber, musk and powdery vanilla.",02/03/19 09:33,Jobob
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I just got this today and with the 1st testing, I feel it leans quite masculine , giving me a sense of dejavu as it is quite generic,leaving me to think it is a cheap cologne, which is a shame.

I admit, I was hoping for something much darker but instead it is almost entirely aquatic in the opening which again is slightly disappointing as I adore original Obsession, which incidently, this flanker bears no resemblance too.

I honestly felt with this composition, that the addition of incense, spices or vanilla could really amp this up a little and make it something special.

So until further testings, I would safely say that this scent isnt especially noir or night, so it is safe for daytime wearing to the office etc and it does have decent lasting power with moderate perfomance.. Which isn't bad for the price and amount per bottle. And I'm hoping that in warmer weather, the scent might open up a little, into something entirely different to what it is now.",11/29/18 15:14,amanda-m-lewis
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I just got a big 100ml bottle at very reasonable price and instantly opened and sprayed. Now this bottle is made by Coty - I saw some negative comments bashing this edition - and I must say there is defo a bit of truth in there..It says eau de parfum, but I`d rather classify it as an eau de toilette, although it did last good 4 hours on me..Given that the scent itself is not as strong in nature as the original Obsession basically one shouldn`t expect miracles here anyway.

The scent itself is quite a surprise. It isn`t really something you`d expect..I`m not a fan of the original Obsession, although it definitely is a powder-bomb powerhouse scent, just too much for me, always was..Love to take a whiff, but don`t like it on me. Whereas this one is more wearable - initially waaaaay too citrusy for my liking, but that impression fades quick enough and it slowly dries down to be this lovely cashmere-vanilla-flower beauty. I get mainly these three notes and something fruity also even though there aren`t any fruity notes listed apart from bitter orange..To my nose this note is slightly like PAPAYA! It is definitely there though, I much more get this than a lot of the other scents, now I do not know what angelica smells like, so it could also be the impression of that - but to me it is papaya, and that is that..But cashmere, vanilla and flowers are defo out there more than anything else, there is almost a milkiness to it also which makes it easy to wear.

I like it because the drydown is not typical, not a mass-produced one, it would almost pass as unisex too, but still more on the feminine side. Elegant! I love the cashmere note particularly and it is paired well with flowers here.

It is possibly an all-year-rounder, but not typically for night or for colder months. I recommend trying if you don`t want anything sweet, heavy or very citric. Thumbs up from me.

EDIT: I just sprayed it on cca 3 hours ago, and now I`m sniffing it closely. The drydown actually does hold abit of similarity with the original Obsession! After all the citrus and white flowers gone comes the cashmeran wood, then musk and then this..very similar..don`t know what note it is, but similar. It is interesting noticing this..I sprayed the original - my Mum`s bottle - on my skin a few days ago and it just hit me..",10/12/18 16:26,meliecat
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"This is so weird. Absolutely not what I was expecting. Given the original Obsession, and the ""night"" claim, this is a simple, safe, aquatic scent that is more like ""day"" or ""sun"" or ""beach"" or ""summer."" It is nice, but I'm not sure I need a bottle of ""nice."" But again, I'll use up my decant and update if my opinion changes.",09/24/18 09:48,ptilda
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"The only thing Obsession and Obsession Night have in common is the sweet green herbal note that the current formulation of Obsession has. Obsession Night otherwise goes a more floral, musky route and has little staying power. I had to really overspray this one for it to last even just a couple of hours. It's a shame because I actually really enjoy this scent; without the herbal note it could be a generic woody floral but the green aspect really turns this fragrance into something unique.

Obsession is known for being a powerhouse fragrance, why oh why could they not make Night just as strong??",06/10/18 14:53,greyhoundmom
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I wrote below once and I will write again, 6 years later, that this is an incredible perfume. Maybe it's because I love perfumes from the 90s and 00's. They were less contrived, so to speak. Most perfumes I smell in shops today are way too in your face, they lack simplicity and sincerity. I go 'yuck' almost every time I sniff another bottle at the mall, so I stopped doing it. Out of 100, I will like 1-2.

Obsession Night, however, is still that very oldie. Along with everything Biagiotti does. Along with some Paul Smith. I just ordered three CC and one Biagiotti, opened Obsession Night and went WOW. I have missed this terribly. The last bottle I had was of poor quality.

But now, oh, I'm in heaven. And I really don't know whether it's masculine or not. To be honest, I don't care. This scent is just... WOW.",05/18/18 16:29,Lotto.Lupus
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"The notes in this are kind of a strange combination. Usually citrus and huge florientals are opposites, but they coexist here. The clean aspect screams yOU BEHAVE! while the voluptuous aspect whispers hey come here i’m Here. Great for occasions where you are not sure if you want to scare off your guests or entice them.... i still don’t know if i hate it or love it",01/14/18 09:35,chinook
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I did like this when I bought it but after wearing it for some time, honestly it's a perfume that smells like laundry detergent.",08/14/17 02:11,Nina1999
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"This perfume is just enchanting. Floating buttery floral sweetness and smooth cashmere that reminds me of liquid amber, with a tiny edge of bitter citrus and herbs to keep it interesting. First 2 minutes are bitter orange and angelica herbal bite. Makes you believe this might be a challenge.

But then she just folds out the sweet, liquidy woods and white flowers. I usually like fragrances with gardenia and white flowers in a supporting role, and here they play beautifully with the woods and cashmere to create a luxurious, sweet and deep smell.
I can see why it's called Night, it could be very sexy. I think it's sheer enough for daytime, too. It's sillage is not too out there. Longevity around 4-5 hrs.
Mmmmmm-I love this one.
P. S. So sad I think mine has turned. I hope I can find some newer stuff out there!",07/25/17 07:27,Erinbath22
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,GOOD GOD I lovvve' this so much. I'm a guy but this is just magical and mysterious on my skin like a dream. Bad news first: it doesn't last.. and guess what? I don't care! Just keep spraying it! I don't care if fragrance last. But make sure u get big bottle. So anyways this is the first fragrance that I ever sprayed and was like this is 'ME.' I bought it thinking it was the men's but turned out it was woman perfume and i am a man! Since then I have bought all obsession flankers (summer) both men and women's except the men's night version. They are all beautiful. I believe Dior could trick people put his name on obsession woman night and market it toward men and it will be just as good as Dior Homme Eau! I rather have this for $20 then spend a $100 on men's Dior Homme Eau! Creamy dreamy night aquatic subtle compact powder musk. I recommend this to men. I love love and am dying for another bottle when I can find it for $20 I'm going for it. And I love the bottle...a beautiful blue color just so me I like it over all my colognes! Sorry ladies this one is for me!,12/05/16 18:25,Eau de Nikita
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I don't know what happened. I used to love this scent but now I feel like something in it irritates me (and I can't point out what it is)! I wish I could love it this perfume as I used to as I just got a big bottle of it. Maybe will have to give it some time as I remember it used to be one of my favorites, very feminine and sexy.",10/10/16 13:22,Camilla91
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Obsession night is my sex time perfume and the only perfume that I ordered a backup bottle of it in my whole life.

One of my passions is looking for perfumes that are non popular and difficult to find. Obsession night was in my list for some time until I found it online. It was cheap but in my country it is very difficult to find, in fact the seller called me and informed me that they have only one bottle of it in the stock.

The first impression was disappointing. To me it was an ordinary aquatic men cologne. But I fell in love with the bottle and even the box. So simple and yet beautiful. Then I noticed that that there were no ""pour femme"" or ""for woman"" label anywhere on the box or bottle, so I checked fragrantica again to make sure that it was not the male version and of course it was not.

Anyway after wearing it for some time I found it was noway aquatic, it is warm, woody, dreamy, a little sweet and unisex and at the same time wet...It smells amazing. It is an underrated perfume for sure. Maybe it does not have the best quality (it is not expensive right?) but it smells unique and is long lasting. In fact the ad perfectly describes it.

Since I found the perfume sexy and sensual I decided to wear it during lovemaking and guess what? My partner who hates perfumes and always coughs and stares at me badly when I wear any perfume told me how good I smell!",10/06/16 08:52,Lilii
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I simply adore regular Obsession and just out of curiousity I blindly bought a tiny bottle of Obsession Night. And I dislike it a lot! It has nothing in common with Obsession, except the bottle shape. It's cloying and simply boring. I cannot detect any particular notes in it. I am really glad I ordered such a tiny bottle and not a 100 ml one because I just don't know what to do with it. I also planned to blindly buy Sheer Obsession but since it has been discontinued and it's quite pricey I'll pass.
BTW I just don't get why CK decided to name it Obsession Night and sell it in the same shaped bottle and suggest it's a flanker of Obsession when it's obviously not. The same happens to Euphoria...",07/28/16 13:54,plum
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Wow so many people have good things to say about this, I found it heavy, and horrible, like some older woman smell, I find Panache vile when I was little someone used to wear it. What ever is in it I can't stand it, just wish I would pinpoint it.
I brought mins online as I did with that other brown teardrop shaped bottle by CK, maybe they were fakes but the seller had good feedback. Got provocative woman also, and now I can stand that one.
Gee I see a pattern....",06/03/16 19:57,dglightblue
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I am very happy that I've been waiting with this review for quite a while. I bought this fragrance in January and I was a bit puzzled...the sillage was quite poor, longevity non- existant and I didn' t quite know what to make of it. And now in May I can appreciate this wonderful complex fragrance. It is overwhelming in a good way. It starts rather sharp but within seconds envelops you with intoxicating aroma. I don' t smell citrus, not at all but a lot of white flowers with I guess, gardenia leading...there is something haunting about it really...no sweetness...it is haunting and dark..a bit aquatic...a night walk in the woods along the lake...white flowers, woods and water. Funny because I definately smell grasses and herbs (angelica?), there is no lavender listed either but think I get lavender as well. Tonka bean, sandalwood and vanilla...warm drydown. Mysterious, hauting, complex. Longevity and sillage are good ( in warmer temperatures at least). And yes, it has a good deal of this sexy intimate vibe...very nice for a date.",05/22/16 06:58,ladushka
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I love it on my husband! It's not really lasting on my skin, though for me it's a refreshing, beautiful scent, totally fit for late night's dates in the summer. I'd call it romantic, but not flirty. On my husband it has the perfect sillage, it lasts for 8-9 hours and it compliments him so much. We share it and we love it.",05/12/16 20:54,MartinaG
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"This is a strictly ""middle of the road"" scent to me. It doesn't offend, but it doesn't knock my socks off either. On me, it's very linear from first spray into the dry down.
I get a subtle lavender and white flowers (can't pick out the jasmine from lily of the valley. weird I know...)along with a citrus vanilla. I really don't understand the lavender, as it isn't listed, but to my nose, it's definitely there. From the notes listed, I can't really explain why, because I'm not familiar with all of them, angelica in particular. No rose, no cashmere wood (which, to me, is a bummer!),no Tonka bean, no amber (another bummer). Taken together, maybe one or more of these things, along with the flowers and citrus, accounts for the lavender impression I get.
Anyhow, I do like this creation and find it very comforting. I also think i'll try this in warmer weather to see if my impression changes.
In addition, it doesn't project past arms length. Very subtle...",01/16/16 12:29,harvest archer
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Lovely scent. I'm wearing it today and for me it's so sensual and a bit mysterious. It is slightly ""herbal"", I guess that's angelica and bitter orange effect. I imagine that also men could wear this scent, but for me it's a perfect choice that cuddles me on this cold day. I just smell the collar of my cardigan and I'm in cashmere floral vanillic heaven :)",01/08/16 01:41,Petra Pingi
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,I love it! It's absolutely wonderful fragrance for work.,01/06/16 09:34,kocicka
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Obsession Night is not quite what I hoped for as it's more berries than citrus and has an unexpected sweetness to it. I think it is the vanilla that plays that trick with me. The woodiness is pleasant, sIlage and longevity are adequate and the powdery dry down is lovely but current buys in the CK range that I find much better are In2u for a citrus amber and Eternity Night for a fruity floral.
I already own In2u & also have Nicole Richie's No Rules which does a much better job of the fruity-sans-patchouli genre so it's no biggie for me that this has been discontinued. There are still genuine samples available from reputable sources and mine hasn't turned.",11/29/15 23:20,Swamp Lily
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I've already reviewed this, but I just had to come back and say some more. It's already been a few years since this has been discontinued and I still haven't found a perfume that will suit my skin and personality the way this perfume did. I still have a 100ml bottle; it's obviously a fake, but dare I say a good one? I get most of the notes I did in the original perfume, just that I can really smell the alcohol in this one. It's not really pleasant for my nose sometimes, but it makes me happier than most of the perfumes I've tried over the last few years. So for anyone looking to try this perfume: you'll most probably be buying a fake one or a really dated bottle (and if you do find one, please PM me, I'd love to get my hands on one :)). Obsession Night will make you feel confident, sexy, mysterious and you'll be turning quite a few heads. In my honest opinion this perfume should have been called Night Obsession: it's definitely a night perfume (even though I frequently find myself wearing it during the day) and I have and always will be OBSESSED with it.
I keep hoping that some day CK will start producing this again or that some perfume house will copy it and resell it under a new name. Until then, thank you for everything Obsession Night, you'll never be replaced, nor matched.",11/21/15 13:03,gabriela.m.baciu

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"When I first used Obsession Night a few weeks ago I passed it off as a fresh, citrus unisex scent,more suited to daytime use but something has changed about it in that time.
Yes, it's still quieter and more subdued and not related at all to the original, which was a loud,look at me now fragrance but now it's a bedtime for two, come with me scent. This for me is not a clubbing scent, where it competes with a hundred other perfumes for attention, it's more elegant, more ladylike but she will certainly get her man. Soft sensual woods, white flowers and a little bit of citrus that will get you lots of attention.",08/05/15 16:18,allie kat
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"The initial scent when I spray this is horrible, it's like dead reeking flowers. After about an hour it calms down to something bearable, but that initial time... yuck. Don't care for this one at all.",08/02/15 01:27,katyas
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"As several people have noted, Obsession Night actually seems like more of a day fragrance, at least initially. It is soft vanilla and citrus and wood. But last night, I wore it to bed, and it was such a relaxing fragrance for falling asleep, that I think I understand where the ""Night"" aspect comes into play. For wearing out and about, I'd stick to daytime use of this scent, but at home, it will definitely be a sleepy time scent for me.",06/21/15 08:46,kiristarr
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,This smells very light and vanilla fresh. More suitable for daytime or workplace. Stays close to skin and doesn't have great longevity. Smells good though.,06/04/15 15:13,tru4reele
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I was so excited by the reviews that I blind bought a 100ml bottle because the standard Obsession has been ruined by reformulation and yes I have written to Coty.
Sorry fans but I hate this one. It is an early 00s unisex that clogs the back of my throat. It is nothing like my beloved Obsession used to be. It has that weird grossness that Diesel in the red bottle has so if you miss Obsession Night get Diesel or CK One or something. Sorry I can't describe it in fancy shmancy perfumista terms a I don't know them but I do have a nose lke a bloodhound and I am not a happy pooch! This smell makes me sad in my heart. After half an hour it starts to smell a bit like Vera Wang Princess got mixed into it but still that weird Diesel rising bile feeling. Luckily I am going swimming later so the chlorine will blast out my nose and throat of the last traces because eww! If anyone in the UK wants it there's a 100ml bottle up for grabs",04/07/15 02:48,fairyfart
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Love this scent. A bit darker than Obsession, which really didn't do much for me (it was the craze in high school, so maybe that prejudiced me toward it).
However, this is a cashmere wood, truly, with spiciness that stays on my skin. It will also cling to a coat or blazer, so there is just a waft of scent you get as you are putting your clothes on- usually I think, ""oh,someone smells nice!"", then I realize it's ME.
Lasts a while, and is a great all around scent.",03/05/15 12:45,Chieniste
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I don't see this as an evening scent. I agree with a few reviews below that this in fact is a great scent for daytime and office wear. It's heavy on the musk but bright with slightly citrusy sandalwood and vanilla. Not overly sweet or powdery and has a touch of an herbal feel to it.

I also don't see the link between the original Obsession and this one. Obsession Nights isn't sharply spicy whatsoever like the original Obsession.

Obsession Nights is not a head turner (nose turner?). It simply smells clean, fresh in a midly sweet and soapy manner. A very inoffensive fragrance even if heavily sprayed. I'm sorry to learn it is discontinued, but for US residents, CVS is still selling it online for under $30 a bottle.",02/24/15 15:42,Sleek Geek Chic
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"This one is quite a surprise because it's neither candy-sweet nor floral, rather it appears woody, dark and it contains perhaps a piece of nuts. These are typical attributes associated with male fragrances, but are only first impressions. This one should by no means be disregarded as being too masculine, as it develops nicely along the hours and becomes mildly sweet, more and more mysterious and sexy. Furthermore, it seems to last forever, Perhaps the ideal fragrance for hot summer nights? Give it a try if you are looking for something unusual.

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I don't see any similarity to men perfumes since I am not into unisex scents these days. I find it a really nice playfull floral fragrance. What I don't get is why it is called night, since for me it can be obviously worn during a spring or summer day without offending anyone. At my skin I can mainly smell the white flowers and not much of incense or vanilla. Well, actually the vanilla is more profound at the drydown. Also, I need to tell that it hasn't got any similarities to the original Obsession. Don't expect a lighter or heavier version of it. It is a totally different perfume. I would have changed their names though (this would have been the Obsession and the Obsession would have been the night). The sillage is moderate but the longevity is really big.",10/22/14 08:36,Bublegum

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I love this fragrance. While it is labeled as Night, I do find it lovely for daytime use, what with it's light floral scent. I prefer it in the warmer months as the citrus is very refreshing. This scent does go a little powdery on me, but the wood notes mellow that out.",08/10/14 09:03,Aliakatt
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"It reminds me of VS Heavenly mixed with Jil Sander Style, and the new Katy Perry Royal Revolution, but more masculine then the mentioned. Nothing new, but very nice nonetheless. It is a masculine tropical scent. A night time scent for dining or drinks in a sprawling metropolis in the midst of the tropics, Kuala Lampour perhaps? Citrus fruits and woods with a cashmeran drydown. Balmy sweet with an astringent edge. It is very unisex, strong charactered. I prefer it in humid weather. This would be even more lovely layered over a cashmere or vanilla scented body oil/lotion, and would be better suited for daytime if so. I recommend lovers of such scents to try it.",08/06/14 12:42,Pari88
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"On the first spray I thought, ""dark fruits."" It smelled like a tropical night in the jungle. The dry down seemed really powdery to me, and the jasmine started coming through more clearly, but still a little citrus showing through. I didn't detect the cinnamon or vanilla, which was disappointing, because I love a gourmand, but the mix of sandalwood, white flowers, and citrus is beautifully dark and sexy.

This definitely seems like an evening scent to me - something to wear on a date. I can't wait to wear it out with my SO.",07/15/14 01:06,Buriramtourakom
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"The first exclusive fragrance, which I found as a teenager! Evokes beautiful memories for me. It is sophisticated, certainly unusual and unique. A lot of people say that it is a bit masculine, but for me it's mint-citrus blend, although I know that it is not composed of mint. The first impression regarding the smell, which describes it to this day, this candy ice! Perfect for any time of year, many people complimenting them.",06/22/14 09:29,idalicious
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I really enjoyed this one, and hurriedly bought a bottle blindly once I heard it was going to be discontinued. I was shocked to find out that this has a very similar dry down as Avon's Sweet Honesty. The powdery note is amplified on my skin in both and doing a side by side comparison I could not detect but a very slight difference. I have and love Sweet Honesty and since it is slightly cheaper, I will stick with that one. Although this does not add much variety to my wardrobe I do not regret it, I love powdery scents and can you really have too many comforting scents. As always skin chemistry plays a huge role in how this will turn out for you, but I do think it is a safe office scent especially if you like powdery skin scents.",04/16/14 19:19,Thomasania

Just what I wanted!I wore it through the whole year, even though I've never bought it again. I don't know why I liked it that much at the time, but it must be due to a fact that I was craving for a more adult womanly scent than those sticky sweet perfumes that girls in high school usually wear. It definetly brings up good memories, but it's my ex-fragrance so I've already moved on.",01/14/14 07:23,lirael00
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I had a sample of this perfume and in my personal opinion, this perfume is really full of citrus.

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"This was a blind buy for me and I really like so far. Firstly, it's very different for the original Obsession, so just be warned that they have nothing in common if you want to try it. I actually figured this frag would be heavy but it's not; I think it's better suited for warmer temps but one could wear it year round. I would describe it as being a ""fresh woody"" scent. On my skin, the citrus and wood are most predominant and I can catch some floral nuances here and there. It has a very invigorating aroma about it; to me it's energizing.

I actually think a man could quite easily pull this one off as I think it's more unisex than feminine. I get moderate longevity and sillage with this one. If you like the fresher scents with a unisex edge, try this one.",01/05/14 07:42,Whit
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"For me, it is just light floral fragrance. Nothing I'd expect after sexy promo photo. It is just ok, clean, pleasant. Reminds me of one celebrity perfume, but I can't remember which.",12/22/13 13:24,mirisfrik
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"***This review is about Obsession Night prior to the Great Coty Disaster.***

Best fragrance ever in my opinion.
Was the most complimented fragrance ever, by men or women at daytime or night

Very unique and very pleasant and very intoxicating without being heavy, spicy, or too much or too ripe or too citrucy or too anything. The last Calvin Klein masterpiece.

That cashmere with bitter orange merged into something that looks exactly like the advertisement: Wet wet wet and wet. This is a wet smooth fragrance that feels like it was blended in the dark. Nothing like it. It elevates you to a different plateau.

Reinventing ""Fresh and woody"", full of spirit, just slightly flowery but not at all cheesy, with some intoxicating bitter hint, mysterious yet fresh, super elegant yet young, sexy as hell, without any residue of pepper and cedar or ""timeless"" hints.. it's all about the present. This was heaven in my opinion.
The citrus is not boring and flat like many of those gazillion citrus perfumes out there, and I wouldn't call it at all a citrusy fragrance.
I've had like 20 bottles of Obsession Night.
LOVE IT.

Compliments mega monster.
It gives a very strong impressions, people give you those spontaneous ""woh-wow! excellent what is that?"" compliment, before they even realize they are smelling a fragrance.
It had awesome longevity and projection back in the days...

HOWEVER... this is R.I.P

DO NOT PURCHASE THIS.
The Coty bottles are no good. A fraud.

THE COTY BOTTLES ARE NO GOOD, NOT THE SAME BLEND, FORMULA FLATTENED, LESS THAN ONE MINUTE LONGEVITY!

CALVIN KLEIN WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU !!!!!!!

Also, that was my signature since I first laid my nose on it, and now I'm lost with no identity, no protecting halo, so if you liked it back at the time when NY was responsible for the production and think there's something else I must love, please, do message me!",11/24/13 12:35,EllyBabeGold
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I really like this! Obsession Night is indeed unisex. It smells quite reminiscent of Van Cleef & Arpels' Midnight in Paris! There's less of a leathery note here, no tea, and a little more bergamot; but that deep, leathery vanilla characteristic of MIP is definitely here. There's a slight hint of mint with this one as well, I think, a 'coolness' of sorts. I'll keep this one in my collection as long as I can find it. Very nice!!

One thing to mention, however, is that while both ON and MIP are quite lovely, MIP lasts quite a bit longer and projects farther. ON is much more of an intimate fragrance, while MIP makes more of a statement.",09/26/13 23:20,lyciumchld

CK would have nailed this one no doubt if it lasted longer...longevity is decent at best but that's par for the course when it comes to CK fragrances in my experience...i really like this scent a lot i just wish i got more mileage out of it as this is a scent i want to smell for a loooong time =) i do have success if i spray it in the crook of my arm...i know, i must look ridiculous sniffing the inside of my elbow like a fiend but it's all good cuz this smells delicious!",08/27/13 17:24,stardust808

I am trying it out a 2nd time today, and that same note got me again. It is almsot all gone now (after 45 minutes) but so is the rest of the scent. I am not accustomed to having an EDP disappear so quickly.",08/22/13 12:18,SadieBluesLady

I just saw about 20 bottles of this in a shop in London for a very good price, I'd better buy it before they sell out. It's such a pleasant, classic, dreamy fragrance.

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I must preface this review by saying that I have tested 5 CK 'fumes and have not liked any of them. Clearly I am not in sync with this brand but there are so many great reviews for this fragrance....shrugs...we can't all like the same things.

To me, this is an insipid fragrance. True, it is nothing like the curried original but it's nothing special, designed and marketed for the Gen X masses - woody, citrus - ground breaking! The only thing interesting was the use of Angelica but everything else was just a standard inclusion with nothing really pulling it's fragrant weight. I find it unisex and lacking the confidence to carry off something with more personality, it just kind of blends in in a way that might have been attractive to me in my early 20's. I feel it was released 10 years too late to be fashionable, I think it would have been a great accompaniment to the 90's along with Eternity.",05/15/13 16:33,Lubylikes
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Hi, kaejuntun, amazing review!
You describe this beauty so well,and spoke exactly my words!",05/02/13 22:08,Juma
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Blind bought this based on the reviews -

Oh. My. Word.

Opened the package and sprayed this inside the box to get a feel for the fragrance before I put it on my skin and wasn't so sure about it - smelled a little sharp, powdery, spicy, balmy... Not really what I was hoping it would be. And then I tried it on the skin.

This is FANTASTIC!!! I am absolutely LOVING it. The woods are so smooth, not masculine at all, and the vanilla is sweet but not overly so. The flowers are very subdued on me - I think they do a good job of keeping the fragrance feminine. Creamy, soft, warm, probably best suited for cooler weather. I can't take my nose away from my wrist! It wears so close to the skin, keeping the fragrance intimate without being too ""raw"" if that makes sense. It reveals a certain sensuality without being too bold. This could be worn either day or night, I suppose, but would probably be best worn at night.

An unimaginably successful blind buy! Delicious.",05/02/13 14:23,kaejuntun
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I think the original is stronger but this is still a nice fragrance. I think I was expecting it to be stronger because the ""night"" or ""noir"" versions usually are but not in this case. Not really a criticism just an observation. If you are expecting the overpowering nature of the original you will not find it here.

Instead this is very mellow and relaxing -- if this is ""Night"" the sort of evening I picture is a deep twilight before the moon has risen, when everything is dark and peaceful, with crickets chirping, and everything becoming slightly dewy as the temperature drops.

The woods and the vanilla are most dominant and the notes are quite good and long lasting. A little citrus in the opening but not overwhelming. Reminds me of a toned down Samsara -- not spicy but the woods remind me of it. The vanilla is the same vanilla as the original.

It is more linear than the original -- the woods and vanilla dominate the whole way through rather than progressing through a complex series of notes.

It's very lovely but it is not the same strength and projection of the original. A very peaceful, quiet Night.",04/19/13 22:28,Museumgal
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"It's nothing like original Obsession which was one of the few CK's that i liked.
It's a floriental that feels very predictable..
A bit like Dream Angels Heavenly, only less powdery, a much 'damper' scent . Alcoholic citruses, damp watered woods and basic warm sweet vanilla - it does not smell bad but i couldn't stand it on my skin, so i gave it away after few tries. Very 'campus' smelling.",03/08/13 00:48,PastelMoon

However, after a half hour or so, it really starts to balance out. I definitely get some citrus and tonka bean but I'm not sure what else. It lasted about 6 hours on me.

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"This one i have had over and over again. I do love it but have to be in the righ sort of mood for it...

Actually, i have recently given a bottle of a tester away - in my opinion the testers are sometimes stronger than the EDTs - because when i sprayed it i usually forgot and sprayed too much, which was actually giving me headaches.. never happened with my normal EDTs before..

i have got a mini spray which does not do that, so i will get another one soon - maybe father christmas shall bring me some again :)

Anyway, this fragrance is warm and interesting, lasts a long time on me, and dries down lovely...

What is even better, my beloved loves the male version of this, which is GORGEOUS and clean, so we have matching fragrances... Sad but for that reason i do not think i could ever let this one go...

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Glad I got the mini of this fragrance. I like it but unfortunately do not love it. If I would have to associate it with something related to Night it would be the white-blue moon since it is mysterious, light and somewhat luminous. The notes seem misleading since on me this frag smells a bit masculine and very fresh. I was expecting something smoldering and warm. It does have cozy notes but is too unisex to my liking. A great frag I would use for day though! I find it 'fallish' and like the fact it stays close to the skin. To me, it has a calming and balancing effect which I love. Shall not get a f.b. though...",10/03/12 07:23,rosembloom
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"24. september 2012

Let me start by saying that i LOVE the vintage ""Obsession"" original and the modern one is also very nice. So when i saw this in local store at a discount price recently i was eager to try it and had high hopes for this one. Honestly, i didn´t know what i expected it to be, since ""night"" part makes you think of something very ""sexy and seductive"" but the original one is already quite an evening fragrance.
Well, i am totally dissapointed, but mostly beacuse i had really high hopes and associations with original ""Obsession"". Like already mentioned many times before - this has NOTHING to do with original ""Obsession"", except the bottle design, label, and name (partly). I can´t see it as a ""night"" fragrance at all. If only this would be the quietest night on earth by the lake on an early spring day. Very watery and woodsy. Gardeina, wood, lilly of the valley and orange is mostly what i get from it. This could be easily the men´s fragrance, that much masculine drydown it has. The drydown is all about angelica and wood. I don´t smell anything powdery here at all!
To me this is a plain. Sadly. I really wanted to like it but it didn´t fulfill my expectations at all.
Though it has a decent sillage and quite ok lasting power but i will pass. Not my cup of tea at all.

Please do not remove this comment, since others might find it useful. Not every review should be positive, so people like me wanted to make a blind buy might find it very informative. Thanks.",09/24/12 12:03,passionata20
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"This was a blind buy and I'm so happy with it! To me, this smells like 'Eau ressourcant'from Clarins. I really love Eau ressourcant, but there's no eau de parfum and the eau fraiche and eau de toilette have no staying power. Obession Night is an eau de parfum and stays with me during the day! The scent is sexy, a bit masculin, but in a really good way. It's nice and fresh and makes you feel clean and relaxed. The way Eau ressourcant was intended to be ;-) Makes a nice combo with de original Obsession. I use Obsession Night during the day and Obsession for nights out! So it's opposite to what the names suggest!",09/18/12 01:48,Beeb26

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein Obsession Night Woman is masterfully blended without any one particular note being overly discernable or overpowering on opening.

The resinous base of sensual tonka and earthy vanilla become a little more prominent as the fragrance dries down, all the while remaining lightly infused with citrus and a small handful of white petals. Amber also glows gently and radiates a comforting warmth. I dare say that I also detect a little creamy almond or marzipan-like accord.

Woody, clean, gently floral, very smooth and diaphanous. Obsession Night Woman is an enigmatic fragrance akin to waxy, sweet moonlight on a balmy summer's eve.",08/11/12 01:48,Tigerlillian
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I just picked up my package with some perfumes I ordered online, of which one is Obsession Night. It's beautiful, both the bottle and the scent. I smelled the sprayer and I can tell it's related to Obsession, at least from what my nose can tell. There were someone else who didn't think so. It's not as strong as the original Obsession(which I think smells a bit masculine), but there are some notes in it that is also in Obsession, so I can smell they are related. Although Obsession Night is softer, more delicate, not as ""in your face"" as the original and defenitely more feminine. It's toned down a step or two. But I like it. I feel the original can be too strong sometimes, so this was a nice surprise(I blind bought it). I think the scent is sensual or maybe even romantic. It could be a bit stronger though. But it gives a feeling of sensuality, so I would defenitely wear it when going out in the evening. Sensual evening wear, for sure.",08/10/12 07:03,kitten_steele

However, it and my jewelry bag were stolen out of my checked luggage! So if anyone is curious as to what OV smells like, it smells a lot like Obsession Night.

It is bright with juicy orange citrus over light woods and sandalwood. To my nose the white flowers are more of a backdrop, but they are present. I normally do not like citrus, but this is a nice take of citrus mixed with a great wood. The cashmere is there too. That just might be the note that brings this to the top.

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"It is actually a pity CK named this fragrance Obsession Night - I guess that under another name it would be perceived as a separate entity, without the disappointment caused by high expectations referred to the original Obsession. And no, this is not really a night fragrance as the name suggests - the original could easily be considered a night one by today's standards.

Obsession Night works fine in autumn/winter daytime as an inoffensive, fresh, clean, a bit sourish and rather invigorating EDP.

The scent is incredibly herbal thanks to the prominent angelica - once it appears at the beginning, it stays strong till the end and completely dominates other notes. There is some wood and citrus mixture that supports the effect and only in the drydown a slight vanillic accord appears. The white flowers here are so much different than in other floral/oriental floral perfumes that I am a bit confused whether they exist in N.O. at all - well, the exception is the lily of the valley which is easily detectable.

Sillage is limited, longevity up to 3-4 hrs on my skin, but much better on clothes. It is not UBER-feminine, but it is not masculine.

I like it, it is wearable especially if you are tired of heavier perfumes and need a short break once in a while, but I won't buy it again.",11/22/11 01:04,blueberry
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"When I spray this on I get a blast of wood from it (which I don't mind at all because I like wood) When that tames down a bit I can smell the rose and lily of the valley, then a little vanilla.

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I don't really consider the social implications of ""women's"" fragrances since I hardly ever wear them in public (usually it's by accident, such as when I don't think I'll be going out but then something comes up and I don't have much choice). There's something about this fragrance that intrigues me, but I have to be in the mood for the accord that opens it up, and I'm guessing there is strong angelica that is most responsible. If I'm not in the mood, it comes across as ""hair spray.""

If I am in the mood, it comes across as floral/fresh, but with a really interesting and enjoyable edge to it. Over time, the vanillic/tonka gets stronger and stronger, but never becomes obnoxious. Basically, if you're lucky, you will perceive a nice dynamism between these two dominant elements that lasts quite a long time and with good projection (""sillage""). Considering what is marketed to men these days, I don't see why this couldn't be marketed as ""unisex."" I do get the idea that this has a somewhat ""synthetic"" quality, so be sure you are in the mood for it and don't smell it up close on the skin.

UPDATE: California by Holliser (a ""men's"" scent) has a very similar drydown. I wouldn't be surprised if the same perfumer created both of these.",10/02/11 16:30,Bigsly

Its a very nice fragrance, but sadly not in the same class as its older sister. It doesn't have that power or the instant recognition but its a pleasant enough floral which starts off with rather bitter citruses. The fruits don't stay for long, giving way to a powdery floral pretty quickly. I'm left with a delightful cashmere vanilla that stays with me several hours.",03/26/11 11:47,sofababe
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"The angelica note stays with me throughout the entire dry-down, and it feels out of place in the composition. It's probably just my chemistry, but I think the rest of the fragrance is so lovely that it doesn't need it.

Obsession Night feels aquatic in an earthy, midnight sort of way. But with the angelica ever present, I feel I am smelling not only cool clean air and wafts rising from a babbling brook somewhere in a damp forest at midnight, but also the algae growing on the rocks and in the crevices along the banks of that brook. And then that note begins to remind me of the bitter, green smell of flower water...

My favorite part of this fragrance is the dry-down, where the gentle note of cashmere wood surfaces, and the sweetness of tonka and vanilla emerge.

While it's not a fragrance I would recommend for evening wear, it does evoke images of the night.",02/14/11 16:20,Jillzilla

First time I smelled it I really did not like it. But now - it is winter - I keep smelling it, again and again. I find it floral-woody-oriental, feminine and sexy.
I'm in a period in my life during which my self-esteem as a woman dropped down, but this perfume, somehow, made me feel feminine and attractive again, it made me dress beautifully and sexy, use make-up, accesories and... perfume :)

Obsession Night is a day time scent easily wearable. Quite the opposite of what I have been expecting, because of the name, and knowing the darkness of original Obsession. As sherapop said totally misnamed perfume. This doesn't seem like Obsession, nor it evokes night. In fact, doesn't even seem as CK.

Night is a light floral (doesn't seem oriental to me) with pronounced woody notes. Possesses tender sweetness and imprint of tiniest spice. Find it gentle and joyful, quite unique and lovable. Has long lasting time and average power, appropriate for wearing during entire year. Recommend it highly!

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein OBSESSION NIGHT WOMAN is a great flanker, but it is completely misnamed. It should really be called: CERRUTI 1881 SANS SAVON. I jest not, the similarities between ONW and CERRUTI 1881 are patent, despite the apparent dissimilarities of their floral notes. The bases are nearly identical, and the proportions of flowers must be about the same, although OBSESSION NIGHT WOMAN boasts neither iris nor violet.

It's rather remarkable, in fact, how wrong OBSESSION NIGHT WOMAN is as a name for this very likeable, totally unobsessional, daytime, unisex fragrance. This is a light woody-floral, slightly sweet and barely spicy perfume, which I like a lot. I prefer CERRUTI 1881, because it has a bit more depth and I do like its soupcon of soapiness, but if I run into a bottle of ONW, I might well add it to my collection. Very nice and subtle. Essentially the antithesis of OBSESSION.",01/09/11 12:41,sherapop
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"It's my mistake, ive put very high expectation to Obsession Night. I have the original Obsession (O) and Secret Obsession (SO) with me tho. I never want Night Obsession to be as loud as the original Obsession or SO, but at least the keyword such as mysterious, dark or anything like that (perhaps like Midnight Poison?)

But what I get is something which is almost similar to Lancome Miracle Forever. The Vick's Vapor Rub smell it's the one definitely u'll get when u spray this. And oh yes, it will introduce itself with a burst if fresh and citrusy smell. On my skin, the dry down was nice. No more the citrusy-fresh into like before, but more to soft sweet smell with a hint of jasmine. And after long time, you can really smell the sandalwood, amber and vanilla playing together. Im not sure how's cashmere wood smell, but overall ON will give a slight masculine character especially on its base part (not too much, but it's good for me when my mood strikes for a non-girly scent on certain day).

Yes, you can wear this not only at night but also daytime. Since it's completely different than SO (too flowery for u?) and original O, you don't have to worry if people will give you one kind of look when you wear this (like how my colleague reacted when she smelled me in Obsession at the workplace). To me NO it's ok. Nothing really special or unique about it though. Coz ive already smelled it on Miracle Forever. What a bad coincidence...

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"(Thank you Tane4ka for this tester)

Obsession Night in my opinion is a modern and more wearable version of Obsession. I can pull this day and night, summer and winter. Really clean and fresh, the citrus notes are really well balanced with the flowers.
Its sharp in the beginning but after a couple of minutes it becomes softer, a little bit soapy and lovely.
I like it a lot and I think its a perfect scent that can be used at work, as a casual scent or a flirty night fragrance.

Like here a verey unsubtle citrus which gives me the creeps. I had bought a mini unsmelled and I when I walked out the shop I sprayed it on my scarf. A few minutes later I kept thinking: 'who is wearing that cheap smelling perfume?' first I thought it would be one of the ladies standing next to me in a shop, but later I found out it was me!
My skin tells a little bit of a different story: there Obsession Night has the time to settle down in a more modest way but still being very 'womanly'. For me it is between a like and a dislike, but if I'd wear it, it would be definitely ONLY on the skin! (i gave the mini away to my mom by the way, she is a chanel chance-lover, it reminds me a teeny bit of that)",11/23/10 07:03,melia
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"This fragrance struck me as being very unique, also being very different to what I expected it to smell like. Obsession Night in my mind, was a darker and sexier version of the original Obsession, perhaps a little smokier and sweet. In reality, Obsession Night is mostly a gentle floral with some masculine qualities, a tad too musky and in some ways synthetic, but not in an unpleasant way.

Everytime I smell this fragrance, I'm stuck for words to describe it. It's non-descript yet rather appealing. The scent itself is quite subdued, mostly a nice blend of clean white florals, a hint of sweet citrus and dusty vanilla.

Towards the drydown is where Obession Night begins to smell slightly masculine. It has a somewhat woodsy, pencil-shavings kind of smell to it. After awhile the scent does bore me, however if I bring my wrist to my nose and inhale deeply, I am once again intrigued and fascinated.

Obsession Night may be one of those fragrances that grow on you. As I'm reviewing this fragrance now, I almost feel bad for saying what I've said in the previous paragraphs, because the more I smell it, the more I begin to like it.

Smelling it again, it almost smells like baby wipes. I must add that I like the scent of baby wipes. My opinions on this fragrance are continually changing. I don't believe that it's possible for me to come to any kind of conclusion.

In terms of sillage and lasting strength, I'll give this fragrance the thumbs up. All I have left to say is that this is an interesting scent, rather smooth, sometimes creamy, and generally likable.",11/08/10 19:21,missk
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"It's been a while since I tried on a perfume that quickly made me want to find a restroom to wash it off. It was that overpowering on me. I can't wear this. There was a thick and heavy sweetness that some may enjoy, but I do not. Hot weather may intensify it even more. I have other things with most of these fragrance notes in them, but I am not a fan of gardenia which may be the deciding factor here...That mixed with strong amber.",10/21/10 22:23,guest_LeeLee
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"im so in love with this fragrance!!
i got a mini of this and im planning on buying a bottle of it!
i love it very much that i only use it on special occasion (i afraid it might run out). even if the bottle has the 'night' name on it, it is not that 'night' trust me. nothing similar to any other night fragrance.

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Finally, I own this! :) My friend gave it to me, because she no longer wore hers. Starts off with a bright kick of pepper, and it actually reminds me of Paris Hilton's Just Me. After a good 20 minutes though, it settles down into a mellow, vanilla-cashmere scent that is irrisistable! It's not cloying or rich somehow, and I can't stop sniffing my wrists! Very long lasting as well. I put on one small spray, and I could smell it for a good 4-6 hours!",10/13/10 16:24,StephD

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Difficult review. This perfume is special. Why?
Because it pretends to be an uncomplicated scent, but it isn't.
Outside, she looks young, fresh and a bit shy. Nothing too unusual. Little make up, summer dress, the lights of Times Square in a midsummer's night dream.
But deep inside, she hides sweetness and passion. Usually, 'night' oriental perfumes have a troubled soul. They are sensual, charming and desperate.
This fragrance isn't. Behind its innocence lies a tender happiness, a sweet melancholy. It's like a Tchaikovsky's violin concert. It's a confession, a strive for harmony, in every single note. A poem read in a sunset, a whisper in the moonlight.
He will come, with his dark eyes. He'll put his hands around her waist. The Vanilla will embrace him like Cashmere, the Sandalwood will hold him tight, struggling between the innocence of the Mandarin and the maturity of the Amber. A bittersweet kiss, full of fear, full of love. So longed for.
While the blue of the sky shines and the first stars come out.
Will it last?
Each skin will tell.",08/03/10 15:34,Yaheli
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I got a bunch of minis a long time ago. While cleaning out my stash, I came across this one. I tried it and found it a totally wearable fragrance and with the drydown reading a bit more masculine, I thought it was a guys fragrance and gave it to my husband. Oops! He wears on those days he needs a mental pick me up. And since it's flowers at first application, I can see how it perks up his mood. The sillage floats more feminine from the floral notes but combined with his specific body chemistry, after about a 10 minute drydown it trends more masculine. Because of that, I haven't felt the need to reveal it's really a ladies fragrance since on him, it really reads more unisex.",08/02/10 09:29,libertybelle

I really liked it back then because at the time I was looking for a ""defining"" scent that embodied my personality and that I would wear on a regular basis. However, I soon became overwhelmed by the constanct scent and gave it up. I did like it because it was something you could wear any season, day or night. I may have to reintroduce myself to this fragrance!",07/14/10 04:34,acingram
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"This fragrance is wonderfully blended. It does not have any alcohol scent. I am not good at describing the notes. I think with something this well blended it would be hard to separate the notes.

It smells wonderful on me. It is not a simple floral on me and smells very enticing. The longevity and sillage are both above average.

It does not resemble its namesake Obsession at all. I wonder why they did not give this a different name. This makes a wonderful ""go to"" fragrance that will not offend or shock anyone. It is much more pleasant and less erotic than Obsession. However, Obsession and Obsession night both are wonderful fragrances...just not alike.",07/08/10 08:13,cisco

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"Firstly - this fragrance has nothing in common with the original Obssession. It is a different era, different feelings, different world.
It is likeable and somehow slightly sharply flowery and woody (I am not getting any citruses) and crisp and quite strong, but surprisingly it is not as lasting as I would expect.
The opening shockingly reminds me of YSL Elle, but luckily only in a gentle way and shortly. Almost as if Elle (which I really detest for it's provocative agressivenss) was calmed and tamed and sedated and pretyfied somehow. :-) Soon it becomes warmer, softer and inviting, however, to me it still has a rough edge. Although not superbly outstanding, it's quite unusual really and almost contradictory: little dark, little frivolous, little modern, little spicy, very feminine, but with a hint of masculinity.
Sprayed on clothes it last much longer and also seems to develop much more pleasantly than on my skin. Still - as it evolves, I do like to sniff my wrist as it's becoming more sweet and soft and powdery/warm indeed. I will be wearing it from time to time.
And this is really nitpicking - but I am disapointed that the bottle actually doesn't look as blue. Since the frag itself is some kind of yelow/brown shade, the bottle is actually tainded by the darker liquid and appears more green/yellow/brown. To me personally it's a shame as I adore the blueness in those images! :-)

Update: I have said that this fragrance is likeable. Wearing it again today, I am actually starting to think that it's much more than that! I seem to be growing very fond of it. :-)",04/22/10 11:46,Gosha
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I got this one from my hubby 5 or 6 years ago. I hardly wear it, I'm just giving it another chance. Perfumes don't last long on my skin. My new strategy is just to do 2 sprays on each side of the neck around the hair and in my arms. Lets see if this work!

Update: I like this better on clothes than on the skin! It lasts more that way!",04/09/10 11:35,ojosverdes
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"This is just beautiful; I love how it's composed..the sweetness, fruits and florals are all balanced out really well which makes it smell quite refreshing but sensual -if that makes sense! Call me crazy, but everytime my classmate walks past, I'm literally inhaling the trail...ugh, I love it.
*If you like scents that follow along the lines of 'Armani Code by Giorgio Armani', 'Allure Eau De Toillete for Women by Chanel', 'Lanvin Eclat Darpege by Lanvin', 'Gucci Rush 2' and 'Chanel Chance', u should defo give this one a try!",02/05/10 17:08,Anahi
Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"I bought this because it was very cheap on sale and I liked the blue bottle. With Obsession being such a strong, spicy scent I expected the night version to be stronger still but this is a light reflection. It's almost as if Obsession is being out in the heat of the day, then the temperature drops in the evening and a cool breeze blows through that is obsession Night. It's a very restrained fragrance for someone who is the subtle type of sexy. I don't pick up too much in the way of fruits but it has a deep but light floral, like you'd expect night blooms to smell like in a cool climate.",01/31/10 22:05,NatWeb

Obsession Night Woman Calvin Klein,"All I can seem to get off this is a lean scent of pencil shavings-I live in a dry climate, so maybe that is contributing to the scarity of substantial notes I am sensing.

Eternity Aromatic Essence Calvin Klein,My favorite from the eternity line. This one performs in hot humid weather and what i find special about this one is that its not like the typical tropical perfumes whuch smell like sea sand and sky aka a place like a beach. No this is definitely perfumey and excuse me but i want to smell of perfume when im wearing perfume. Too many of those gourmands that smell like food or location smells that smell like a location. My brain dosent really know what to do with that. This one smells like sweet coconut and aquatic body wazh refreshing cool with some florals and sandalwood creaminess. A refreshing yet soothing and absolutely balanced performer. Really love this one. I like the og eternity but i do not like pachouli so cant wear it but this one is a WIN! 👍👍👌,10/25/25 22:38,Minoshka Noella Dsouza

Eternity Aromatic Essence Calvin Klein,"Oh wow, I would never think I would like something from the Eternity line so much.
This is amazing, sweetish, bubbly coconut fragrance with slightly salty notes. The scent evokes to my nose feeling nice and comfy after bubble bath or something like wellness. Excellent bubblebath, after shower time scent. 🧖
I wanted to buy the Bubblebath one by Replica but I feel like I don't need that one anymore.
Great for daytime, spring&summer, hot weather especially.
However...prepare yourself, this doesn't really last. The longevity and sillage is something inbetween...stronger than weak (not a body mist type of scent) but moderate at maximum, after respraying couple of times. Light fragrance, suitable for summer, though. I got the biggest bottle for great price, thankfully. The bottle is so nice. I love the teal color. Little storytime - when I was a child, I collected all kinds of empty bottles. Perfume bottles, shampoo bottles, washing liquid bottles, etc. I had one of a beautiful teal color and Eternity Aromatic Essence reminds me of that. :)",05/12/24 02:22,Skinterpreter
Eternity Aromatic Essence Calvin Klein,"I like this one. It's different to the original eternity but it does share some of its sweetness. I can see how this would be a dumb reach for a lady during spring/summer.
I get the aquatic and citrus notes on top, the berries and coconut in the mid, and for the dry down a slight sandalwood smell. Is it anything revolutionary? no, but I don't think most people are expecting that (and there's no problem with it not shaking the fragrance world, it smells nice and seems like something people would want to wear)
In terms of price, at the moment it is on the pricey side everywhere (makes sense as it just came out) but 100ml is slightly cheaper at Allbeauty in the UK in comparison to Boots & Superdrug. I suspect that with time the price of this perfume may drop to become cheaper.",04/05/24 10:48,FavourO
Eternity Aromatic Essence Calvin Klein,"Given that coconut and salty marine notes are having a moment in fragrances right now, I'm really disappointed with this one. It's a low-resolution version of these notes that is completely forgettable. Projection is poor, and the longevity is worse.
That said, I do know some women who don't enjoy strong perfumes, and would potentially like wearing this one, so I wouldn't completely rule it out. However, there are so many others of the same ilk (think Ralph Lauren, Davidoff etc) that are much better that I personally won't break my back to use it.",03/31/24 07:54,Electriclady

Eternity Aromatic Essence Calvin Klein,"11 March 2024

This is my review for giving it a full day wear test on my skin and also from the paper strip.

I honestly do not like it. It has indeed nothing in common with the original classic, which i rediscovered only couple of years ago and fell in love with, but based on the notes one can clearly see that already. I was really hoping for a true aromatic essence, full of wonderful aromas of lavender and sandalwood, it could have been so wonderful, if done the right way, but the truth is that it smells very chaepish-synthetic. I do not know why, but to me it dmells more fruty-sweet, than anything else. No pronounced lavender at all, indeed to me it smelled more like an older Escada summer flanker ""Born in paradise"". I do not understand where all of those ""reminds me of"" come from? There is in fact not much to talk about for this scent, that simple and uninspiring it id. I also cannot compliment staying power, neither development of the scent.
Not a safe blind buy, but the colour of the bottle is very pretty. I will stick to original.",03/12/24 02:47,passionata20

At first you get very strong hints of a clean boozy lavender musk which later wraps itself in a sexy coconut, beachy tone with hints of the original Eternity. The name aromatic essence is perfect being it really is a unique aroma that tingles your senses. This scent goes through many phases with the first phase drawing me away a bit but warms to such a sexy intriguing summer scent. Out of all of the summer releases I find this one to be the most unique and different, but not in a bad way. Lasts 4-6 hours on clothes, 9+ hours in skin.",02/28/24 11:25,TheJester420

Eternity for Women Reflections Calvin Klein,"There’s something unmistakable about CK fragrances, not a specific note, but a kind of signature chemical base that gives them all the same “CK DNA.” The moment I sprayed Eternity Reflections, I knew exactly what family it belonged to. It’s a simple, fresh summer scent, pleasant enough, but closer to a body spray than a proper perfume (think Elizabeth Arden - Green Tea). It opens overly sweet and loud, then fades fast into nothing. The dry down barely lingers, like it evaporates mid-sentence. Not terrible, this is something you’d spritz on after a shower than a scent meant to define you. Definitely body spray territory.",11/11/25 10:18,MetaMystic
Eternity for Women Reflections Calvin Klein,"Eternity Reflections reminds me of the Eternity Summer editions Calvin Klein used to release up until 2020. It’s a simple fragrance, perfect for spring and summer. The opening feels fresh and uplifting, and later it settles into a softer, sweet vibe. It’s not a beast mode scent, but it certainly doesn’t deserve such low ratings. The launch price was over the top, but now it has reached a much more reasonable range.

Eternity for Women Reflections Calvin Klein,"I love a lot of the Eternity flankers especially Eternity Moments so when I saw this going on a clearance sale online due to the box being damaged, I bought it without even knowing what it will smell like.

The sweet opening shocked me because I was not expecting that at all. I was expecting something light, watery and airy. It is strong in the opening then mellows after 10 minutes but you can smell it every time you move or the breeze catches it.

I can imagine how this will be by the beach or waterfront. You must never do more than 4 sprays if you don’t want to give yourself and others around you a headache.

Sillage is moderate and longevity is about 6 hours on skin. It lasts longer on clothes but don’t overspray because it is very sweet and cloying. I do get some powdery feel after like 3 hours.

When I layered 2 sprays of this with Lancôme Idole, it was an overload of pear and it was crazy sweet.

Would I repurchase? Nope. It’s nice to have but it’s not a love for me.",05/04/24 08:59,MadameMerola

Eternity for Women Reflections Calvin Klein,"I'm looking for a very fruity (more pear/grape/black currant fruity than strawberry fruity) but deep scent which I can also wear at night. This comes closest to what I'm looking for. It's fruity from the beginning right to the end. At first spray it's very fruity (pear and blood orange being almost the same strength but pear in my case a bit more). After about 15 minutes or so it gets a bit ""more complex"" (I'm guessing it's the jasmine). After an hour or so it gets a little bit ""deeper"" (guessing it's the sandalwood). I normally reapply after the first 2-4 hours and two to three times a day - each time the scent gets a bit stronger as the longevity and sillage aren't that great but in doing so at least the longevity gets a bit longer after each application. And maybe it gets better the longer I have it.
I'm not too sure about which season this perfume is best to be worn but right now (it's autumn where I am) I'm loving it - and I can imagine it being an all year scent for me but maybe a bit more for warmer temperatures.",11/21/23 03:42,Kixo

Eternity for Women Reflections Calvin Klein,"I bought the one for women and love it for everyday use. It's giving me Juliette Has A Gun, Pear Inc vibes, but fresher and not as sweet. I've layered them together and wish I'd bought a backup bottle of the Eternity. It also pairs well with Elizabeth Arden's Green Tea. I'm really loving the fresh, green perfs atm.",04/22/23 20:34,Noriii
Eternity for Women Reflections Calvin Klein,"I find this really appealing and familiar. I have purchased the entire Reflections release. The fragrance simplicity is not a negative, in fact maximalist or needlessly complex perfumes are increasingly off-putting and I find refuge in Calvin Klein fragrances. You could say marketing knows this and targeted me accordingly, but why should I mind? My interest in the brand rekindles and if they continue their minimalist aesthetic then I am happy to continue trying the new scents. I was born in 1990 for reference. Eternity original and CK One original have nostalgic impressions for me, so these new releases allow me to carry that along. I feel sorry for people who do not have the positive associations that I have and are extremely negative about Calvin Klein for whatever reason, no matter what they create.

Additional Notes: I am wearing this fragrance in Autumn, I think that it would become too cloying if worn in warmer weather, but time will tell. I tend to prefer its sweetness now as it comes across slightly sedate. It still has a heady kind of effect, but it isn't fusty. I may just like it because it gives the aura of post sex with a fantasy woman.",03/31/23 14:08,sprayonce

Obsession for Men Summer Calvin Klein,I've tried plenty of these Aqua fragrances but I loved this one as soon as I smelled it and so did my wife. I'm surprised it gets negative reviews to be honest because its so light and unoffensive. As far as the projection and longevity are concerned I think it has plenty of both. I can still smell it after 6 hours and a 20 minute motorcycle ride in to work.,12/14/16 04:06,azza55550
Obsession for Men Summer Calvin Klein,Starts off as a some herbal slightly powdery after shave water. then dries down to LHomme Libre/Stetson Black type scent. Its light though.

It's pretty nice, hard to identify specific notes but to me this smells more like summer version of cK Be. Opens sort of fruity, but not in an Invictus way. Then it's very similar to cK Be, sweet powdery with a touch of that fruitiness still lingering.
Performance not great but above average for the cK One Summer line and it's pretty affordable so overall not terrible.",02/20/20 04:41,Candyandy
CK One Summer 2018 Calvin Klein,"SMELL 4/5
Wonderful smell that brings me back with my thoughts to memorable summer and festive evenings on the beach..fresh, youthful and exotic fragrance. The notes I hear most are Mojito and coconut milk. It's similar to the 2016 version which had something more magical.

PERFORMANCE 2/5
The sillage is moderate for the first/second hour, after it becomes a skin scent.

VERSATILITY 3/5
In my opinion it's suitable for all occasions but only for summer and for boys and girls.

BOTTLE 4/5
Really nice bottle, but the vaporizer is weak.

FEEDBACK 3/5
I have received some compliments with this fragrance.

VALUE FOR MONEY 3/5
I bought it at 32€ for 100ml, wonderful smell but poor performance.",01/12/20 10:35,Rhaegal
CK One Summer 2018 Calvin Klein,"I really don't care for this fragrance at all. From the moment I sprayed it, it reminded me of generic man's shower gel. Very masculine smelling to my nose, I do not enjoy wearing this as a twenty-something woman.

Now, in the far stages of the drydown (4+ hours in), it smells less manly, but still not very interesting or complex. I am getting lots of strong cedarwood (which is where the masculine vibe is coming from, I guess?). I get a faint mojito note, although it is a very bitter/sour mojito.

I am getting absolutely no coconut and no pineapple in this - so there is nothing to sweeten or round off the harsh mix of cedar wood and lime+mint (aka mojito).

A fail for me...",12/10/19 19:16,JustSimpleThings
CK One Summer 2018 Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein CK One Summer 2018 is yet another pleasing entry in the line, like 2016, that’s not quite as good as my favorite, 2014. There’s a fairly similar mojito vibe to 2016, and it’s a listed note. It’s really virtually the same fragrance, which explains why I like both, with perhaps a touch of pineapple on top of the guava that’s also in 2016, with cedar and coconut in the base as opposed to just cedar in 2016. So by the notes, at least, it’s a slightly more complex, fruitier offshoot of 2016—perhaps less mojito, more fruit. Again, it’s very pleasing, easy to wear, and seems readily available on the cheap (under $20 on FragranceNet currently). It’s not much in terms of performers, like most Calvin Klein freshie fragrances nowadays, but it’s a decent value and overall pretty nice, a like but not a love.

CK One Summer 2018 Calvin Klein,"kingk4de is, unfortunately, correct. Maybe that person and I got bottles that had turned?

Yes, there is a note in this that is off-putting. Kingk4de called it ""cat piss."". ( By the way, I love it when users select colorful language when describing fragrances! Really accentuates the full effect of emotion.). I'd agree and to me it comes across as Windex window cleaner...which can sometimes smell a bit like ammonia...which is what makes cat piss smell so bad. I really like the notes, took a blind chance, and nope. The mojito comes across as just typical fragrance alcohol, the citrus is amped up too much and drowns out the coconut and cedar, and the net effect is Windex. Or car piss. Lol.

I may try it again later this summer and see if it does better in hotter weather. And it should as a summer fragrance. Or cat piss. Haha.",04/23/19 04:13,Tigidy101

CK One Summer 2018 Calvin Klein,"So, I am not as experienced as some others on this site when it comes to understanding the complexity of flankers. Even though I have easily over 130 bottles of cologne at home, I feel like I am always learning more each day about colognes and perfumes. This being said, I’m hoping someone can DM me about my issues with this cologne. My favourite Ck one Summer cologne is the (2017) version,it’s just super fresh and sweet. This cologne however has something in this scent that ruins the overall smell. Whatever is in this I smell the same ingredient in Hugo boss the scent intense. I checked the pyramid and didn’t see the same ingredient, so I am legit confused. I don’t know if it’s the pine or the guava, or maybe even a pepper of some sort. Either way it wants to be a good scent but whatever that ingredient is it smells kind of a bitter smell, almost like cat piss. Smell is obviously subjective, but whatever it is it makes me want to wash the cologne off right away. The silage is weak and so is the longevity. If you can grab the 2017 CK one summer, do that instead.

Deff no coconut at first.. and projections not great (blasted myself). Some clean vibes, more floral than I wanted. The dry down on me’s a diff story. Smelled amazing. Versace Fraiche/Dolce&Gabbana light blue for women (love that scent). Took hours though. Really good scent.. once it gets there.

CK One Summer, I definitely smell mojito and pineapple. I was looking for some warm/hot weather scents. I found some lovely everday, anytime fragrances, Elie Saab Resort Collection is my favorite. CK one Summer just satisfies the mood when I want something fun, reminds me of time spent sailing or summer dock parties. I’ve never bought a CK fragrance before, but a few months ago while shopping, I passed a woman who smelled so fresh and Springlike. She was wearing CK One Summer, and it had palm fronds on the bottle (2016?) I found this bottle in the men’s section at Ross.

CK One Summer 2018 Calvin Klein,"I really like this one! I tested it today.
It starts off very masculine on me, with lots of citrus and cedar. When it has dried down for 10-15 minutes, the white flowers, coconut milk and the other fruits starts to show up too, giving it a bit more sweetness, so that it feels more unisex! And to be honest I don't know what mojito smells like, but in this perfume I guess I can sense a slight ""greenness"" with a hint of mint.
So far I really like it!
It's a perfect fresh, clean and summery fragrance, it's very uplifting to me! It's not groundbreaking tho, it has the same vibe as a lot of other perfumes. But, I have recently started to appreciate perfumes like this, especially for hot weather when you just want to have a fresh, clean scent that makes you feel comfortable! Perfect for casual, everyday use.
Would absolutely love this perfume on my boyfriend too.",05/14/18 09:30,FrkFors

CK One Summer 2018 Calvin Klein,"This is a very fresh, light, sweet, bright, and uplifting fragrance! Definitely worth the buy if you can get it discounted. This fragrance is way to ""basic"" to pay retail for. (Never pay retail for any iteration of CK One)

Nonetheless, this flanker is an excellent ""spray & go"", ""easy to use"" and ""mass appealing"" fragrance for daily use during the warm spring and hot summer days if you're someone that only owns a few bottles of fragrances.

Longevity is 4-6 hours on skin, so you'll want to spray your clothes to improve longevity to carry a decant.

CK One Summer 2018 Calvin Klein,"I was really looking forward to this flanker. The notes here sound fantastic. Unfortunately, I think that it smells just like cucumber with a little bit of mojito in the head note. An earlier reviewer stated that he gets a vegetable-like sensation from this. I can totally relate. It is not unpleasant or bad. It might be actually very refreshing on a hot summer day, perfect for temperatures above 25 degrees celsius. Longevity is rather weak.

Maybe I have to have another try, but I do not think that I like it enough to buy it. The bottle is beautiful though.

EDIT

I have tested it again, and I must say I liked it much better today. The top note is still mojito and cucumber, but in the base note I could smell coconut with a little bit of guava. It is actually a very nice scent, but performance is quite poor.

Euphoria Collector Edition 2016 Calvin Klein,"I bought this today by chance thinking that the difference from the original was only the shiny metallic collector's edition bottle. I used Euphoria several years ago and maybe can't quite remember the scent now, but I think they seem to be pretty similar. The signature Euphoria's tart fruity sweetness and floral seductiveness on the woody base is here, pomegranate is definitely prominent, as well as orchid and lotus. But the musk is switched in favor of whipped cream, and I think it works this way quite well too. It is creamy and less masculine in the dry-down. Now I want to find the original Euphoria again so as to compare side by side since I am curious about what Japanese Loquat and Champaca notes are adding to this limited edition, or how they smell.
UPDATE: I'll be returning this. Even though the notes are almost the same in the description, I feel that this is too synthetic smelling in general and has harsh alcohol smell on the initial spritz. The dry down is much more pleasant, but I just can't get past the initial strong alcohol smell. I somehow missed this nuance the first day I was testing it out since I was mainly looking for similarities or differences with the original Euphoria (in my memory).

Man Calvin Klein,"i would say this is my boyfriend's (current) signature scent, and i simply love it. it smells very fresh and clean, a bit musky, and very very cold. i don't know how else to describe it - it smells like pine and cold air with a tiny bit of tobacco sweetness. i guess the sweetness comes from the wood or incense, as there is no tobacco in the notes. i can definitely smell the mint as well. i love that it has violet leaf in the notes, as violet is one of my favorite fragrance notes; i think it makes it quite romantic that our scents are connected in that way! lovely everyday fragrance for an outdoorsy mountain loving man ♡",10/25/25 14:09,celestialentries
Man Calvin Klein,"Longevity is the only issue.
Otherwise this is an absolute banger and winner. A beautiful, masculine, and calming fragrance that we could easily imagine in a niche bottle. I love it. It's a linear offering, but there is nothing wrong with it; it's semifloral, with a warm base of vanilla and spices that make it very comforting in a masculine way. Then, the real magic must be a note of violets that gives this petrolish vibe, very subtle but enough to make a dent. There is nothing citrusy; it goes in the warm, spicy, floral, ambery realm.

Man Calvin Klein,"A floral, summery men's scent that progresses in a straight line from beginning to end. Nothing special but not bad either.

Man Calvin Klein,"On first take, for a flash of minute, this looks like a retread of the already well-trodden Dior Fahrenheit model, with that burst of gasoline violet mingled with citrus that the top notes promise. But, in no time at all, at least on my skin, this mutates into a thoroughly American spearmint bubblegum, with only distant spars of spice that linger before settling into that summery, nutmeg kissed calone that is familiar to anyone taking the sun by the pool in the wherever US. The violet returns towards the end, like a distant echo, from a bed of warm, familiar woods. In short, those anchoring for Fahrenheit are better off with Mercedes-Benz Intense.

This is billed to Gottlieb but both Jacques Cavallier-Belletrud, behind Acqua di Gio and L'Eau d'Issey, and Harry Fremont, he of CK One and lots and lots of Lauren, had a say in this, and it shows. Is it commercial, not niche in any way? Of course it is. Original? Arguable, if you like losing debates. Is it strangely enjoyable? Well, any kid who has taken pleasure from chewing mint flavored gum on a warm summer day, grass waving in the wind, would not think twice about the answer to that. Is it a great value? No kidding.",04/05/25 18:40,Silenos

Man Calvin Klein,"Crass opening, that is very much comparable to an aerosol deodorant spray. Violet is the first thing you’ll notice, not unlike Fahrenheit. I then get nutmeg and a woody mix. I think if you could detect the amber it would feel a bit more rounded, but I don’t get it at all. For the price point it’s solid, but I can’t see myself wearing this daily.

Man Calvin Klein,"Hard to rate. Opening is a sharp scent like Fahrenheit petrol like (it's the violet) dries down to a sensible masculine scent for older men. Pretty standard solid scent but it's gone to a skin scent in an hour. Maybe it's just me. I love CK products all the way back to 1985 Obsession but this one is like a modern toned down Dior Fahrenheit without the super strong petrol smell. BTW petrol smell is from the type of violet used in a scent. It's not always a bad thing for me but a little headache inducing. I will try it some more and change review if needed. It's cheap so little to loose. After trying several days, I can't get on board. It's OK just no sillage, projection or longevity. The violet is too harsh too. I do not like Dior Fahrenheit at all probably the same reason.",10/21/24 18:41,ThompsonObsession23

Man Calvin Klein,"Very mid-late 2000s.
Fun, clean, inoffensive... Devoid of any character or personality though.
A scent for people who don't think about scent. Dumb reach, spray on and leave the house vibe.

You get a vague citrus, you get the violet leaf. You get the very 2000s blend of nutmeg/cinnamon and mint.
And yet, I don't hate it.

In fact, I'll be wearing it when I don't wanna feel like the fragrance snob who has to spray on Amouage's Reflection just to do his shopping or Dior Homme Parfum to walk his dog.

Man Calvin Klein,"got as a gift, sweet and woody. kinda simple and boring but its decent. 5/10",01/19/24 08:24,penguino320
Man Calvin Klein,"This feels like a pretty underrated scent. It's a mildly sweet, ozonic, aromatic scent driven by violet leaf. I don't get much nutmeg or other spiciness in the opening but it comes through a little bit in the drydown. The comparisons to Fahreneit aren't completely off but this like the CK version of Fahrenheit Aqua or Cologne. It's very mid-2000s in the sense it's not really sweet (like current stuff) and it's quite aromatic but missing the overload of early 00s white musk. This is an office-friendly, masculine release that is completely pleasant and brings something different to the table than you're likely to find in today's releases (without feeling very dated). There's an underlying tonka that isn't listed but is very present (as in things like YSL L'Homme) in the drydown. Sandalwood, incense, amber - nothing that I can find, even looking for the notes.

Longevity, for me, isn't as bad as everyone is saying. I get 5-7 hours, not a beast, but a good workday scent with low-to-moderate projection for an hour or so before it settles down. Not sure if this got watered down but mine is from 2008.

This is a 7.25/10 for me. You could easily wear this as a daily office scent. For what it's worth, and likely not a lot, but I've received multiple compliments from coworkers on this one.",11/06/23 13:03,maxpowerboston

Man Calvin Klein,"I bought this fragrance while exploring some cheap daily fragrances for work/gym use etc.

I was really surprised with this purchase and happy. Its a great fragrance for anytime of the day. Good for use in the office or daily routine etc. Its not very expensive i got mine in the UK a 100ML bottle for £22.00 and for this price its a bargain.

A nice woody fresh fragrance with the hints of the bergamot and orange at the top and a nice dry off to a woody fresh clean fragrance. Definitely a light young manly scent. I wouldn't particularly use this for nice lavish nights out or evening wear to a luxury or high up restaurant or venue, but it would be okay for general outings at casual places etc or somewhere mid market.

I do find that i can smell this for quite sometime after i have sprayed it. I always spray in the morning as i get ready for work at around half 6 of a morning and find i can still smell this in the afternoon after my lunch and still sitting there when i am in the gym.

I really enjoy this fragrance that i did decide to buy it again and will probably have it as a daily use in amongst my daily fragrances. I get through a lot of perfumes/Colognes etc and will come back to this again and again.",07/15/23 14:50,Gentginge96

Even given that, it’s very wearable for both work and going out, but it’s not something I will buy again because the nice scent doesn’t make up for the fact that it only at lasts for a couple of hours.

Literally 20 sprays on t-shirt ..1 hour later doesnt exist..none nothing what so ever. Never saw such bad performance",07/03/22 13:42,lingo79
Man Calvin Klein,"Ditto (repeat/+1) everything already said about poor performance. This will not project and will evaporate off of your skin very quickly. On clothes, I get about 5 hours when I dig my face into my shirt. I hope it will perform better after i get some air into this skinny bottle.

This is sold at drugstores and discounters for a low price in Toronto. The scent is really nicely blended and the quality is on par with other CK offerings. On my skin, this is pretty straightforward, a quiet leafy green opening, immediately making way to a dry powdery amber and woody base. I like what I can smell. If there was better performance, this would be a winner for me.

It's going to have to be my second favourite CK scent after Shock, and will be used for quiet days at home more than anything. I'll stick to using my Cavalli Uomo and Dior Fahrenheit for the office and nights out.

If you are looking for an accessible violet scent and don't want/can't get CK, Dior or Cavalli; Burberry's Touch is an ultra powdery one. Lalique offers L'hommage a L'Homme (original) which is slightly more mature and formal while Zegna's Uomo is probably the most refreshing violet leaf scent I have ever found and one of my all time summer favourites. CK Man fits in the middle of all these and will have its place when I need something quiet and calming. Thank you to our perfumer, Ms. Gottlieb, for this charming scent.",06/08/22 18:56,fanzypants
Man Calvin Klein,"Well, I don't even know why I am disappointed about this scent. I know Calvin Klein is not the most unique or sophisticated house in the market, hence I don't buy frags from this company (my first purchase from them was CK One Shock which has left me disappointed too, anyway) The scents of this house are mostly generic, synthetic and underperforming...This particular one has all these qualities. Opens up rather harsh and loud. The violet leaf dominates here but it's not natural violet. Then moves to the second stage where nutmeg comes up (no mandarin, neither mint) and that one merges with the base note of amber and guaiac wood and it finishes there...This last part is kinda identical to Puig Quorum Silver (which actually I adore) Now, If I have to talk about the performance or sillage I'd start crying... Even tap water would stay longer on me than this...The only good stuff about this scent is the bottle. Stunning box presentation and the minimalist black square bottle. Really appreciate this but that's all Folks! I have learnt my lesson again, I simply have to stay away from Calvin Klein scents in the future.",03/30/22 14:22,Llaszlo
Man Calvin Klein,"A surprisingly under the radar fragrance, I think maybe it is a little too 'green' smelling to have been a hit with the masses and stick around for longer. I really like the scent but it's one of those I wouldn't feel like wearing all the time. A rainy day scent, urban & modern with a nod to nature, a city park or garden in the rain with brightly lit glass & steel office buildings all around? Maybe. If CK/Coty released an intense or EDP version (and increased the citrus in the opening perhaps) they could be on to a real winner.",03/13/22 14:53,Dark Owl

I was repelled by opening so I stopped sniffing my hand for an hour. Then it settled down to what I'd say is miyake relative but I'm not sure since I had it long ago.

Man Calvin Klein,"What a pity I am not picking up any of the mandarin orange and bergamot in the opening. The opening isn't the best part of the fragrance. I feel it a bit heavy on the violet leaf and rosemary. If the mandarin and bergamot were more elevated it would've brightened CK Man, made it more fresh and light. The dry-down is good, as it settles into the woods with a gentle musk.

I am almost done with a bottle that I've had for more than a decade, and I won't be getting another one. This one's had its time, and I have barely reached for it when there were plans to go out into the world. It isn't bad by any means, just not impressive enough in overall scent and performance.",02/17/22 00:48,Vikkinca

As it settles down it picks up more wood and becomes more smooth, but it is closer to the skin at this point,
But it smells very nice and even some freshness. This is a good all around anytime Cologne that will not offend, also great for dates, office, or Church. I’ll give it an overall 7.5 rating.",02/16/22 04:55,Napasonoma

Man Calvin Klein,"Just got Calvin Klein Man and smelled the violet on the opening. I did not get the gasoline vibe of Dior Fahrenheit; there is only a slight similarity due to the violet. However, one minute after spraying I went nose blind to it. So all I get is violet on top and not much else. I'll edit this review when I test this out some more. Update: Still nothing. My nose doesn't pick this up at all. Got my gf's opinion on it and she wasn't impressed, either.",01/28/21 21:55,Eau De Treasure
Man Calvin Klein,"I had to revisit this one (the final drops of my last sample!) due to people referring to this as a clone of Dior's Fahrenheit, well I really don't get that I must say! I'm not a fan of the Dior at all, I appreciate the fact people love it but it's just not for me. CK Man has NONE of that leathery aspect found in DF, no 'gasoline' type smell either. They share some violet leaf sure, they might appeal to a similar public too (though not always as with me!).

One interesting thing is that CK Man was a collaboration between three perfumers, Ann Gottlieb apparently oversaw proceedings with Harry Fremont and Jacques Cavallier-Belletrud. Interesting because the latter would go on to create l'Eau Bleue d'Issey pour Homme (2004), which to me has some of the essence of CK Man, only in part of course, but they share some kind of stark, herbal yet sort of ozonic aura. Both kind of introspective, rainy day scents. Yet paradoxically they both open very bright. These two fragrances actually share several notes, the most noticeable to me being cypress and rosemary but CK Man certainly goes off to visit the land of violet leaf whereas Issey Bleue loses (or finds?) itself in a spicy forest of juniper.

CK Man, on me quickly becomes a close scent (but lasts quite well), which is kind of a shame in a way as it really seems to give off different nuances at different times, with various notes popping up to say hello during the course of the wearing. If only CK/Coty made this a little stronger, an EDP version could've been great! As it is this fragrance really is a reflection of it's promotional material, a sleek, modern (prior to the ambroxan craze) masculine scent. An office building housing a touch of mystery beneath it's glossy bland exterior. Not a must have perhaps but I think it's well worth a try if you find a sample or even a bottle at a good price ;)",09/25/20 04:22,TrephineArtist
Man Calvin Klein,"This has been in my collection for a minute..12 years or so and I’m only on my second bottle. I honestly don’t get the Fahrenheit notes like I do from other offerings. Don’t remember the last time I wore the cologne but it does get compliments especially from ladies. The aftershave balm is great and the scent in general feels good after a fresh shave! Longevity? I’ll say this is a 4-6 hour cologne..but I’ve smelled the woody base on my skin up to 10 hours later when showering after wearing to work. Insane sillage; put it on and someone smelled it across the street...wow !!

Gave it away to one of my colleagues.",01/10/20 16:26,Denzel Maria
Man Calvin Klein,"On the one hand, it's like a soft Fahrenheit, but it also kind of goes in it's own direction, in that instead of a contrast between light and heavy, it stays light so that there is only pleasantness, which of course is perfectly fine. There's also no major synthetic quality and the interplay of notes is compelling, with reasonable complexity overall. I have only tried the aftershave, which seems on the strong side as far as aftershaves go. In sum, I don't think one can expect more from this kind of release, so I would give it a high rating.

UPDATE: I obtained a bottle of the EdT and it's similar but stronger. To those who say, just buy a dollar store clone of Fahrenheit, sure, if you just want something ""in the ballpark,"" but you can say the same thing about buying a botlte of Fahrenheit itself! I much prefer CK Man to something like Bleu de Chanel, which to me is harsh and there's too much iso e super. CK Man is a light herbal scent to me, with a little this and that added for complexity (and no obvious lavender, thankfully). It's cheap, so it's not like some sort of major commitment of funds. Sure, if you are thinking you are getting something like vintage One Man Show when you look at the notes, you'll likely be disappointed - this scent is obviously not meant for someone like you. I think this is much better than Jaguar Performance, for example, which is a similar idea. Know what you are seeking and you'll likely make better buys!",12/05/19 11:41,Bigsly
Man Calvin Klein,"Very underrated fragrance, blue fragrance before blue fragrances where even a thing. Very versatile and mass apealing, suitable for any situation, but in my opinion perfect for office/school and even manual job. Opens up with a blast of herbal spicines that quickly settles to a transparent herbal violet leaf kinda scent and dries down to a nice violet leaf, woody base that might remind you of Fahrenheit. Solid performer and very appealing scent that is even unique considering that most of the modern scents follow strict citrusy+woody+resinous combo.

Man Calvin Klein,"I've had a sample of this for a few years now and I'll every so often give it a sniff, then ask myself (you know like Gollum in Lord of the Rings) whether I should get a full bottle.

I still stand by my previous abstract review below, that is the ambiance I get from this one. It's not a fun fragrance, it's kind of austere but I think due to the rosemary and the blend in general it is somehow compelling. A modern glass and steel structure surrounded by vegetation. When I first sniffed CK Man I was sure I didn't like it but after a while I kept having to sniff my arm where I'd sprayed it.

I honestly think some people (like me) will actually find some complexity in CK Man, a scent which is generally written off as nothing special. It's a scent of contrasts or even to (almost) cite the name of another CK frag 'contradictions'. Bright and strangely dark-ish at the same time, urban and green, cold yet somehow inviting. Definitely an odd one for me for something which seemed/seems bland on first view it's certainly interesting and thought-provoking.

Full bottle worthy? I'm starting to think so...

EDIT: I'm getting some similarities to Lanvin Oxygene Homme on the dry-down, not the exact same of course but they are definitely olfactory cousins at least. It must be the cypress and ozonic qualities.",08/25/19 03:38,TrephineArtist
Man Calvin Klein,"I claimed this bottle from my husband after I had read the reviews and i was curious whether the rosemary (my favourite herb) and violet leaf (i love violets) stood out in the fragrance.

I sprayed it on my wrist and forearm last night, and immediately thought ""wow that astringent/nose tickling."" I didnt smell any other notes than the bergamot, a distinct lemony blast, the bay and the cedar. The initial blast reminded me of 4711.

This morning I woke up to the most gorgeous fragrance, a very close skin scent, yes Man had transformed into a warm rosemary, woody scent. It was the rosemary note that had initially intrigued me with the violet leaf. Both are evident some 6 hours later.

I'm definitly keeping this bottle, it's well worth the dry down. In summer this would be great as initially it's very refreshing. It doesn't sell aquatic to me, unless it's the faint mint that will developed more on someone else.

Man Calvin Klein,"This is such an amazingly average fragrance. Got it for $5. This is my go-to scent for chilling at home after I've gotten out of the shower and I don't care, but still want to smell nice.
Happy to waste this, but I'm happy to use it too.

Waxy violet leaf and incense. Below average performance. I would hold this in higher regards if it had better performance.

A similar but MUCH better substitute would be Yves Saint Laurent's L'Homme Libre.",10/22/18 23:45,joey.w

Man Calvin Klein,"Most of you who have said it’s like Fahrenheit are correct, but their is an asterisk attached to that. Like most Calvin Klein colognes the Sillage and longevity are poor to moderate. This one falls on the 1 to 2 hours mark, so it’s on the poor side. There are some positives to this cologne though. The first opening 10 minutes it does resemble Fahrenheit cologne. For anyone wanting that type of cologne smell without the burning gasoline smell, this is it. The dry down is a mint/insense woody vibe. It’s nothing spectacular, but it’s decent for the price. I picked this 100ml bottle for $29 bucks at a Rexall pharmacy. I’m a huge Fahrenheit cologne guy, so whenever I see here on this site a cologne that has any DNA Fahrenheit may have, I’m in. It has some, but it’s not as much as you would think. 6/10",09/11/18 08:12,DaedalusX
Man Calvin Klein,"I have used it as a daily cologne for some time and then stopped, it was nothing special for me (although my girlfriend loved it on me from the first sniff).
After a year I tried it again and now I like it. Maybe I have developed my taste in that time or something changed, but now it is good.
It is smooth, not offensive and very attractive. I love when perfumers are able to make fresh sweetness with some deep notes. It has a bit of everything: sweet, fresh and deep notes.
Very universal scent, most suitable for spring and summer, you can wear it with official clothes, sport clothes or casual clothes.",07/21/18 07:50,eimantaspuskorius

It still gives me butterflies whenever I smell it on him - having beautiful scents linked to wonderful memories is one of the best feelings on earth. There isn't too much special with this scent, very basic men's fragrance with woody and spicy notes and a hint of freshness. I would imagine this to be good for a young man, perhaps a teenager who is just starting out with their scent collection. I think it is an excellent basic staple, it is non-offensive and smells very sexy and masculine.",03/14/18 10:27,dvpxo

It's sexy, masculine & freshness on him, not a sweet scent from my point of view which I do enjoy that, not too overwhelming also, a bit woody but not that much.

Man Calvin Klein,"As most of the CK perfumes for men, this one is underrated too. Not saying, that this is the scent of 2007, but really not a terrible stuff…. However a little bit too synthetic, but which one isn’t? The scent pyramid seems totally wrong for me: the cypress is not a base note, I can smell it only in the first 1-2 minutes. The violet leaf isn’t a top note, I can smell it with the laurel in the mid. So the first few minute is a big cypress bomb, than come the laurel with the violet leaf. Many reviewers wrote that this stuff is very spicy, but I don’t feel it. The drydown is a common woody-amber-musk combination. Except for the first half hour (storng cypress+laurel), this is a wearable stuff… but bit boring.

- Really jolly joker, good for any time (winter, summer day, night, date, office etc.). Only for men over 30.

- The sillage and longevity as most of the CK, a bit under the average, 4-5 hours

Man Calvin Klein,"Got this one yesterday as a birthday present, having never smelt it or even heard of it beforehand.
On first sniff I thought 'Generic designer' that literally gave off hints of Sauvage, 1 Million, a couple of David Beckham's etc etc and and was one of those that doesn't smell like any one frag but gives off hints of many. Best suited to a teenager or someone just starting out in frags so a definite NO from me.

However, giving it a proper test on skin I actually get a sort of Eternity/CPE/new GIT vibe off it, which is due to the mint, peppermint, violet and sandalwood.

Longevity is decent, 7-8 hours, projection moderate for 2-3, overall a pretty decent frag for spring and summer. Could see this being a gym or office staple as its easy to like, pleasant and unassuming and id be hard pressed to find someone who could take offence to it.

Although I won't wear it all that often l'd rate this a pretty decent 'work horse/everyday' frag and am pleased to have it in my collection.",10/15/17 03:28,JamiesonB
Man Calvin Klein,"I feel as though this is the perfect scent to wear any time, anywhere, any season. I guess the rather broad name ""Man"" is apt considering how versatile it is. I'd happily wear this day or night, summer or winter, casually or on a date. The top note is rather sweet, in the base I could really smell juicy apples, the dry down is rather masculine. It is a little reminiscent of Calvin Klein Eternity but it seems more mature and a little less summery. Longevity for me was pretty good, reapplied after about 4 hours, sillage is good too. Nice price at $29.99 for 100ml here in Australia. It has the potential to be a signature scent and would make the perfect gift for a gent, I think every kind of man could wear this. I love it!!",09/26/17 03:26,aussiecolognelover88
Man Calvin Klein,"My everyday casual scent all year round is warm inviting and masculine. I enjoy this simple timely aroma for doing things around the apartment or just food shopping.

Man Calvin Klein,"During my early days in cologne land, I scored classics such as KL Homme, Nemo, Versace L'Homme, Gucci Nobile, Gucci Envy, Trussardi Uomo, The real Aramis Devin and Aramis 900 in their original large bottles. And many others... The problem was I lacked a collectors mindset so I doused myself as I pleased and within a few years many of those masterpieces had been hacked or killed off altogether.

My point is this, my first bottle of Calvin Klein Man in 2010 was simply incredible, natural smelling, fresh and strong. My next bottle in 2014 was a hacked version, a puff of scentless alcohol water followed by shades of the original in the background. My appreciation of the original made me tolerate the hack.

Lesson: Resolve to buy the early version (of any launch that might interest me) and then buy a second bottle as soon as possible!",04/21/17 12:59,Cheadle
Man Calvin Klein,"Questionable marketing? Out of touch with 2007 trends? Whatever the reason, Man was unsuccessful commercially. Yet it is a quality fragrance, to my nose. The batch I received has a ""Fahrenheit-lite"" vibe going on with citruses and a faint note of nutmeg in the background. I don't detect ANY of the brine/pickling note others have written about. There is a little undertone of ""manly body odor"" that I pick up on every now and then. Maybe this is part of what drove the name of this fragrance - and part of what turns some off.

Bottle design: weighty, minimalist, and solid. It feels great. If it were glass rather than plastic it may even be a '10', for a mainstream non-niche fragrance.

If you like violet in any degree, this woefully underrated scent from the CK house is worth checking out. I bought it blind and I am very, very glad that I did.

Man Calvin Klein,"The forest floor is littered with beastly bay trees - their cinnamon like odor tingling in the bronchi of your lungs. The wind sings its whimsical song through the treetops calling you to rise from your place. You see a trail ahead of you - it calls to be explored. As you ascend to some unknown height, violets begin to bloom mere steps ahead of you...as if magic is held in every step. The trail winds is serpentine path toward an imposing peak, far from view. The silence of the forest takes hold of your wandering mind - it forces you to face questions of your being. Are you man, machine, or some natural force yet to be revealed...you continue to climb. The smell of nutmeg clings to the air as does hints of some from some faraway fire. As you break above the treeline, the world opens up and you are confronted by a ferocious wind cloaking giant drops of icy rain. The world below rises with the wind into amalgam of spiced woods and sweet, gummy resins...here you stand, bravely, against the wind and the rain. Tensions melt away and time is forfeit to the elements...no longer man nor machine, you have found your purpose.

Listening to: The Black Keys - Howlin' for You

Notes: I must say that the greatness of my experience was provided more by nature than by the actual scent. It certainly is enjoyable as the bay leaf and nutmeg notes are quite present as is the lush violet with a faint waft of muted incense. These notes linger for a few hours before morphing into a bubblegum like wood and spice scent. The latter phase lasts around 8 to 10 hours but ultimately lacks the intrigue of the intro.

The fragrance is quite fresh, mingling some citrus with violet leaf, light spices and a vague incense. When the violet leaf is not so potent, I kind of like this scent. But then I remember that other (way more affordable) fragrances smell similar.
I like a few of the CK perfumes. CK One, some eternity summer, CK Shock and CKin2u.

Man Calvin Klein,"I don't think people realize the fragrances intention. It is supposed to be a modern man fragrance, with a hint of the classic man. It is subtle and close to skin type and supposed to be layered on skin and although not to be judged at initial spray, let it settle and project with a mans natural scent upon dry down, it compliments your natural scent. Earthy, green and woodsy like a rugged man. Clean yet earthy,dark but lightly modern yet classically brooding. It's not magical but not offensive. It compliments your natural scent giving off a mans second skin. It's not trying to be better than other ck fragrances. Nor trying to be a prize winner.",09/18/14 22:14,evilspin

Man Calvin Klein,"I think CK fragrances are being unjustly, harsly criticized with being unoriginal, banal, and with poor longevity etc. I think CK is a very good fragrance house. It can be said Calvin Klein Man might lack in the originality and sillage departments but it is a very good cologne nevertheless.

Semi-sweet, fresh minty-ozonic-woody cologne which is very versatile. Opening is herbal- fruity which is not very natural but in 15 mins or so the cologne settles. Close to skin with mediocre longevity. Very modern, safe and versatile.

Man Calvin Klein,"CK Man is an olfactory essay on modern masculines since 1985, circa Green Irish Tweed & Cool Water, up through Fahrenheit, and on into the nineties with things like Sport Field and Green Valley. See another common theme here? They're all GREEN. And so is Man. It opens with a peppery violet leaf and bay combination, which rapidly (within five minutes) segues into an herbal/nutmeg-infused hawthorn accord not far removed from Fahrenheit's, but less tarry. Violet notes compliment the hawthorn with a strong sweetness that pervades the moderate, five-six hour lifespan of this scent. But underlying everything is clean, soapy freshness, a bit watery and wan. One of the better CK fragrances, surprisingly lacking airtime with aficionados, although I guess when you consider that it assembles aspects of superior fragrances without adding anything new, there's not much else to talk about here. Still, if you want something crisp and pleasant in the GIT/Fahrenheit axis, this is something you should try.",12/12/12 11:45,karlovonamesti

Man Calvin Klein,"It's opening consists of two parts: first part is a fresh icy minty one and the other is warmer and sort of musky-incense-y. Unfortunately on my skin the two parts don't provide a harmonious scent; even in dry down!

I guess they wanted to create a contrast between these two parts and make it the second Fahrenheit! By the way it has traces of Fahrenheit in it, most probably because of the contrast between cold and warm; and violet note!

My brother got it as a gift and interestingly the problem is a lot milder for him! It projects a nice scent on his skin, but nothing special or groundbreaking.

Not a bad choice for daily wear in the colder weather, even though I expected a lot more from something bearing the name 'Calvin Klein Man!'

I think MAN is not MANLY enough, meening it is too floral. If they took away the violet and put maybe something like leather or more cedar it would be better. The longevity is ok, and silage ok.

EDIT 2...I changed my mind about this one again :) I swear if you take violet away and put little bit more woods/pepper this is Gucci por Homme.

Its fresh, its sharp, and its versatile.

I get a lot of violet in it and I am a fan of violet. I have gotten a lot of compliments wearing this and most girls dig the scent for sure. Its a very violet, slightly minty/incensey vibe that is fresh but robust enough to be all season in my opinion. Longevity for my particular bottle is decent. No worse than most other fragrances in my collection. However, a lot of people complain about longevity. Not sure if it has to do with how bargain bin frags are stored or what the case is.

I would have jumped on this so hard, had I the spare money, but now I realize I'm getting Euphoria, so will have to test for similarity because I'm pressure I categorize them very similarly.",02/28/11 23:25,Mushroomfat
Man Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein Man is actually pretty nice but it smells a bit like a few fragrances that I already own. At the beginning, it smells similar to Mont Blanc Exceptionnel Homme (orangey, herbs, and woody notes). It's not as sharp and strong like Exceptionnel, so it's easier to wear, in my opinion. In addition, it never gets spicy on me like Exceptionnel. To make it more interesting, I smell a small trace of coffee here. I must be out of my mind.

Then it becomes oriental/amber-like sweet like Halston Amber Man. Actually I smell something like tobacco'ish scent that reminds me of tobacco blossom in Graphite Blue by Liz Clairborne. Mixing in a sexy sweet musky base note, I am liking this one more and more. Unfortunately, I own other fragrances that I mentioned earlier, there is no point for me to get Calvin Klein Man... Well, unless I find one at a really good bargain, then maybe... :)

BTW, it lasts about 6-8 hours on me.",02/21/11 15:38,nattonline

Man Calvin Klein,"While I haven't smelled this one I thought it's a very dark, very heavy ultra-macho scent for mature businessmen..
But fortunately it isn't.

Top notes are not so citrusy, strong enough but not assertive.
After a half an hour somewhat transparent fruity note came out in the background which surprised me.
Maybe as ""tropic"" said it is that (for me unknown,but now I attended to it by Wikipedia:-) Duku fruit.
But it's nice to (a european) nose.
Drydown is unambiguously incense with guaiacwood,but they are not harsh just mildly smokey-woody sweet.
On the whole it is a pleasant manly scent, but not that way as I counted on.
Perfect office wear and wearable in any season, for any occasion.4,5*

Man Calvin Klein,"the top notes is not far away with dior fahrenheit,or u can call it clone from DF,
but IMHO this is lot of better than DF that smelled like rubber tyre on drydown till base.
CK man more pleasant on drydown,smelled very-very similiar like fruit that called Duku (from Meliaceae tribe),so it can be fresh-sweet fruity,
there are plenty of Duku in my country,so i can easily recognize the smell.
although i'm not fans CK brands,i give this 'average' (7/10)on my rating,
but i can't wearing it due the smell just like Duku.",07/20/10 23:46,tropic
Man Calvin Klein,"This EDT has too spicy notes of entry, like their middle notes are spices very marked, it seems a dominant anise scent of incense. Base notes almost identical but more pronounced anise.

In general I feel that dominates the aroma as ""a jar of spices."" The smell has a strange effect on smell, as if the aroma of a sudden explode and disappear, and reappear intermittently. A preference for older men aroma. Situations professional interest only, no fun or romantic notes. Duration of 6 hours on my skin.",07/16/10 22:59,andrevarx
Man Calvin Klein,"Very nice scent. i bought it in Nigeria. A blind buy but i really love it.fruity spicy fresh & manly. it is not bad as people said here. Girls love it on me. Silage is average, longevity = 8hrs

Man Calvin Klein,"I agree with chocolateguy... What's wrong with Calvin Klein? Ever since they sold their fragrance division to Unilever Cosmetics then Coty Prestige, their fragrances lost its desirability. Take Euphoria for Women (smells like granny's perfume) and the In2U series for example, they are all horrid! They have never come up with a successor to Eternity whose longevity in the market is admirable. They came up with Eternity for Men Summer but they only ended up destroying the name by coming up with a cheap-smelling, common and run-of-the-mill scent.",11/10/08 10:03,alabangcute

CK One Reflections Calvin Klein,"I love the original CK One; easy to wear, refreshing, cheap, timeless.

But some of the flankers haven't been as good.

I'm pleased to say this is fantastic. Green tea and lemon; you'll feel uplifted wearing it. There's other notes going on here that are not listed; there's a tropical note giving this even more personality.

Longevity and projection are very good - surprising for CK One I know - I could smell it on my clothes the next day.

I have received compliments already just from a few days wear.

Cheap as well so overspray if you're not getting the desired longevity; you'll not overwhelm anyone as it's a light fragrance.

It does lean slightly feminine - which I prefer - but anyone could wear this.

CK One Reflections Calvin Klein,"Reminds me of the iced green tea from Lipton, very simple and clean scent.

CK One Reflections Calvin Klein,"To answer dusty memphis comment.
You need body heat to dissipate the various notes with a fragrance. The perfume notes don't dissipate well on clothing. Fragrance isn't bad for you either , the fragrance standard agency has banned a lot of harmful ingredients.

It's fresh and citrusy with a hint of green, and there's a touch of floral even though there aren't any floral notes, making it a simple, inoffensive choice. Perfect for school or work, but not for special occasions. Longevity is just average, typical for CK fragrances. Think of it as a white T-shirt and jeans kind of scent.

CK One Reflections Calvin Klein,"Very fresh, pleasant and not at all sharp.

It starts with a fresh lemon that doesn't bother the nose, slightly sweet, like lemonade.Then a green note comes out, but fresh, not sweet.

It lasts quite a while on my skin, even longer on clothes. But it doesn't project much (which for me is ideal.)

It is wonderful in the summer here in Chile, since the sweetness it has is very natural, nothing heavy or honeyed, literally the smell of a lemonade with sugar and ice, so it benefits from the rich aroma of lemon but without that sharp part that bothers the nose that other lemony perfumes have.",02/12/24 20:01,pao_dc_live

It then becomes fruitier with some tropical notes followed by an orange-citrus aroma, possibly mandarin?

It has an airy, tonic quality and becomes sweet and a little watery.

The base is a light, clean musk, familiar to the line.

Good for both men and women, summer is where it'll work best, daytime.

Good for all ages really.

Opening is good. Refreshing enough, but the dry down isn't so lovely.

It's chemical, faint, blurry, musky (but not powdery), and, strangely enough, a little salty on my skin. Longevity is nowhere to be found and the same can be said with sillage.

The irony is the scent is completely gone from my skin within 90 minutes. I don't think this is even worth $10 given how terrible and mediocre this performs; there are other CK fragrances out there that deserve higher ratings, but this one's 4+ stars on Fragrantica does surprise me.

Mediocrity in a bottle.",08/13/23 08:54,washudtoj
CK One Reflections Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein cK One Reflections for whatever reason skipped the typical Calvin Klein release schedule. Instead of being in department stores to start off, they release them into discounters and rack stores first. Honestly considering the fact Calvin Klein fragrances flood those, I think it should be their release strategy going forward. Also considering typical Calvin performance, that is a good thing. I disagree with another reviewer about Calvin Klein fragrances and not just in the cK One line (or line extensions like cK Be, cK2, cK All and cK Everyone), many suffer from performance issues.

cK One Reflections opens with a blast of iced lemon and ginger. You get some tea from the mid giving it a bit of an Arnold Palmer vibe. The ice notes continue on into the mid with the existing tea note. The base is not that noticeable for whatever reason. I get vibes from a few other cK one flankers with Reflections. I mostly get a mix of cK One Summer Daze (minus the cumquat) and cK Everyone. Due to cK Everyone smelling like cK Summer 2019, I get that too. That isn't a bad thing. Honestly, I like this more than Everyone like I do with Summer 2019.

cK One Reflections lasts about four hours on my skin. It isn't a strong projecting fragrance but it is pretty good none the less. Good for spring and summer, especially as a gym scent. It is rather unisex. I don't think it is feminine or masculine.

Calvin Klein cK One Reflections I rate a 7.1 out of 10. I happen to enjoy cK One Summer 2019 more. This is good if you want to replace that or your bottle of Everyone without going to the EDP.",07/01/23 02:14,mkpunk
CK One Reflections Calvin Klein,"I have to wonder if people just automatically judge CK as being weak because this one (and many others), at least on my skin is anything but, especially for this type of 'warm weather' scent!

Quite long-lasting and with decent sillage. Alas, the scent itself isn't really my cup of tea (as I get a lemongrass vibe similar to CK Everyone EDT, which I'm not too keen on ) but it does smell good and of decent quality (it doesn't smell 'cheap'). It is one of those scents that might grow on me with repeated wear. Smells nothing like the original CK One to me but as I hinted at it's very similar to CK Everyone EDT but with an added refreshing coolness.",06/28/23 03:28,Dark Owl

Drinkable and cooling like a tropical green iced tea. When spraying, I make sure I hit my shirt too.
Very light musky but still crisp and cool in drydown, even though muted 4 hrs later…

CK One Reflections Calvin Klein,"The opening is nice for like 10 minutes. It’s basically just the original CK1, but kinda smells like someone put one spray of Erba Pura in the bottle to give it a little extra nondescript fruitiness. Projection is about 30 minutes then it dries down to a soft musky skin scent with some soapy-ness.

This is not worth buying unless you don’t already own a CK1 flanker. But I’d recommend the original or Ck All over this one.",06/17/23 09:23,PhonePotato
CK One Reflections Calvin Klein,"The opening on this is really nice, fruity and fresh.

I see other comments mention it being on the feminine side and the dry down on this definitely goes in that direction as it does feel a little overly floral but the opening is great and that part is unisex for sure.

I've sampled lots of ck one flankers and this was the only one I was in any way remotely tempted to buy. If you had a slot for a casual daily summer scent this would make a great purchase.",06/17/23 00:45,ashroloie
CK One Reflections Calvin Klein,"Similar to the original CK One, yet more fresh than citrus. To me it leans a bit fem, and as it’s a CK One summer scent, not much development. What you get in the initial spray is what you’re going to have for the next 3 hours or so.
Actually projects pretty decent for the first 30-45min and then sits close to the skin.

I like it, for $20, definitely. It’s a nice, uplifting scent that can be worn with ease. Also, definitely one I can share with the wife, she may get more use out if it than me.",06/08/23 10:41,millerje86
CK One Reflections Calvin Klein,"Just bought a bottle at the airport. Had no intention of buying anything at all, but after trying the sample, I instantly decided to make a purchase. Even made a sniff comparison with the original cK One; this one stands out a bit.

The fresh, citrusy vibe is very much what I need during this super hot weather. Some may say it smells quite soapy & tangy, but I think it's the type that calms you down. Neither provocative nor attention seeking, just nice to be noticeable. After 15 minutes of testing it out in the sun, I could feel the subtle woody second layer evaporating to balance the tangy opening. However, I doubt the sillage of this one would be very far reaching.

Highly recommended for young guys who are searching for a perfume to wear with their pineapple Hawaii shirt and bermuda, sipping tropical punch by the beach bar.

4.5 out of 5 for me.",06/04/23 01:42,Halian

CK One Reflections Calvin Klein,"Crispy. Tropical. One of the best they have done for hot weather. An electric ⚡️ tropical fruit slushie. I agree with the review below, there are ghost rhubarb and guava notes that actually sit front and center. The pyramid and breakdown is misleading. Feels super familiar if you know this lineup, like CK Summer 2019, 2021 & 2022 all mixed together. No menthol here for me, works wonderfully with my body chemistry. After a run with this on I smelled of Juicy Fruit.

UPDATE 8/17/23:

It's great still. The only thing it may be guilty of is being a little too derivative of the former versions. Don't get me wrong, I'm loving their beverage-inspired summer releases. I just sort of wish for CK to go off the rails and surprise us for once with the annual release.",03/24/23 18:11,Ceau de Parfum
CK One Reflections Calvin Klein,"It's basically CK One topped with huge amounts of pink grapefruit/guava/rhubarb and pineapple ingredients that gives a fizzy sparkling and sweet tropical soda effect. I can't detect any ginger but there's limonene lemon vibe that can be passed as ginger here. As mentioned by some others, menthol freshness is there too. I feel like marketing teams often try to come up with less common or trending notes and here is a very good example. The last decade can be marked with ""as little notes as possible"" era in perfumery. I mean look at CK One and now this, but if you check the formulas I bet they share at least 50%. And how in the world grapefruit, guava, rhubarb not mentioned is beyond me.

You can also safely assume all the notes your nose have registered from CK One can be found here. That fresh floral body lotion-ish drydown of CK One will be what you are getting.

It's a playful and tropical juicy twist, a good flanker and for 30 eur no one can complain. There are so-called niche houses that would shove this for 100+.",03/21/23 09:41,talkaboutscents

CK One Reflections Calvin Klein,Citrus notes and ginger are main players here. I feel some lime rather than lemon. It is a nice frech flanker. Curious about the Eternity Reflections version with absynth and chocolate notes that seems a bit more challenging.,03/10/23 02:25,BGBG

CK One Reflections Calvin Klein,"Ice note?? Tried this on skin blind without knowing the notes, reminds me of a less citric CK Everyone with a tropical summer fruit tinge. There's the same ozonic artificial air freshener vibe that CK Everyone has. Dry-down is very fluffy musky and laundry-fresh.

CK Free Blue Calvin Klein,To be honest I really like this fragrance. In my opinion it's better smelling then azzaro chrome but lacks the quality. The longevity is extremely poor with a minor sillage. I wear this to school quite often but I always take a small bottle of this(5ml) so I apply it after every hour or so. As far as compliments I get some only when people hug me right after I've applied this scent. Hope there's gonna be a good reformulation.,02/15/16 22:17,Kvn_shang

Well which is in Coty? Bottom line Coty would not accept any responsibility for this terrible creation and neither would Calvin Klein! AVOID this one!!",08/03/13 04:14,michael.krauser
CK Free Blue Calvin Klein,"This scent lacks projection, but it turned into a skin scent that lasted on my wrist for 7 hours in testing. I quite like the scent, and would describe it as a Lite version of Azzaro Chrome. It could be very useful when one wants to wear a subtle scent that doesn't annoy anybody. I've added it to my meagre collection of such scents (which includes Bvlgari PH and F Ferragamo).

CK Free Blue Calvin Klein,"Agree with Antonpan, it is 99% similar to Azzaro Chrome, except it is really weaker version! Sharp lemon citrus at first blast for about 10 plus minutes, and then pretty linear for the rest of the notes of a very mild herb + floral scent, in facts is too light until you need to sniff 2 or 3 times to get the notes, mind you - extremely weak, 1 hour after applying it, I can't barely detect any trace of it, projection is nothing, superb diluted poor quality fragrance, the ads does give you some hints, it is very water-y! But not aquatic scent!

Very disappointed with this one, CK Free already a weak one, this is even weaker for the same price, where is the CK frag that we used to know?",12/28/11 22:25,bwcw81
CK Free Blue Calvin Klein,"Another one ""modern"" advent of Azzaro Chrome (and apparently of the regular cK one). CK Free Blue is much, much lighter than Chrome, without metallic notes, but at the same time it has an awful longevity and average sillage.",11/20/11 05:51,antonpan
Eternity 25th Anniversary Edition for Men Calvin Klein,"Listen man, for that price point, specially if you can get it on a discount, it's a decently good fragrance for the gym or after a shower, you will smell good, not bad, not amazing, just good enough to stand out from anyone not wearing a fragrance I guess, this isn't a compliment getter though if thats what you're here for.",06/03/25 10:10,jesusdisz046
Eternity 25th Anniversary Edition for Men Calvin Klein,"This fragrance is the smell of the 90's for me. Its the reason why i bought this anniversary edition; pure nostalgia. It doesn't disappoint either; it smells exactly as i remember it smelling. I love to wear it during warm summer days, the heat seems to make it project better. I would class this fragrance as having moderate longevity and silage becoming a skin scent after about four hours. I think i will always have a bottle of CK Eternity in my collection. Its what i think is a classic summer daytime fragrance in a bottle that also looks classy/unique. I'm off now, to continue my 90's nostalgia by listening to Pulp's Different Class album.",08/01/22 01:29,MotorMouse
Eternity 25th Anniversary Edition for Men Calvin Klein,"I am wearing both, well just 2 spritzes of this one to compare it with the regular Eternity. I think they smelled basically the same I just found a little more intense settle down in the skin from this anniversary version, maybe because is newer and my big bottle from the regular version is about 3 years old or 4, not sure. But I think this fragrance remains in the top classics from Ck and still can be considered as a modern easy to wear fragrance.",05/18/16 09:39,joenick68
Eternity 25th Anniversary Edition for Men Calvin Klein,This frag is underrated one. My ex-girlfriend liked it over Bleu de Chanel. I think the bottle design well shows how this smells like.

Eternity 25th Anniversary Edition for Men Calvin Klein,"Substantially the same as standard edition Eternity. Does seem a bit lighter in terms of longevity and projection than standard.

On me this is a sweet type of fragrance. Definitely unisex. Fruity and very pleasing. But a whole day of this got to me a little. However I would recommend this one for anyone looking for a summer scent.",04/30/17 20:00,MrBumblepants
Eternity for Men Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"Bought this blind based on the praise but unfortunately was a scrubber for me.

I got a very light aquatic base with a lot of florals on top. Didn't really detect much citrus. A very boring fragrance for me and quickly started to bother me.

I didn't care for CK One Summer '14 and really disliked this one. I like Eternity Aqua but these CK summer flankers aren't working out for me.

Update: Tried it again to be sure. The florals in this are just stomach turning for me.",03/30/17 03:29,Oldspice

On my skin, I only get an hour or two.",11/14/16 19:46,PaolaFlow

Eternity for Men Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"Stunning! A Summer flanker with a great structure and an amazing drydown. Certainly the best Summer designer fragrance since Kenzo Homme Fresh from 2006 & Cerruti 1881 Eau Fraiche from 2007! This is well thought through, well crafted & blended and I got a compliment 5 minutes after application from the very first person I met. At the initial spray you could say its nothing more than a nice citrus juice but the further the dry down goes the more herbal it gets maintaining a yummy exotic vibe without becoming sweet or generic. Brilliant job!",07/13/16 05:07,CGV
Eternity for Men Summer 2016 Calvin Klein,"I don't give this a high rating because of its sense of adventure or unique, surprising artistic freedom, but rather because it captures the scent of a summer cologne so perfectly. It has the sea salt and aquatic character that one would anticipate, but it has a wonderfully dialed-up, tart citrus that lasts much longer than I expected.
I'm new to perfumery (in a passionate, researching sense), so it's possible I love this because there's more to learn. But I haven't bought an actual department store bottle in a long time, and this was worth it!",05/17/16 09:33,JohnPalSki

Eternity Summer 2010 Calvin Klein,"This is a very pleasant, non offensive perfume. I agree with this fragrance being described as ""safe"".

It's feminine, clean, and fresh (without strong citrus notes or extreme green notes).

Just don't count on it lasting more than 30min.",07/23/10 11:06,ronnieroo88
Eternity Summer 2010 Calvin Klein,"Unlike original, Eternity Summer is pink scent. Not kind of girly scents which are sugared and imposed. Summer is calm and gentle floral. I followed the peony and lily of the valley from the very first notes playing in citric air. Even though at the moments I had a felling that this is boring perfume, from the underlying creamy musk I could read the Eternity signature. And this made me see summer edition in new and improved light.

Summer is likable, not long lasting, cheerful perfume. Good chances are that many people will like this as well wearing and smelling on others.

I don’t think that any Eternity edition came no way near to original`s beauty.",05/23/10 09:14,zvoncica

To my surprise, this one is actually quite nice. It -is-musk heavy but manages to have an original angle with the plum & wisteria notes on top of the predominantly musk base. Has a lightness/airiness to it and some interesting, slightly pungent note (perhaps the listed red pepper) which creates an interesting contrast to the softer floral plummy notes. I also pick up on the elderberry which is a nice twist. Not bad but still a mass market product.",08/22/22 11:13,Frangipanilove

Wow I am really glad I got this, I blind bought, which doesn't usually work out well for me.

This is a creamy fresh warm berry floral, it may have some vanilla hidden but it's not one of those types of fragrances. not s sweet berry or sweet fruit, but that's fine with me.
It's a bit wet I guess, not dry. There might be an odd spot of rubber molecule or that could be the ( clean) shirt. Just showered.

Quite pleased with this, it's innofensive, not a real powerhouse type. I'll update when it's been on a few hours",03/22/17 22:36,dglightblue
Eternity Night Calvin Klein,"Now this is unexpectedly nice to me and I am surprised because Jasmine and Frangipani don't usually hit me in my happy place. :) This is incredibly strong on first spray and I made the mistake of spraying once on each wrist when I was at work and was sickened by the white floral powerhouse radiating around me. This will knock you and everyone around you out if you foolishly overspray, but what I discovered is that putting it lower on my body (back of my knees) makes the radiating sillage just right. I fell so in love with this once I sprayed behind my knees and the scent started to rise up with my body heat. This is a full-bodied white floral with gentle whispers of Wisteria and Sandalwood as it starts to dry down but the Jasmine and Frangipani remain the main players throughout the life of this fragrance. I do think this fragrance is aptly named and imagine it would bloom beautifully in moderate summer evening heat, but again, restraint must be used because it is surprisingly strong.",03/03/17 18:40,DarlingNikki
Eternity Night Calvin Klein,"This was on clearance so I thought I had to give it a try. This is all floral. Strong Frangipani and jasmine. I see why others smell tuberose and or gardenia.

The floral notes and the musk are well balanced, all in all - a perfume well-done that makes you feel chic without trying too hard.
I must add this has nothing to do with the original Eternity, it has it's own personality. I don't understand why people voted it to have poor longevity, on my skin and it lasted a few good hours. Definitely on my ""will purchase"" list.",11/03/14 17:26,Akarui_hana
Eternity Night Calvin Klein,"I sprayed this on in ULTA today, and I really wasn't prepared for what I smelled. This is a fresh but heady scent: ozonic, green, aquatic, musky, and woody. It brought to mind the first, intense stirrings of adolescent lust -- seeing cute boys on the beach and daydreaming. There's a little bit of a swimming-pool smell in this perfume, in a good way.

I can add that this is my new favorite Eternity*, not that I've smelled them all, but I love the summer 2014 flanker as well as the original. I will be stalking the discount stores for Eternity Night, most definitely.

* The Night flanker doesn't smell a bit like original Eternity to me, by the way. It could easily have been marketed as a CK One flanker.",10/08/14 14:28,ChypreAnn

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I loved the original for several years. I finally got the hard-to-find Intense and was able to wear it.
It is interesting.

It retains the basil note of the original, but the pepper is gone and replaced with a melon-like note. It also contains even a black orchid-like sweetness, and the solid and bitter that was present in the original is thin.
I did not get oud on my skin. I also don't get the bitter-chocolatey stuff.
What I get on my skin is sweet melon, basil, ginger, and amber.
It's great how they created a deep sweetness and darkness without completely destroying the spiciness of the original.

If you like this,
I also recommend Pasha noir by Cartier.

Tom Ford Oud Wood is one of my favorites, and when I don't want to apply that at $8 per spray or whatever it breaks down to, I go with the CK Oud alternative, Euphoria Intense. A rich fragrance that stays pretty simple after it dries down.

The top is something that is not mentioned in this site and is described by CK as “Ginger pepper cocktail, Raindrop accord and Sudachi (similar to a Key Lime)” - it really is more than just ginger and pepper.

This is really an amber-forward herbal that has a backbone of oud wood. It does lack the sophistication and staying power of OW. Calvin Klien's attempt at a friendly, wearable oud.",03/06/23 13:06,Ceau de Parfum

This is an evening fragrance that you can wear any season. This wouldn't be my first pick for daytime wear, no matter the weather. This scent is by no means boring or overused, but I would go with another fragrance if you're looking for a cold weather fragrance. It just doesn't smell amazing. I find myself barely reaching for this one as it's not that impressive.

Euphoria Intense actually keeps the original fresh Euphoria DNA, but with amber to make it sweet, and oud to make it rich. a good 2 sprays makes it wearable in the summer, and a full dose of 5 is perfect for the fall and winter.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Not a bad one, but too spicy for my taste. Opens with a very long lasting and very harsh gingery-peppery notes.

The base is the best part, the amber+oud combination is beautiful, but the strong myrrh not fit in the composation.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I don't know where these people came up with these notes at....
I get ZERO amber and ALOT of fresh spicy. I smell tons of nasty basil up-front along with ginger. Not a good combination whatsoever. At first you think it will be a nice scent (starts off smelling reminiscent of a bowl of Fruity Pebbles cereal), but then the basil and fresh spicy aspects take over and it smells totally different after about a minute or 2. I am selling my 98% full bottle because I have tried to give it time but I just can't enjoy it. The girlfriend has also stated she is ""really not a fan."" I bought this over the original which I smelled in Ulta, thinking it was similar and I don't think they are very close. This was a fail for me. I give it a 5.5/10 overall.",05/11/22 07:23,jturner333
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I write my reviews for my own future reference.

Opening was somewhat alcoholic, but underlying pepper and maybe ginger. After the initial opening I got a clear amber tone with warmth and the slightest, tiniest, note of spicy. I put the regular on my left arm and the intense on my right arm, and this one had character while the regular didn't have much to say. Not in longevity or silage but just in personality. Definitely if choosing between the regular and the intense, the intense is the way to go. At the same time I found the intense to monotone in its character, resonating a mostly Amber and slightly oily smell that I feel needs more to truly be what the name implies. Thought I would like this more, but left feeling uninspired.

Follow up: I'm blind testing this a few months later and the opening was not as alcoholic as recalled. It was more sweet, with tiny whiffs of banana, and the oily element made me think I pulled out a tropical leaning fragrance. As it dried down it leveled into a softer amber with a bit of spice. At the price point it offers something, beyond that not much.",05/01/22 07:11,dsgnmind
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"So, I came across this uninspected as they were a great deal and
I quite like the wording ""Euphoria"" so I go ahead blind buy.

Upon initial usage, It seems like I found another cheapie gem that I really like a lot, almost can say, love.
So, it shares characteristics of my other favorite fragrance YSL L'Homme without citrus.

It starts where YSL L'Homme left off with Cedar and Vetiver in the middle note.
It shares Warm Spices & Fresh spices like Ginger, Basil and Pepper.
and utilizing Amber and Patchouli to increase the stronger silicate and long-lasting.

I would say if YSL L'Homme decided to go down with the Amber route
instead of Lavender Aromatic you could probably get this one.

The first blast - I get a sweet smell tricked me to think of Watermelon but it is not a very fresh one.
I think it is because of the Amber + Fresh Spice.
when it starts to dry down the freshness is almost gone leaving the sweet smell with mild silvery woody aromatic.
It lingers in this phase for quite a while before turning into darker deeper smell of sweetness almost chocolatey.
However, when it becomes a skin scent it fails quite flat all it gives is mild dark mushy wood with a tint of sweetness.

Given the name intense, This works more like normal EDT.
Quite strong (6-7 hours + ) with moderate silicate (45 cm. from a person).

I see the versatility of use in a lot of cases.
It can become one of your staple or dumb reach easily if you like darker-sweet seductive woody spice aromatic fragrance.

It can be wared from Day to Night, Casual. It has a unique profile that reminds a of the smell in the modern day.
However, I would not choose this as a specific purpose frag

as Professional fragrance (a tad too sweet but workable).
Nor a Club frag (Too shy to announce but dark enough) or Summer frag (a bit too heavy, Ambery).

It fit a unique profile like the Casual & Day to Night scenario, workable in others but has much better options.
It will be given you a more refined youngster fun playful guy, a master of the plan. Alluring but still somewhat good.

In my honest opinion, I think it is quite worth a sniff.
Maybe you might get another budget-friendly frag.

Solid 8/10, like it a lot almost love it.

Edit 1 (Dec 16, 2022)

I write this review early on the journey, for now I feel like I start to fade away from this euphoria.

There is strong woody-amber here, the top is pretending to be sort of melon but I think it just strong Amber and some ingredients trick me to remind me melon.

I think the part I start to feel that it effected the fragrance the most in not a good way is Black basil like it's kinda have nasty smell to it.

I don't really know how actual oud smell like, but I realize I don't like the feel of wood in the dry down (I starts to know my taste that I prefers tonka, sandalwood, teakwood or vetiver).

It's so bazaar just a few months in the journey could change the way you smell a thing.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"There's nothing intense about this fragrance, the performance is less than acceptable. The scent is great though.",02/02/22 10:19,TurkiAlturki
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Euphoria Men Intense, the first male flanker of the Euphoria line, hit shelves in 2008 and its fragrance was also created by Carlos Benaim and Loc Dong, responsible for the fragrance of Euphoria Men, in 2006.
Euphoria Men Intense was released in Eau de Toilette concentration, which didn't take long to change in the fragrance industry, when stronger versions started to be produced in Eau de Parfum or, at least, Eau de Toilette Intense (which is when the percentage is on the limit to not be taxed as EDP).

I don't really know if the ghost of the makeover occurred, but my bottle dates back to 2011 and the performance was never completely unsatisfactory. I agree that taking into account the olfactory path of the fragrance – oriental-woody –, it was to be expected a greater trace. But Euphoria Men Intense had its highlight at that time, also because it was one of the first creations within the Designers segment to bring the OUD note in the composition when no one cared about such an ingredient, nor did it use its commercial value to embellish press releases.

The olfactory pyramid lists notes of ginger and pepper, the same rain accord as the previous version, and sudachi, which is a citrus fruit originating in Japan and is a hybrid version of tangerine, although it has a similar appearance to lime. Then, the central part brings notes of sage, cedar, and basil, while the base carries notes of amber, OUD, labdanum, patchouli, vetiver, and myrrh.

On the skin, Euphoria Men Intense tries to demonstrate kinship with the original version but is not very successful in this task. That's because, as soon as it touches the skin, the fragrance brings a spicy freshness that has similarities with the previous creation, indeed, but this moment is very ephemeral. In a matter of minutes, the sweeter side emerges and dominates the entire evolution. The sage is very evident, but the mix of amber and myrrh is unbeatable.

The more time passes, the more balsamic and resinous the fragrance becomes. We then have a warmer and more sensual smell, which for many starts to resemble a chocolate accord. And that's not unusual because we have OUD and patchouli together in the background.

Going back a few steps in the evaluations, I must say that when compared side by side (one in each arm, for example), the relationship and the way in which both fragrances evolve is very evident. However, when worn at different times (which is normal), there is the impression that the DNA was not respected in this intense version because the freshness of the ginger, basil, and pepper notes of one does not seem to exist in the other. And the truth is that it exists, but it is smothered by the ambery content that was employed here.

Revisiting the fragrance these days, I confess it was a good nighttime version for fans of the original. If you, by any chance, still have both versions in your collection, I invite you to take this comparative test. So, we look back and see that much of what was said and replicated was not 100% real, but the result of a recurrent prejudice with the fragrances of this brand, which still has good surprises in its portfolio.

Visually, Euphoria Men Intense came in an amber-colored bottle and the metallic finishing gained shades of a champagne color, which is not quite a bronze. After this, more flankers were released on the market.",01/03/22 12:02,Cassiano
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Calvin Kline, Intense Euphoria I like Calvin’s fragrances, back in the day he was one of the designers that you could depend on for a good quality fragrance. I loved Escape and original Eternity and today I love Eternity Flame, not as impressed with some of the other flankers in that line. So, here is my opinion on IE, first the bottle, not to impressive but from 3 feet it looks awesome, up close kind of cheesy but it’s the juice that counts. So this has a great opening, no huge alcohol blast, very pleasant, on me this morphs through many changes. It starts off a little spicy but not to much then it gets a little greener, and finally the woods kick in and the Oud is not animalic, it kind of goes in a sweeter direction, but pleasant not over the top sweet. On a 10 scale the opening is a solid 9, but overall I would give it q 7.5,",11/01/21 20:45,Napasonoma
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Very solid and refreshing offering from Calvin Klein. The ginger and pepper pairs well, aromatic and inviting opening. The cedar, sage, basil and vetiver in the middle is a combination that provides maturity with sensuality. Finally on the dry down the myrrh and labdanum add complexity and a bit of uniqueness. I think this is a crowd pleaser, can be dressed up or down. A bit mature, but not so much for someone in their mid-twenties like myself. Longevity could be better, but the projection is fine for the majority of its life. A cheapie that's as good as more expensive offerings. 7.5/10",10/30/21 06:34,RayCashhhh
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Really deep and natural smelling. Sweet but fresh, slightly aromatic, slightly herbal amber oriented fragrance. Consider layering l'occitane Eau De Baux with Boss Bottled.. But this one is much more transparent. Suprisingly high quality.

It would be among my favorites, if not for the relativelty weak performance.

But don't be discouraged, Dior Homme Parfum is my signature, so anything that I can't smell whole day is weak for me :) Performance of this will satisfy you if you like light, refreshing, and sweet fragrances.",09/06/21 15:10,Neyzen
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"This is an improvement on the original Euphoria and I like this very much. It performs well but it's not a monster. It smells sweet, a little powdery and a touch of woodiness to it too! This is a compliment getter that everyone come close to it will appreciate it. It's far from being offensive and overwhelming and I can be worn by anyone at anytime. I think it will perform better in the summertime. I give this a 7.5 out of 10 which is my par for the course when it come to Calvin Klein Fragrances as in most cases performance is average to slightly above average! A lovely scent though!!!",04/25/21 14:32,johnjubal1958
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"So I was really thoroughly surprised with this one. It has one of the best openings that I have come across from any of the cheaper designer brands, and even including some higher end designer brands this holds it's own. I also don't have any issues with performance as I've read on so many reviews below. I got a solid 7 to 9 hours every time I've worn it so far. I really, REALLY liked it the first time I wore it. I enjoyed it even more the second and third times I wore it. However, the last time I wore it, and I also experienced it just now while applying the fragrance, the artificial oud that's used in this can come across as body odor. And this last time it even started to give me a bit of a headache, and that's not a problem that I normally have with fragrances. Now I'm an oversprayer admittedly, and maybe that's why I picked up the body odor issue, because it's only during the first 20-30 minutes of wear that I pick it up. Everything smoothes out thereafter and on the whole I think this is a very solid fragrance that doesn't smell the least bit dated even though it's closing in on being 15 years old. Maybe it truly was ahead of it's time because if this were released today it would be above average, especially compared with most releases from the past year.",03/20/21 17:42,Djchildress
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"This is solid....

I wore the original euphoria for years back in the day. I’ve had it in my cart a number of times, but never pulled the trigger. Out of blue I found it at
A Burlington’s, $30. Had to grab...

Something in the opening reminds me of a lower
Quality Black Orchid. Just a slight resemblance...

This is pretty nice... Even if you liked the original,

It's not terrible, basically a CK version of a Lutens scent. I have an older bottle so perhaps it's different now. I got fairly good longevity with a couple sprays to the chest, but projection is not all that strong, though decent. This might be a good introduction to more interesting scents for a guy who has only worn fresh/sport type scents.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"This was my signature scent for a long time. It used to read a lot richer than it does now. Still, I received a lot of compliments on it.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"That one was my first love to Amber note (DG the one was my second) they are very similar in my opinion but this one is more fun and youthful it's ginger opening is so cheerful.. Kinda reminds me of that bubble gum sweetness trend in modern perfumery - acqua di giờ absolu for example -
But overall I love this one over the one, the ginger and patchouli add deepness and class to it.. And since both are mediocre performs then euphoria is a winner for me

Also.. How the hell do u smell oud in that guys?? 😄",09/25/20 18:39,Rated_mo
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"A fresh spicy scent with a sophisticated, mild, fruity sweetness.

The spiciness is that of black pepper, ginger, & basil. A bit sharp, a bit herbal.

The fruity sweetness smells like a woody mango accord. I believe that is the amber-ginger friendship here.

As it dries down, you are left with a woody spicy (minty) scent with a touch of ambery sweetness. It reminds me a lot of Hugo's Just Different, despite the different notes. Like one could be a flanker of the other. A lot will find it redundant to own both.

And yet again, no oud. Zero. Yet, it is still voted as the top 3 note. Not the first fragrance to suffer from this, not the last. A lot of people on this website vote for notes they do not know how they smell. Do not try Euphoria for the oud because it does not exist here.

Back to the fragrance. Bluntly saying it, you don't think of Calvin Klein fragrances when you think of sophistication. They smell nice but are not formal event scents..

..Euphoria Intense is the exception to that rule.

Still, like all of Calvin Klein's, this suffer performance-wise, despite the ""Intense"" label. You'd get ~2-3 hours of decent projection, then it is a skin scent for a few more hours.

The scent is versatile but cool nights seem to be its ideal time.

Euphoria Intense remains a very good scent at a very affordable price, that is worth trying.

""Love""",06/16/20 18:44,AMajeedQT
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I think that slapping the 'intense' label on this fragrance is quite misleading. In my opinion, this is not a super-powered version of the original with better longevity and sillage; this is an entirely new fragrance altogether.

Euphoria Men was a fresh/spicy fragrance with a wake-up call of ginger and pepper in the opening, that dried down to a subtle woody scent with a touch of suede. Intense Euphoria Men
is different. Very different.

It opens with a scent that can best be described as a mix of rich, earthy soil and dark chocolate. As things progress, it heats up and turns into a cup of hot chocolate made of only the finest quality ingredients, with an undertone of dark woods. The wonderful thing about this fragrance
is that it doesn't come off as very sweet or cloying, and never enters gourmand territory.

The more I smell this, the more I like it. Intense Euphoria Men is without a doubt a hidden gem in the fragrance community, and one of the best that Calvin Klein has to offer.",06/07/20 13:43,LukeS

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Intense Euphoria for Men is a very fun, mature, dark, and sensual fragrance.

Opening: Unique blast of watermelon for the first half hour with minimal musk

Drydown: This is where EI shines! A beautiful gourmand sweetness shines through. It smells like strawberries covered in dark chocolate- a combination which many women will love! The sweetness is noticeable but not overpowering, as there are woody accords and strong musk to balance it out

Performance: Performs strongly for the first 1-2 hours and then sits closer to skin. Not bad performance, but not the best. Will ultimately be decided by your skin type.

OVERALL: This is a very dark, yet sweet inviting fragrance that is unique. It is for anyone who has grown tired of fresh/citrusy fragrances and needs something darker and muskier, but sweet as well. 8/10",06/27/19 12:52,FragranceTester9292
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I can appreciate other who like this, but sadly I feel a little let down by the positive reviews, considering I just blind bought this today because of them. It was between the original and intense version, and the reviewer below me suggested that this was the better smelling version. I can’t attest to smelling the original but I will tell you what disappoints me. The opening smell is great as with most Calvin Klein scents, but I could tell right away that this was going to have performance issues as after 10 sprays and 20 minutes later it wasn’t radiating, it was sitting too close to my skin, almost a skin scent by 30 minutes. What makes me slightly salty is that I overpaid for this at a department store. I paid 65$ and I later found that I could have gotten it for half price on one of my favourite online cologne stores, lesson learned. It’s opening is fruity, and slightly boozy to my nose, almost like Encounter by CK, minus the rum. It’s slightly sweet, and I appreciate the honey in this. I was expecting to smell the oud, but I don’t pick up any at all. I thought maybe I was suffering olfactory fatigue but I had my gf smell me and she could barely smell it also. And to all of the Calvin Klein white knights that will defend this and come back at me about scents smelling stronger on other people’s skin and PH stuff, I lent the bottle out to 3 other friends and ALL of them said the same thing (30 minutes, and then a skin scent. To the folks saying in their reviews that the performance in this is great, please try and be mindful of others who are looking for a new blind buy, your reviews need to be responsible and should try to avoid exaggerating scents. It’s more my fault though because I didn’t go deep enough in the reviews, some of you told it straight. This gets a 4/10 for me. Just below average. This is a shame too... As I love CK scents and praise a lot of them.",06/24/19 20:21,DaedalusX
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I own both Euphoria and now Intense Euphoria and judging by the opening this blows the original out of the water.

Both are good in my opinion and this one is for sure an intense version to the original. This one is sweeter in the opening, overall darker and lasts longer. This would be great for date nights and for attracting women. I give this a 9.3/10",06/09/19 07:42,Criglett Clussnum
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"As many have mentioned, there is a little bit of a watermelon vibe at the start. It's sweet and there's noticeable amber and ginger. As it dries down, the woody notes intensify and a sort of fruity/chocolate vibe develops. It's a very nice scent and in my opinion, can be worn in all climates and settings.

On my skin, sillage and longevity leave a bit to be desired. Smells good and strong for about 30 minutes and then fades. After about 2-3 hours, it's barely detectable. Improved sillage and longevity would make this fragrance even better.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Euphoria Men- Intense is a very good dark masculine sexy scent.

The opening is a lot of watermelon, but the dry down (after the first 20 mins) is where this shines.

The dry down transforms the scent into a dark, chocolate-covered strawberry scent. Ladies love this! It is sweet but very masculine because of the dark warm scent that accompanies the sweetness.

Everyone's skin chemistry is different. On me the longevity is good as is the projection. On others it may be great, while others only may get decent longevity and projection.

The ideal time to wear is fall/winter. The ideal occasions are a night out/casual times. But if your outfit and mood need it, this can be worn at any occasion/time.

Upon dry down it becomes a warm spicy amber scent, with a sweetness that's not too pronounced, unless you over spray. I think the ginger adds balance to prevent it from being cloying.

I love the bottle design!

Nice scent and incredibly cheap. Not my style, so I wouldn't repeat buy, but I'll definitely use up the bottle.",09/22/17 05:07,Hastey

Scent 4/10",08/24/17 09:05,ABATE
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"This is a nice scent, its got one of the best openings I have in my collection, this probably makes it popular with people when sprayed on the skin/tester in store.

Rich spicy opening with a fruit underlay, its dark, peppery & dense and I can clearly detect chocolate. Reminds me of a more refined Angel Pure Havane,which I love.

Typically with every CK scent I have tried or owned, the performance is lousy! It seems CK are getting something fudamentally wrong with all their scents in this regard. I haven't come across one (admittedly I haven't tried all of them) which is mildly detectable later in the day either on the skin or clothing. If memory serves the original Euphoria performed better than this one? I last own the original when it was released.

I can't understand why a brand like Chanel for example, athough not cheap, (I tend to think of Chanel as a gold standard, like a Longines or Omega watch) can produce frags that consistently perform well, Chanel only have a reasonably small line up of popular mens' high street frags and everyone one of them performs exceptionally, so reformulation agruments just don't hold up. I just wish CK could follow this example with their more mature frags such as some of the Euphoria line, I wouldn't mind paying more if they performed well.

Love the bottle especially in a 100ml, chunky, pale bronze metal rimmed cognac coloured glass, heavy and substantial in the hand. Still one of the best bottles on the market.

CK obviously have some great perfumers under their employ. Perhaps CK are happy making most of their money from the abundance of CK citrus scented water frags so popular amongst young people; CK One & Be and their countless variations.

Apart from CK Euphoria Liquid Gold, which I still want to try and will probably never get hold of now, this may be one of the last CK frags I try again.

Sublime scent ruined by zero performance....what a shame!!",07/26/17 13:52,MaxRenn

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I wanted to like this one so bad! I bought this as a gift for my BF after smelling it in store. At the time I thought it reminded me of sushi and I was into it. The ginger notes were strong and it felt very unique. CK is one of my go-to brands and I enjoy their particular style of American Minimalism. But at home, Euphoria Men Intense smells kind of generic. I don't know what happened!

On me, it smells sweet and spicy. Almost like a spiced pear. I was surprised there are no fruit notes listed, as there is a cool and cucumbery element that reminds me of apple or a watery, fresh fruit. I think the reason it seems so run-of-the-mill is the notes list isn't out of the ordinary. Many of the components are found in other popular men's fragrances, and the way they combine is sort of standard. That doesn't mean Euphoria Men Intense is poorly made, as it's actually pleasant and not as obtrusive as men's fragrances usually are. It feels modern and cool, and very on-brand for CK. But there is something missing here from making it truly great.

The bottle design is minimalist and not trying to be a car part or anything silly that companies dream up when they try to make it appealing to men (like a gaudy gold bar, for instance). But, my arch nemesis Labdanum is present in this fragrance, and as a result, it isn't something I want to wear. Which is unfortunate, as my BF doesn't wear it either. A lesson in buying fragrances for other people!

Even if I can't seem to force myself to enjoy this scent, it is not without its use. This is a perfect cologne for men who want something to wear to the office or date night. It could easily be a staple or signature and is no doubt appealing to a wide variety of people. It's not trying to be overtly sexy or masculine. It's just there, a little extra piece to complete the puzzle.",01/18/17 20:54,EnergeticCrab
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"This was another gift I received. I hadn't had much experience with this one until recently and I must say, I do like it. Upon first application I find it's a strong woody/fruity combination. I think what gives it this fruity characteristic is the amber and ginger combination. At the price point, this is a great fragrance. Performance is ok. I got this in a gift set with the aftershave. You can forget about the longevity on the aftershave. It's like 30 minutes.

Actually, I just got a compliment on this as I'm writing this. A female co-worker just walked into my office and said, ""It smells so good in here!"". The scent and the price are great, the performance is average. Nothing but good things to say about this stuff.",12/13/16 06:51,D-Bo
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I can see how people could like this and at first sniff this seemed promising but sadly it just didn't impress me or even persuade me to use this a dumb reach.

It starts out kind of fresh,slightly spicy and sweet and isn't great but kind of nice but once it dries down it kind of reminds me rotten fruit with spices. Again, it's not horrible but it's certainly not great and my girlfriend did NOT like this. ( but to be fair she hates most of my frags and is into fresher scents)

Performance was decent.... it projects really well for 30 minutes (with 3 sprays) but quickly dies down to pretty much a skin scent. It does however last 6-10 hours so this might work as a good work scent if it works with your skin chemistry.

Overall rating--- 6 out of 10 ! An ok scent with decent performance and this is super cheap now days so that's also a redeeming factor.",10/18/16 10:08,Ryanmmas26
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"CK's Euphoria Intense is an underrated gem.

CKEI smells absolutely brilliant: I get Amber, Ginger, Patchouli, and it smells really smooth. Mostly Amber.

Performance is an issue and it lasts about 6 hours for me with so-so projection.

With that said, you will definitely get compliments in the first few hours. Everybody likes the smell of this one.

Maybe I want a blast of strawberry smell in the morning to wake me up or to energize me, I don't know but I have grown to really like it now.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein Euphoria Men Intense is actually one of the only fresh spicy blind buys of late that I intend on keeping. Intense, Gold, and Essence each seem to be reasonably popular and now reasonably-priced, so this is the first one I got my hands on.

The fresh spicy characterization is accurate---Euphoria Men Intense's spiciness can probably be most attributed to pepper but I don't get much pepper (or much overwhelming spiciness) at all from this, as it's mostly subdued next to a woody/sweet mix that seemingly involves some sandalwood or cedar with a synthetic fruit (perhaps cherry) vibe. In that respect, it ends up seemingly like a distant relative to CK One Shock, but not nearly as well-blended.

Projection and longevity are nothing special, but at its price ($32 for 100ml on FragranceNet), it's hard to complain.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I tried this the other day, it smelled good actually. Not my type of scent, to me it is somewhat feminine. It smells expensive. But for an intense version this is very faint to my nose. It reminds me of Paco Rabanne Invictus, the same sweetness. Mostly in the beginning, then they go their both ways. Invictus gets airy and summery, this one gets autumny and sweeter.",11/07/15 08:52,Unmodernize
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I forgot this old friend of mine.I bought this long time ago when it was first came in the market but after a short period of time i have broken one of it by mistake.I remember euphoria was extremely loud and on my skin could last for more than 8 hours.The reviewers have mentioned that Euphoria Intense doesn't hold long!Maybe the producer has changed the composition and toned down the strenght but i'm not sure about it, cause i have never tried the new version.I'm eager to try this one more time.

Euphoria intense catches for sure the attention and provokes compliments.I have also received many compliments from both women and men.Euphoria is extremely sweet,fresh due to the ginger note and above all resinous and dark because of Oud and amber.The Oud note is artistically blended in this composition and projects in a different way ,in comparison with this one of M7 from YSL, take for instance.From my point of view EI is completely underrated and underestimated because it couldn't beat in Strenght others of this Oud-Genre like M7,Oud by killian ,Tom Ford's Oud Wood etc....Euphoria stays somewhere between the typical Oud compositions and the modern.

All in all another success story from the fashion design house of Calvin Klein.Very good job!",10/03/15 23:07,alexiou
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"After long reflection, I decided to renew my perfume Euphoria with Euphoria Intense. They expected the tribute justified. I needed something fresh and different, because I like the brand Calvin Klein. My disappointment intens to start by saying that my girlfriend does not like it. In fact, very few women like this fragrance. In men is different - more like it. The initial feeling of freshness is mixed with soft touches, but after about 1 hour of my skin remains only the smell of smoke. I will try with Euphoria Gold Fluid. Although Euphoria is the same series Euphoria is totally different from Euphoria Intense.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Anyone who says this has poor longevity probably isn't detecting some of the aroma chemicals in it. One spray to the chest lasted at least 17 hours for me! I like this one but in some ways it's ""anti-niche,"" meaning that the notes are blended tightly and there isn't a lot of depth. However, there is just enough depth to the drydown and the smell itself is really good, though if someone were to say it's a bit ""synthetic"" I wouldn't argue the point. For a designer scent that is selling now for around $35 per 100 ml new, what's not to like? The original was too fruity for me, and was also too ""synthetic"" to my nose, but this one may be in my rotation for a long time to come. Note that the sillage seems to come in wafts, and it may be best not to try and make it stronger by spraying more, because then I'd guess it would be too ""synthetic.""",07/23/15 13:29,Bigsly

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Euphoria Intense is an interesting scent that I’m glad I added to my collection. There was a bit of back and forth between whether or not I wanted this fragrance. I told myself if I found it cheap enough, I would get it. I found it at TJMaxx for $29 for a 3.7oz bottle.

First Impressions: My first impression is that it was overwhelmingly spicy. When I first sprayed this from a tester onto a paper strip I literally said “yuck” aloud. As I continued sampling other scents, I went back to the paper strip and actually liked what I smelled. Before I left, I sprayed a shot on each wrist.

I was immediately met with that overwhelming spicy scent. Once again, I was back to “yuck.” After about 30 minutes is when the true beauty of Euphoria Intense begins to shine.

Mid/late notes: After the extreme spicy smell dissipates, I am left with a great smell on my skin. Rather than trying to dissect the pyramid of notes, I can best describe it as a dark chocolate cherry smell with a peppery kick. After an hour or two I start to get a bit of an unexpected clean/fresh scent that really evens things out.

Spray Count: Before I jump into my projection/longevity ratings, I think it is only fair to mention the spray count. I go pretty heavy with this one. I usually to 6-8 body sprays and possibly a few on my clothes depending on what I’m wearing and how long I will be out and about.

Projection: I feel like Euphoria Intense projects fairly well. There are times when I feel like the smell has dissipated, only to be smacked in the nose with a reminder that it is still very much alive. I do feel that the projection goes down quite a bit after a while. After about 5 hours, it becomes a skin scent that can only be detected within my personal/intimate space. However, it is very much still there! Also keep in mind that my olfactory sensory neurons seem to adapt faster than the average nose. I would give the projection a well above average rating of 8/10.

Longevity: Euphoria Intense seems to last a long time on my skin. I can come home from a 12 hour day and still faintly detect it on my wrist and forearm. It’s one of the few fragrances that I can detect making transitions throughout the day. I am actually wearing it right now and I can smell a difference on me from just a couple hours ago when I arrived in the office. Overall, I give longevity an 8/10.

Compliments: Unfortunately, this is where this cologne sort of falters. I haven’t really gotten a ton of compliments with Euphoria Intense. As a matter of fact, my wife hates it. She always makes a face when I wear it. To be fair, she only smells it when I first spray it and I’m already on the road when it start transitioning to my favorite notes. I shall also note that my wife is a big fan of the fresh/clean/aquatic scents, so there is some bias. I do get compliments from time-to-time, but not as much as other, and not as much as I expect.

I will mention that I let a friend borrow this for a date. He said that his date loved it and he also got a couple compliments from strangers. I know he is a heavy sprayer (this is coming from someone that sprays this scent about 8 times) so that may have something to do with it.

On the compliment factor I give Euphoria Intense a 6/10

Usage: This immediately jumps out as a perfect fall and winter fragrance. I would also use this on a dinner date (if only my wife liked it as much as I do). Since my wife isn’t a huge fan, I usually stick to wearing this around the office. It seems to be a perfect fit.

Overall: I think Euphoria Intense is a great surprise from Calvin Klein. It is definitely one of my favorites from them. Just remember to try and get passed the initial aggressiveness of this fragrance if it comes across as a “spicy mess.” I am glad that I gave it a second chance. I’m even happier that I found it at a discount. I’m not sure if I would pay full retail price for this at a department store. However, I am proud to have this as part of my collection. My overall score is a 7.5/10",02/03/15 11:40,Monte84
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Just received my first bottle of Euphoria Intense this morning !

first impression :

Scent : 9/10 , lovely scent by CK, for me.. it's the best fragrance from CK's house till now. nice amber opening with slight note of gingery vibe there (in a positive way)

Mature yet sweet but not to sweet at the same time. superb !

Longevity : 8/10 , still easily can smell the notes on my skin (6hours ++)

Silage : 9/10 , soft yet so sophisticated. I mean, this might offend other people if you use it during funeral event / any other event that requires ""calm"" surrounding. so use it wisely :D

overall : 8.6 ! that's an A in college.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"As many of you may know, I do average joe type reviews with no commentary on notes. So here it is, spray_and_pray's review of Euphoria Intense:

So I bought this at TJ Maxx tonight in a gift set that included a 3.4oz bottle of juice and a bottle of after shave. I paid $40 something for the kit. A higher price range than usual for a blind buy, but I like living on the edge sometimes. I sprayed two sprays and this juice definitely reminds me of Curves Appeal Pour Homme. I think Euphoria is more refined.

It also has more bang for your buck compared to Curves Appeal. The first two sprays project of the skin pretty decently. I'd say more than a foot of projection. Euphoria Intense projects good give or take 2 hours, then it wears down to about 4-6 inch projection. After 3 hours, it becomes a subtle skin scent. The scent is so amazing though, I am not upset with two good hours of projection honestly. Call me crazy, but this is one of the only juices I would deal with re-applying to maintain this scent. It is goddamn good. At the same time, I would not pay full retail. If you can find a deal on this for $45 or less, then grab it up.

Scent: 5/5
Performance: 2/5
Cost: Not going to rate, it depends on your budget.",12/21/14 00:10,spray_and_pray
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Euphoria Intense has been a pleasant surprise. I bought it on impulse when I saw it cheap on sale online without too many expectations but oh Boy!! It is pretty darn good. Starts off very fruity ( there are no fruit notes listed but I get a watermelon like note, no idea what's happening there) and then the Amber comes in. It has a kind of Oud note in the dry down but does not smell like real oud, some kind of synthetic note so dont get this looking for an oud frag. Overall I would call it a fruity Amber fragrance with hints of spices and it's really nice in cold weather. Stays strong for about 5-6 hours and probably lasts a bit longer as my clothes were still smelling of it the next morning after a night out. Probably would work best as a night out/ clubbing frag for autumn/winter. it's too playfully cheerful for the office or formal occasions for me but you could definitely rock just about any night out with this. I love it. 8/10",12/05/14 07:24,kanak

In my opinion the scent conveys the following:

Perfect for evening wear, and night-dates. I wouldn't recommend using it daily (or during daytime)'coz it may offend other people.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Got a sample of this from Sephora simply because I had never seen it before. I had NO IDEA this fragrance would be so creative, quirky, playful, sexy, seductive, unique, and quite literally... outstanding. It lasts for at least 12 hours, and its projection is perfect. Oddly enough, upon very first spray it smells rather generic (I'm glad I never spritzed this on paper), but then, moments later, the wearer is treated to a deep, intense marriage of chocolate-coated strawberries, tropical melon and yes, perhaps... even peaches; all with a woody, masculine, delightfully restrained spiciness lying beneath. This is the scent of seduction. And YES, it IS quite euphoric.

Overall: 9/10

Truly a diamond in the rough and a rare, hidden gem in designer perfumery. Far and away Calvin Klein's best ""male"" offering, and a unique and special treat for the wearer as well as those around him... or her. I'm so glad my fiancé picked a bottle of this up for me for our anniversary yesterday. We've both adore it, just not nearly as much we adore each other. :)",05/28/14 21:17,Smyle12
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Smells very good. A spicy dried-fruit scent that isn't overwhelming and tart, but rather subtly sweet and comforting. Unfortunately, it's relatively weak in terms of projection/sillage. I can douse myself with 6-8 sprays, and it doesn't seem to get picked up by others. I will say, the longevity is pretty good; you can detect hints of it on your neck for the whole day.

Good for a subtle, inoffensive perfume that you can wear on a regular basis without knocking people out around you.

Carelessly draped at the edge of the bed is a little black dress, and a pair of stockings thrown over the lamp.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Wonderful fragrance! It's sweet and lush without being overbearing. Longevity and sillage is great for me but then again I love overspraying on clothing. Give at least ten sprays of this on your clothes and you'll be good to go! Beautiful bottle too!

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"When it boils down to it, I wear this cologne very often. Mainly because you can find this extremly cheap and i dont waqnt to wear the good stuff, butit does have a nice smell to it but its really not my taste and honestly when i first got this cologne i thought since it was the intense version i only needed two-three sprays. WRONG, i have to put on a rediculous ammount just to be smellable in the next 4-5 hours.

Even though i really dont like it, those who do smell it LOVE it and the REALLY good thing is, ONLY WOMEN LIKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! So if any guys are wanting to go on a date, ;);) you know what to grab for:)",12/20/13 10:03,Mrbigbigtoe

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I have to say I love this. It is a notch up from the original, both in quality and in depth. There are those who probably reach for the myrrh, ambergris, labdanum, and oud in this... and there are those who probably relate to it as Cherry Chapstick. No matter. I think the more you wear it and get to know it, the more you discover its depth. It's a great everyday go-to when my favorites would seem a little too heady.",11/27/13 14:37,GoodVibrations
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I haven't really been interested in Calvin Klein fragrances since my teen years.
Occasionally I sniff the new stuff that comes out, some I like and some not, but none have prompted me to purchase until Euphoria Intense came out.

I think it's a good intro to the world of OUD fragrances for all age groups, without the intensity, smokiness and heaviness of most of Oud based scents that are out there.

Euphoria manages to be fresh and lightly sweet/woody, with some of the exotic spice that you want in an Oriental composition. But it's easier to wear at school, work, or out on the town, without overwhelming people you come in contact with.

I personally love heavy oriental scents that scare people, but I don't always wanna be that guy, so Euphoria is a nice, in-expensive and less-offensive alternative.",11/24/13 10:56,robg303
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,I do not really know how to describe the notes on this bottle. But what can I assure is the smell almost are exactly like the fragrance counter.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Out of Ck's fall/winter frags, I have to give Euphoria Intense a very high rating. This frag will join the classic's being a PHENOMENAL juice. Out of all the different notes that I pick up, OUD is the first one I can detect a real woodsy base. The frag has a smokey aroma which awakens your senses to the dif notes you can smell.
Euphoria evokes a mystical enchanting far east aroma with ginger, pepper also blended with sage, amber and myrrh giving it a real balmy warm/spicy scent.

Longevity, if you spray it twice your good for 8-10hrs.
Sillage is just enough that you can smell it about 1ft away without it being heavy.

Overall opinion,
I have several real spicy frag's when I want to wear it for evening or to attract someone's attention.
Euphoria Intense is now part of main frag's I will use. It has a unique blend with a smokey/woodsy blend and layered with a warm/spicy notes.
OUD attracts attention being a VERY SOPHISTICATED aroma. I have had several women complement me on this AMAZING FRAGRANCE.
I found that this frag has a touch of sweet scent from labdanum/myrrh which women enjoy the aroma. After several hours you can still pick up the aroma.
In my book, this is a no brainer...perfect from late fall/winter....10/10

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"A warm cosy, yet light frag, which although not complex, is perhaps hard not too like...

I applied 6 heavy sprays

0- 20 mins - 10 inch projection. The pale oud and amber appears to me as a light cocoa with a balmy edge with a slight ginger twist. It's simple and nice, yet not complex. Ages 26 - 36. Winter and snug, loveable and fair, cute n cuddly...

20 mins - 1.25 hours - 5 inch projection. Linear

1.25 hours - 3.75 hours. 2 inch projection. Some patchoulli comes in, but it is very light

3.75 hours - 6 hours. Close to skin. Pleasant, some soapiness on the skin at the end

Its a nice frag, though I wouldn't buy

Good name and bottle, but not intense or strong in any way

Safe bet",06/29/13 13:16,ChristopherRiley
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"This is a mysterious perfume I think, a lot of different notes in the dry down as It evolves, I think the Patchouli and amber work really well and I like that the pepper smell isn't dominant because a lot of males perfumes have a very peppery smell and I don't find that very attractive where as this is the complete opposite. A big thumbs up for me its different refreshing and has a deep scent that continues to evolve. Each note does its part in contributing to this CK fragrance.",06/05/13 04:55,RaggaGirl
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I detect oud in this, but it's very toned down. It has no rotten/barnyard quality (which I actually happen to like). Just adds some woodiness.

Both Euphoria and Euphoria Intense are lovely. The latter one is heavier, and therefore, more suitable for cold seasons. I think it is a perfume for all occasions, for office wear, for evening waer, etc., and for all edges. I beleive that both young and mature men would love this perfume. This is a very spicy perfume but it does not disturb you at all, no matter how much you wear. I really love it!

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"So a lot of things has been said about this juice. I can only give my opinion to my surroundings and experiences in regard to it.

My first experience was when just browsing some scents in a store with a friend. I asked her to smell a few card and give her opinion. The first few she smelt and wasn't overly excited about. When she hit this one her eyes lit up and she told me to get this. A few months later I did manage to get it and I haven't looked back since.

To me this a magical fragrance that captures something in women that still surprises me every time. I've asked a few ladies of varying ages 19-45 what they have thought if it and the replies I have make me smile and laugh all the time. ""You smell delicious"", ""i can stand here smelling you all day"" was from my boss, she never compliments my smell and she wanted a bottle for her husband. My fav one was a one word answer from a lesbian ""f*ck"".

It's a powerhouse of a fragrance it lasts all night when I take it out, lots of compliments, and it has never failed me. Only downside is when it's really hot it will evaporate pretty quick. 10/10 for me.",09/25/12 02:19,Mannie
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,I tested this again today and I decided that it is too sweet for me. It kind of reminded me of V&R Spicebomb with the pepper and cedar. I own Spicebomb and this was too simular in the dry down.,09/08/12 12:03,LuckyStar1
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I love Euphoria for Women. I reeks sensual sex!

Euphoria Men Intense is good but not great. This is not Euphoria Men on steroids despite the name (Intense my ass!). Not really an improvement but more a sideways move.

Trying to put my finger on it, but the overall impression seems lacking. Fooling you to believe a thrill awaits but it never quite delivers on the promise. Also, quality feels out of line with the price (should be knocked down a couple Andrew Jackson's).

Yes, I understand where some find the opening a tad sweet but don't let that put you off. This is not girly like. This is Calvin manly (but not in a boorish macho way). Patchouli and amber in the base give it some heft.

Since my method of application is pretty constant throughout the day, I've found the best app method to be neck, wrists, shirt while I'm outside in the open air, and that sticks pretty well as a base coverage. If I reapply during the day I spray twice down inside my shirt and the shirt holds back all of the strength and let's emminate the flavor on a much softer level, so not to kill people around me.",03/15/12 16:38,Mushroomfat

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Of this juice, I am a big fan. Captivating, it is.

Sweet? Very.

Too sweet? Not by a long shot.

To my mind it brings a clean, fresh, light breezy scent that feels subtle but not diluted.

With time the sweetness mellows and I feel that the scent gets more complex and decidedly more masculine. My wife LOVES chocolate, so I was pleasantly surprised when a few hours in I caught a whiff of chocolate. Yes!! I'm going right after her pleasure triggers!! If your significant other likes chocolate...go get this, they will love how you smell but most likely wont be able to tell you why. Have fun...LOL.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"It's funny - I got into fragrance years ago...it's amazing where taste goes. I bought this and wore it a few times and thought - wow, this is definitely ""Intense"" and very sweet. It was on blind recommendation - I actually don't wear current CK scents (only Vintage of the classic originals), as I find them too mainstream and mass-marketed synthetic juice, typically. My wife and I actually use a couple of their feminine scents as room freshener (not kidding, but LOL any way). I got this for a steal (under $25), as I went off a lot of very positive reviews. No offense, but this is high-school/college and maybe up to 30 party wear that lasts only a couple of hours. Probably not long enough to get a girl into bed - and then you smell like a sweaty candied frat guy who has no freakin' taste.

It's a rainy day and I went for a massage today. It grabbed the corner of my eye and I put some on for the first time in 18 months - 2 years. I paused and laughed. Someone on here mentioned it smelled like strawberry syrup ice cream. I get their point - before reading that and coming on here, I said...""I smell like a stack of blueberry pancakes covered in strawberry and maple syrup!"" This is NOT an oriental woody! This is, at its closest, a gourmand - but sickly sweet and cloying as hell. I would actually like to refrain from saying anything too negative, because for about two hours, I was smelling very sweet...too much for me, but others liked it. Go figure.

Personally, I wear scents for me - not other people. If I offend you with an 80's powerhouse fougere that has a rich oakmoss note, that is your olfactory issue, not mine. This would work fine for the cast of Jersey Shore - or anyone who wants to be like them or have sexual relations with them. I don't - they are obnoxious. I can only imagine how they must all smell together after getting ready for another night out at the clubs that they've already shared bodily fluids with all the rest of the people who you will see them with. I think I found what that smell is...

And, for those of you, learn something about fragrance before making comments on olfactory notes. There is NO ACTUAL Oud in here - this is all synthesized juice and syrup. Get real people. I buy my wife Oud essential oils from the Middle East that are infused with only complimentary notes - rose oil, jasmine oil, etc. I will only wear this again to make fun of myself or the people I am hanging out with.

My rating is a metaphor - I give this One syrup-smeared Snooki swingin' around in a sex sling over 10 drunk guys from Jersey who want to get inside her panties.",01/20/12 12:45,ericrico

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Just have one spray on my wrist an hour ago, and all I can say is how similar it is to Thierry Mugler A*Men with the strong herbal but sweet oriental-like patchouli. It is not as sweet and strong as A*Men. As a result, Euphoria Intense is more wearable but also doesn't seem to last as long. I feel like it won't last more than 4 hours on me as it already begin to fade. However, it seem to get a bit powdery too. Way to attract women, I think!

Euphoria Intense is not spicy nor really woody. It is a rich, heavy, alluring sexy, and definitely sweet. It is not so generic, and it requires some getting used to. Oh I don't recommend this as a gift or blind purchase. Try it first!",08/09/11 17:13,nattonline

Its the sexier brother of the original euphoria which IMHO is a day scent aimed for office executives. I applaud the tinted amber bottle design which creates an aura of the mystery man. The befuddling effect it has on ladies continues to baffle me.

The opening notes remind you of blissfully sweet & rich fruity muskmelon with subtle spicy tones that captivate your senses. The dry down is pleasantly woody and dark chocolate. It may appear very sweet but it is not at all feminine. Don't douse yourself with it though.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Euphoria Intense is oh, so manly! What else could one possibly expect from such an array of rich, woodsy and masculine fragrance notes in such an alluring, cube-shaped bottle.

Euphoria was one of the first male fragrances I tried and for many years it held a strong place in my top scents for men. Euphoria Intense has surpassed the original by far, bringing with it bolder accords and a hell of a lot more sexiness.

I was immediately struck by all the pepper, woods and resinous oud that wafted so beautifully around me. It is the scent of a man, a man that is conscious of smelling good that is. Despite being clean-cut and well-dressed, there's that underlying sense that he doesn't mind getting down and dirty every now and then.

There's subtle hints of spice and soapiness that immerge occasionally throughout the composition, that are somewhat dark and arousing. There is also a strange sweetness, possibly the ginger and basil, that give this fragrance a delicious yet masculine feel.

Euphoria Intense is a great fragrance for men in the way it is absolutely captivating to the opposite sex. It makes a man appear mysterious, charming and classy. The sillage and longevity are certainly better than the original Euphoria and everything about it seems to be drawing me in. I'm actually craving a man right now so I can douse him in the stuff.",04/17/11 06:14,missk

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"WOW!!! Gobsmacking scent, instantly beautiful.
If you're unsure of Euphoria due to the low silage or projection, go for Euphoria Intense.
The first spray immediately has the ginger bringing out the absolute sweetest any of these notes can offer, the first 30 seconds I relate to Jo Malones Pomegranate Noir, it smells nothing like PN but it very quickly cools to a still very sweet and exotic, oud/floral intensity.

Scents like Eternity and Crave had me losing faith in old Calvin's taste and outlook, but Euphoria intense is one of his better releases. Much stronger than CAlvin's normal creations.

Although not completely out of the box, this scent is very unique to me despite my hundreds of tests, I'm so glad an Intense version was made for Euphoria!

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Not a bad fragrance, but has poor longevity even thought it is INTENSE. But I don't expect much from Calvin Klein's fragrances they are just names on different, interesting bottles. If you need lasting stuff, look at Carolina Herrera, Jean Paul Gaultier, Dior and even Paco Rabanne.
This smelled like a woman's perfume on me after less than an hour. Lasted for 2-2:30 hours at the most.
The best part on me was in the very beginning and then it started changing and I don't like it. At least I didn't buy it but I sprayed a whole lot of it on me at the mall. So this is how I know. It does not have good silage and projection is a little bit below average.
I hope I don't regret what I'm saying but I think I'm never going to buy a Calvin Klein cologne again. I just got MAN by Calvin Klein and lacks of longevity, projection and silage, I really hope it will be better in the hotter days! I don't want my money to be wasted.",04/03/11 09:28,Raptole

Along with YSL M7, Euphoria Men Intense is the only option for those who want to enjoy these exotic earthy tones only Oud oil offers without spending a small fortune on a bottle of perfume.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,Hello. Could anybody tell me what difference there is between this one and the traditional Euphoria? Is this one similar in any way to the version pour femme?,10/01/10 15:08,raverdudes

That you are an ignorant person doesn´t make the rest of the world ignorant,How older are you? 14? 13?...please dont insult people. if you dont know anything mentioned here, do what you and everybody should : LEARN belive me is the only cure for ignorance.",09/18/10 23:05,Lotofire
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Like my review for Versace Dreamer, my only relationship with Intense is clear : I wear her, she advertises me.. Neither love or hate her, it's a deal. Definitely 100 times better than its original trashy scented water, I still don't get why women go crazy on this one. They tell me this is ten times better than Versace pour homme for example, which I find impossible to believe...

Sillage : good
Longevity : 3+ hours (poor for an intense edition)
Feeling : hot!!
Feedback : people like to be around you
Recommendation : A Winner",09/09/10 05:21,scentology
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Yes, it does last longer than the original Euphoria, but it is ways different from the original Euphoria. It start with ginger and spicy peppery scent, minutes later, it turn to something very dry, thick and oriental scent for hours, it kind of too intense until I get light migraine wearing it (kind of remind me Davidoff Silver Shadow). Dry down is mild woody scent.

Original Euphoria smell smoother, more sexy and less aggressive than this one.

Both of them are totally 2 different group of scent, choose wisely. I will give 5/10 for this as I prefer the original Euphoria a lot more.",07/25/10 07:23,bwcw81
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"This is way much better than the original. Richer, more spicey, and more depth. And I love the darker bottle, looks much more luxurious!",07/18/10 12:16,Lance
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"The sales lady said to me that it smells like ""dark chocolate"", and so I bought it even though hadn't smelled it as wanted a new scent.

I really like it, it does remind me of dark chocolate actually.... and if you've smelled that Lynx Dark Temptation chocolatey spray stuff, they are very very similar.

It's pretty masculine, but sweet-ish and heavy, great for autumnal or wintoral days!",04/17/10 07:20,ChemistRhi
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"this is so much a better improvement on the original Euphoria for men. the intense version meshes nicely with the fragrance theme and packaging of the womens.

i have a feeling that originally they wanted to go with this version but instead choose the light fresh scented original.

it is a market shame that two fragrances now exist under the same name and theme - talk about confusing the average customers. my thoughts drop the intense from the name and discontinue the original and have this replace it!",02/27/10 21:30,junior halston
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Really nice, although it seems a bit as if CK were unsatisfied with the original Euphoria. One gets the impression that the original Euphoria hasn't been ready for release back in 2006, but rather rushed out. They surely improved that with this one two years later.

Nevertheless, one definite mixture instead of two scents that are essentially the same would have been a better idea.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,like many ck fragrances it has great opening. watermelon with some spices. unfortunatly after those great opening it only becomes worse (but of course it is still good). dry down is only sweet vanilla on my skin. so it's typical evenign/winter/fall scent.,07/10/09 13:58,da_markos
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,Surprisingly good amber oriental. Starts out quite sweet but becomes drier and more interesting as it progresses. Drydown is a nice cedar/musk. Smells both sexy and cozy. Good one to try if you're looking for a soft oriental.,07/05/09 20:20,BlackAmberMoon
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I get compliments all the time when I wear this one. Euphoria Intense is unique and sweet, but still masculine. It has an impressive opening that leads to a pleasant and warm drydown. Great scent!",06/09/09 23:17,EJS
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"This opens smelling a lot like Euphoria, stronger, even better. But then on my skin it turn to this disgusting salty smell.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I was excited when i saw this. The original Euphoria was very low quality and didnot last on my dark skin. Also it was getting 'feminine scent' comments, so i stopped using it.

I thought that the intense version would last much longer, be a little manlier and would be a stronger scent with added perfume extract.

Well this turned out to be a very big disappointment for me. I found a much worse scent than the original. This is just as average quality as the original. Doesn't last, flowery feminine and synthetic.",03/15/09 15:19,crfan
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I found the notes and composition of Euphoria fantastic but the quality was extremely low and it turned out to be a huge disappointment for me. The phases of the fragrance were complete in half an hour and the rest 1 hour was all about a cloying sweet smell. After this experience i swore to wait at least 1,5 hours after testing a fragrance and before buying it :)

I wondered if the quality was better with Euphoria Intense. Again the fragrance mesmerized me the moment i smelled it on my skin but faded to a sweet-sour smell in half an hour and made me want to wash it off immediately. This time i was wise enough to wait to see how the fragrance would evolve and did not waste my money :) I really miss the old CKs.",01/07/09 14:17,acc
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I love perfumes with cedar. They remind me of ancient epic times. My husband bought it recently, and whenever he puts it on, I feel as if some hero from previous lives popped in to say hi.
I like the introduction of the fruit-like flirtation, and then the firm and not too gaudy statement it makes. Some perfumes to me seem more eloquent than others. This one doesn't use many words, but the few it does, have an exclamation mark at the end.",11/12/08 07:32,argeada
Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I'm wearing it right now, and everytime I wear it I get so many compliments.

Euphoria Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I think it is way too sweet for a mens scent, even in todays trend. First blast is so filled with sugar, with a watermelon type fruity feeling, later it tuned down to a biscuit cacophony. I was looking forward to find the oudh out from it, but the patchouli overkilled everything. Unbalanced IMHO.",11/03/08 15:48,baliquez

Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"First impression is that this is Calvin Klein's equivalent of something in the genre of Paco Rabanne One Million. It's a lighter, less sweet version.

I love a standard mainstream fragrance, but first impressions are that this doesn't do anything for me.",03/13/25 03:49,Oli G

Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"So this is not like OG Obsession for Men, Night or Dark Obsession. This is its own thing. Add a little spice to Y EDP, Dylan Blue with CK Eternity and CK One DNA hidden down under. It's a wonderful scent I truly think it's an all year scent. Clean, fresh some blue but not flat like BDC or super Ambroxan like Sauvage EDT or EDP, it's very nice!! I got a 4 oz bottle lightly used for $40 after browsing and putting in offers. For a Calvin Klein collector like myself thats a good deal because this is discontinued. OG formula Obsession for Men will always have a place special to me with the cinnamon, amber, spice, creme brulee and so much more. Dark Obsession is so alluring and unique and wonderfully chocolate/vanilla with oddly some nods to the original obsession for men. Obsession Night is alone a calm scent heavy Pear, not blue, not green, just relaxing and unique. There are 2 you love or hate, Obsession for Men, Obsession Night for Men. Dark Obsession and this Obsessed for Men are 2 that are more universally accepted as anywhere from ok to fantastic. Anyway if you like Dylan Blue, Oxford Blue by English Laundry, BDC EDT, Y EDP and small amount of Ck One and CK Eternity you will like this. Won't blow your hair back but it's very nice. Sits close to skin like a lot of CK products, spray a lot, spray your clothes. I don't agree that this is some kind of winter or fall scent or super spicy. Trust me on the comparisons. Don't pay attention to the list above.",10/25/24 15:01,ThompsonObsession23
Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"As a lifelong Obsession wearer I was surprised to discover this new scent only a few months ago. The longevity and performance of this fragrance is superb when compared to Obsession. It has a citrus and spicy opening which projects quite well. It is quite strong at opening, but it does smooth out in about 30 minutes. The musky and vanilla notes remain on my skin for about 6 to 8 hours and I could smell it on clothing about 12 hours later.",10/19/24 01:41,GeoMar12

Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"A blind buy. I'm usually not one for sweet fragrances, especially those with ambroxan. Yet when I saw this available for a good price, I thought why not? I've never met a CK scent that I absolutely hated, plus I probably needed at least one sweet scent in my arsenal (now that my Cool Water Intense is gone).

Not bad. I concur with most of the positive comments here. The vanilla never really comes through to me. It's an unusual blend of slightly candied citrus and amber, with a ghost note of fig (?). The ambroxan is noticeable and ensures this will be an occasional reach for me, never a regular one.

Beautifully minimalist bottle, with a great feel.

Recommended if you like sweet fragrances, and are not expecting for this flanker to resemble the original legend in any way whatsoever.",05/09/23 17:30,Br'eauDeCologne
Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"Certainly not bad for the price tag. It doesn’t feel as modern as it should nor is it the homage to the OG I was hoping to experience since that was such an epic release. Especially for its time.

Haven’t been able to find the intense version so can’t speak on that.

It’s a pleasant woody citrusy vibe that projects pretty well in the first hour or two then fades into something uncomplicated and nice. Just a little boring for my taste. Or maybe I was expecting to be wowed when I realized one of my favorite perfumers, Ilias Ermenidis was involved. I’ll gladly use up that 2ml and move on lol.",12/20/22 07:25,frederickf_
Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"Like my other CK fragrances it's a pleasant office-safe fragrance for day-to-day wear. It's also inexpensive so part of my daily rotation when I am WFH or in the office.

Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"Sweet, with some spice, and a distinct touch of clean/fresh. Nice and cozy in the early stages, but drydown fairly generic. I’d avoid wearing it on hot summer days.

[07/27/22 Update: This one has fallen out of favor with me. I no longer like it at all on my skin. I had to wash it off after 30 minutes last time I put it on. I don't dislike the scent itself. I just don't like it on me. I sprayed some around the room as air freshener and didn't think badly of it at all that way, so that's what this bottle will be used for from now on until used up. Or maybe I can find the right combination of fragrances to layer it with.]",05/30/22 20:43,MidwesternGothic
Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,Spicy grapefruit and ambroxan with the weird sourness I've smelled in most CK fragrances. 5/10,02/10/22 04:20,thebloff
Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"This has so many notes I normally dislike: cardamom, lavender, leather, labdanum, ambroxan, vanilla, amberwood. In normal cases, these notes would automatically cause my review to be negative.

HOWEVER, Calvin Klein Obsessed for men is one of the rarer instances that I actually kind of don't mind despite many of the notes aforementioned. It's very strong, for sure, and lasts and lasts, but there is something smooth about it that I can't afford to dislike. The blend is done satisfactorily, and the bottle is really lovely. The opening is especially remarkable, really fresh and citrusy, and when it dries down, it's less impressive but still decent.

The dry down has a clear vanilla plus ambroxan scent, but on my skin, I don't get leather that much. Maybe it works differently on others?

I don't think this has much feminine vibe at all. I wouldn't imagine this on a woman.

Update: I just had another sniff at this and I think I like this one less than before. The ambroxan is too strong for me. I've moved this fragrance to 'ok' as a result.",12/20/21 01:48,washudtoj

Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"A very pleasant, basic, formal cologne. It has a soft warm vanillic ambery base. And has a sweet slightly vibrant candy like Twizzler scent from its projection. It's weird, Obsessed smells youthful and kinda old timey at the same time. It's like if you brought a 17 year old from the 1950's to present day. Yes they're still youthful, but they feel like they have very old-school values. Obsessed is what kids today would describe as ""mid"" (average or ok) It's like the Ford Fusion of colognes. A very basic product that's going to get you from A to B, that's not going to overly impress or offend. I find myself only wanting to wear Obsessed in cordial setting like Church or Work. Where I don't want to offend, but don't want to smell bland either. It's a respectable cologne. Not a must have however, it's easily substitutable.",05/05/21 13:21,MaxIntoxication
Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"I got this fragrance for almost a year and what I can say about it is this: It's not a Sauvage clone (way far from it) although, I can get the smell of ambrox and pepper. The vibes of leather and vanilla are also prominent, but the citrusy from the opening is, somewhat, faint. What bugs me is that most people say there's a pinneapple note on it when there's none. I recommend this fragrance on a warm weather during the day or afternoons.
About longevity, this one last about 7 hours on my skin( given or taken) and the projection is no more than an arm's length.
Obsessed is a nice and plesant fragrance, easy to wear on casual dates, office or daily basis, but if comparing a Sauvage edt with this CK fragrance I'd say that Obsessed is a firecraker, but worth buying it

This one has an amazing dry down and on my skin and clothes lasts at least 6 to 8 hours strong. It’s sweet, sexy, vanilla perfect for dates, night outs and just fall and winter all around. It’s even sexy and light enough to wear in the summer nights as well. A great well blended fragrance. I haven’t purchased it yet but it’s next on my list for sure! The amber and vanilla with the fresh woody notes blend amazingly and make for a super sexy lovable scent. Definitely worth the buy.",09/20/20 12:29,Scotty123
Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"When I first tried Obsessed, I loved them fresh opening, and there was an almost creamy vibe as it dried down. I've worn it a few times but rarely gone back to it after picking up other fragrances. I recently started wearing it again, but found the fresh creamy lemon and woody smell quickly fades away and turns to a skin scent after around an hour or two for me. Can pick up the ambroxan later down the line but it barely comes off the skin at that point. It's a scent I like the smell of, but it just doesn't stick around long enough.",08/27/20 08:14,walkm1
Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein Obsessed For Men EDT opens with a moderate projection of very sweet, spices, and fruity accords. The opening is aromatic, dense, and very pleasant. The vanilla is a base note but it comes up as soon as the fragrance is sprayed creating a sweet and aromatic note; the grapefruit, lemon, and pineapple are opening aromatic citrus and fruity notes, the pineapple is more prominent than the lemon and grapefruit; the pepper and cardamom add a spicy touch, similarly, the lavender adds a soft floral touch. The leather that initially was a whiff starts developing, nothing bold, but projecting and aromatic; similarly, the cedar and labdanum join with fragrance with fresh woody and sweet, ambery accords respectively; the ambroxan also joins the blend with its ambery and powdery projecting note but not as strong as the vanilla; the cinnamon joins the vanilla with a sweet-spicy touch. The patchouli and geranium are support faint notes. The most noticeable opening to dry-down changes in this fragrance is the very fruity and citrusy opening, these notes are at the top closely followed by the spices; as the fragrance dries down, these fruity notes significantly dissipate, and in their place, the fragrance brings the sweet resinous touches of the labdanum and cinnamon, projected by the leather, vanilla, and ambroxan. Once Calvin Klein Obsessed has reached its full dry-down, it can be summarized as a very sweet, resinous, and leathery fragrance with woody, spicy, soft floral, and fruity accords. The fragrance feels casual, comforting, delectable, dense, gourmand, inviting, mature, mild, inviting, masculine, modern, leathery, resinous, rich, sweet, syrupy, warm, woody and very pleasant.

Although the bottle says ""for Men"" this is not a very macho fragrance and can be worn by ladies too!

It is a Warm,Oriental ,Woody and Spicy perfume .The opening notes are sharp Spicy and Cedar for me,it then settles to a sweeter but not overtly Vanilla and AmberI do not notice the other notes palpably.

The scent itself is perfectly lovely. I'm really glad I bought this. It's definitely very synthetic and vanilla driven, like a lighter and less scratchy Stronger With You. Sort of. Medium strength, 7-ish hours of longevity. Does what it says, more or less. Watch out, though. Can be a tiny bit sweet.",02/12/19 01:23,damienthoresson
Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"This one is very sweet on me. I know the pineapple note is rather far down in the main notes list but I get a big blast of it when I put this on and that pineapple note sticks around for a good while. That's not a bad thing at all but was surprising. On my skin this stays sweet for the whole duration (@ 6 hours) and ends up a nice vanilla. I'm aware that's probably not the results others may be getting but that's how it behaves on me. Overall I really like this one but it's possible some may think it's kinda boring. That may be so but at least it's a good smelling boring! I had trouble with Dark Obsession containing a note that went very floral on me (I don't like florals) and it made me wary of this one but Obsessed doesn't have that issue, thankfully.",12/29/18 21:37,Tigidy101

It is very unisex in my opinion, in fact I think it leans (slightly) more feminine, it's something that I'd find very appealing on a lovely lady.

Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,I basically came on here to find out if this Could Be unisex. I was on the CK website and when I read the notes cast of this fragrance I almost bought it before even looking to see if it was for women or not. I'm glad to see that a lot of people indicated that it can be worn by a woman. I'm basically writing this because I'm also constantly on the search for something that smells like original vintage women's eternity. That was my favorite perfume in high school in the late 80s. I haven't worn that in many many years and recently purchased a new bottle of it and I was shocked at what I received. I thought that it was a fake. It resembles what it used to smell like but it's not the heavy hitter that it once was. I miss that strong beautiful opening and the green notes in eternity. Where in the world did all the green notes go? That's what made the perfume Beautiful. Anyway I know this is not a review about eternity but this seems like the group that might have a clue about this. I don't know how to describe precisely what I'm talking about. In fact just understanding that it's the green note in eternity that I'm missing is brogress for me. Oh and I also saw that they are selling something called eternity intense. I'm about to look that up to see if it is something better than the fake eternity that they're selling now,06/30/18 19:46,waskotransportation

Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"Dont listen to GRAF this smells absolutely nothing like sauvage, sauvage is utter crap and massively overrated. Wish everyone would stop comparing everything to it, the only fragrance that smells similar to sauvage is Prada carbon and that's just the opening. People really need to stop pretending like they know their stuff and actually get a clue. Like CB23 says it's completely misleading and idiotic.

On the other hand this is a very nice fragrance, refreshing and unique but like all CK frags quality is questionable.",05/19/18 04:29,biff2
Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"Very pleasant warm spicy scent with some freshness from the  dominant  ambroxan. It feals like a cousin of the mighty Dior Sauvage. It could be a flanker of it.

Dominant notes are ambroxan, mild vanilla, pepper, citruses (mainly grageftuit), smooth & mild cardamom, lavender.

Performance is very good for a CK scent. Moderate sillage/projection and moderate to long lasting longevity (somewhere between 5,5-6,5 hours). Very good versatility, a mass appealling spring/fall daytime fragrance. If you feel that Dior Sauvage is too much or harsh for you, this is an alternative. Well done CK.",05/15/18 08:12,GRAF

Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein obsessed takes the same route as Montblanc legend night. Sweet and vanilliac with a citrus spine. In this case, the citrus coming from pineapple - which makes a really interesting mixture. With a close sniff, it gives it a pungent twist - which I think is good! Overall I would consider this to be 70% similar to legend night - and I would say they are both on the same level in terms of overall smell. I’m surprised this one gets so much dislike - but hey, more of me wearing it and less of you! I’m very pleased with this scent - and I can see this one being grabbed often for all occasions.

Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"Amazing soapy opening that mixes well with some sweetness, cardamom, and the leather. It has an effervescent feel too it, it smells very fresh and sweet.

Then after about 30 minutes it dries down to what I consider a ""date"" style scent. It's a smooth, sweet, warm, resinous, vanilla, scent that lasts for ages. In this stage it is sort of like Eros with that fresh, woody, vanilla thing going on. It smells very much in line with that trendy modern sweetness.

I am fairly averse to ambroxan, but this one comes off more like a classic amber unisex soapiness and fades to the background of the fragrance within an hour, but lasting as this subtle base note until the next day. It's nothing like the god awful ambroxan found in Dior Sauvage or the Prada Luna Rossa line, both of which make me nauseous.

There are some drawbacks to this one for me, I am not a fan of the patchouli that comes in the dry down, it's very strong. And it's a tad bit generic/boring.",02/13/18 21:42,rushrocker
Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"Right off the top, Obsessed hits me with that trademark CK freshness - citrus pop infused with a tastefully light lavender touch, rounded out with a subtle spicy edge. Fantastic to my nose, being one who enjoys both fresh and spicy scents.

After a good 15-20 minutes of that delightful opening, I definitely start to get the comparisons to Jazz Club - rich, natural leather with a rounded ISO-e (cedar) edge, sweetened ever so lightly by (I guess) geranium and pineapple. I do not pick up the sweet notes individually, but more as a collective, there to keep Obsessed from getting too dry.

As the hours loom, the heavy hitters emerge, but not in a way that you'd expect given the stated notes. What I get is a lot of rich, creamy vanilla with ambroxan and patchouli playing so far back that you might not even notice they're there, except for the occasional tell-tale wisp. Smoothness and taste in a modest but persistent scent bubble. Just the way I like it.

Overall I get liberal sillage for the first few minutes only, followed by what I'd consider to be arm's length for maybe 2-3 hours, drawing back to about 12"" after that. Total duration is longer than I initially expected, no less than 5-6 hours with only a moderate application (3-4 sprays total, neck and wrists). It's a bit on the sweeter side, but in a way that to me reeks of confidence and class. Wife loves it too.

EDIT: Over time, this has come to strike me as imbalanced and really cheap smelling -- cloyingly sweet and just a mess. It's one of those rare beasts that starts out great but wears out its welcome. Can't stand it now.",01/23/18 09:52,OntheMark
Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"There is an undeniable ""Calvin Klein DNA."" From the original Obsession through Eternity to Contradiction, from CK One Shock to CK Be, Calvin Klein fragrances can usually be counted on to include a core of lavender, amber, bergamot (or some other citrus), and (usually) cedar.

This Obsessed release contains the lavender, amber, cedar, and citrus notes which mark it as very Calvin Klein.

It opens with a very bright citrus sweetness (heightened by pineapple, but sharpened by pepper) that lasts for a very long time. After a half hour or so, some floral shades start to appear, still topped off with the lemon and grapefruit notes.

As the final dry down approaches, the cardamom and lavender (grounded by a soft vanilla base) rise to the top and begin to stand out as compliments to the cedar and citrus, and the bouquet becomes extremely reminiscent of YSL's La Nuit de l'Homme (which also prominently features cardamom and lavender). I was rather taken aback by this similarity, and found it very pleasing.

There is very little connection between this fragrance and the original Obsession (or its flankers), but there doesn't need to be. This juice stands up all on its own.

The projection and longevity are both above average (I'm still catching fairly strong whiffs nearly 8 hours later), and this is a welcome change from recent Calvin Klein releases.

Thumbs up to this one. I'll be using it regularly during the warmer months.",01/12/18 21:52,ReturnToScenter
Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"I like this less than the women's version... but that isn't to say I dislike it. It's nothing groundbreaking but there's something chilly about it, sort of like a spiced sorbet? It's a little sweet, very spicy and the vanilla just makes it quite creamy.

Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"First, let me say that as a female, I’ve always been drawn to “male” fragrances with sweeter bases. They work nicely with my body chemistry, while “female” sweet fragrances usually turn intolerably, cloyingly sweet. I’ve been on the hunt for a gourmand men’s cologne for a long time, but unfortunately, this one isn’t going to work out for me.

The top phase was sweet vanilla, citrus, and leather. One of my first thoughts was “My goodness! This is so well-blended!” Then, the pepper came through and added a lot of personality to the vanilla note. This part of the wear reminded me of a spicier Dr. Pepper … really interesting! Unfortunately, I caught a few whiffs of what smelled like stale, citrusy orris, which was very off-putting. Most of the wear for this fragrance is heavy, masculine spice with an undercurrent of sharp, powdery vanilla. I get the slightest touch of ambroxan, but I can’t smell the cedar note at all. I also can’t pick up on the cardamom, but I suspect it’s just blended in with the pepper.

Good longevity and sillage; what you would expect from a traditional men’s cologne.

Unfortunately, this fragrance became too robust for me after about 2-3 hours of wear; too strong, too powdery, too sharp. It’s just too potent for me to feel comfortable wearing on a day-to-day basis. This is definitely unisex, though, and I know there are plenty of women that would love this fragrance.",10/04/17 12:31,supergirl9412

This is a classic feel-good, sweet and sensual fragrance - no challenging notes or awkward layering here. It's like a less powerful course of Ultra Male by JPG.

Obsessed is sweet, ultra sweet, super sweet fragrance with that bubble gum super fruity sirupy and a bit spicy dry down that is typical for Ultra Male. I got some iris in Obsessed that makes it closer to Zara Gourmand Leather.

That a good news for those who complain Ultra Male is discontinued or out of sale somewhere. Obsessed will be a right replacement. Like it.

Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"Everyone is so quick to slag off Abroxan but I think it's a very interesting base and can be put to great use in these modern scents.
After wearing it became apparent this is fragrance of three distinct phases.
Obsessed is a strange one really because it opens very nicely with much of the Calvin Klein freshness and the intriguing charm of things like Crave or CK2. Unfamiliar, fresh spicy notes of kumquat or starfish or some crap like that but never the less very nice. Then it becomes abundantly clear that it might just be one of these confused, messy generic fragrances, a dud of little significance and quickly dismissed like many others and I don't think this is entirely down to the ambroxan. Anyway....Thankfully and quite inexplicably that subsides and Obsessed has a 'third act' so to speak which adds another twist to the tale, in the form of a creamy vanilla type warmth and maybe just maybe... the Labdanum listed in the notes? If you read my reviews you might know that I'm huge fan of that resin and although I can't place it in here as such, the base does have a nice cosy drydown so I'm not dismissing the possibility. Now normally the fresh, unusual, hard to place, top notes, coupled with a crowd pleasing generic heart and a warm (or 'sensual' as they will market it as) vanilla/synth amber drydown sounds like my idea of a horrible frgrance trying to be all things to all people and doing none of them right.
However, I quite like Obsessed. I kinda wish CK had the bravery to make a pungent, masculine call back to the original Obsession, now that would've peaked my interest.
I'll have to wear this again but the opening was very pleasant, I have no issue with abroxan and the boring aspects weren't too boring and the creamy drydown is nice....so it's a like from me.",08/07/17 08:04,Houdini4

Obsessed for Men Calvin Klein,"I begin with a disclaimer. I did NOT want to like this men's cologne, Obsessed. To my way of thinking, the last decent thing CK offered was ""Truth,"" in 2002, and even it has fallen by the wayside. So, with a mind full of jaded skepticism, I went into Belk and sprayed it on. Wow! I was intrigued. Went to look at the notes; I was impressed. Waited for the scent to settle in; I was excited. It's UNlike ANYthing out there right now, and in a good way! It smells as transparent as it looks (which is clean and simple), but the transparency is, you ""get"" the notes. Blast of citrus, then woods, then a solid base of ambrox, patchouli, and an amazingly male scent friendly vanilla note. One of the cleanest frags I've sprayed in awhile. Definitely worth having in your rotation; plus the price is reasonable. Oh yes, there WILL be ""haters"" out there (some folks hate for the sheer joy of hating); but if you give it a fair hearing (smelling), you will want it, for sure.

It is indeed watermelon and clean linen sheets. Throw in a slightly weak pear note and you've got this scent. The watermelon is somewhat weak as well but still noticeable. It's not bad at all and a perfectly good summer selection. Not unique and Calvin Klein has even released similar fragrances to this one in different years. It doesn't project very well and I'd say it lasts 3-4 hours so only so so longetivity. This is starting to sound negative but it's a good summer scent overall...at it's price point!

Eternity for Men Summer 2014 Calvin Klein,"First, the bottle looks darker ""in person,"" and it has a rainbow effect as well, sort of like horizontal stripes every other inch or so (thus the picture may be for a different flanker). Anyway, there is a rather standard woody amber base, but it seems a bit less generic, perhaps because some sandalwood aroma chemicals were added. It's a little fruity, a little herbal, and with a touch of spice. The musk is mild, and it doesn't come across as especially ""synthetic,"" though the depth and note separation is as your would expect (clearly not ""niche quality""). It's not especially strong but it's certainly ""nice,"" and I guess many would call it excellent as a casual or gym scent. I'm on the fence about keeping this one, because I have the more interesting Cactus Shot by Everlast, and I don't wear these kinds of scents often.

UPDATE: The aroma chemicals finally got to me with this one, so I returned it.

I say if you have $20-25 to spare and are somewhat of a collector as I am then snag a bottle. Else you can stick with any other light/summer scent that fills that place in your lineup.

Given the scent and price point, no complaints here.
Good casual scent for school, gym, out of the shower, errands, even office. I sometimes wear it to bed because it simply smells light, refreshing, and soothing. You could douse yourself in it and still not overwhelm a room, so that's a plus since I'm a bit heavy-handed. :-P",04/20/15 20:11,huberrobert
Eternity for Men Summer 2014 Calvin Klein,"It's a nice, clean generic fragrance that kind of brings back simplicity in the many complex fragrances currently in the market.

Eternity for Men Summer 2014 Calvin Klein,"By reading some negative reviews about this perfume on the internet, I thought it was a bad idea to buy this pefume. But I really wanted a cologne for summer. So I decided to try it on my skin when I went to the store. And I have to admit that, although not a powerful fragrance, is very good, pefect for hot days. It is soft, nice, cool. I really like it. Regarding longevity, it's good for a summer cologne, I could feel the smell present 5-6 hours on my skin.",06/27/14 11:35,johan00418
Eternity for Men Summer 2014 Calvin Klein,"Smells great for like two seconds. I sprayed 2 to the neck, 3 chest, and 2 to outer wrist.....after an hour very faint... very poor longevity and projection.

I do love the all 3 phases of this juice.",05/22/14 00:31,xraytekca
Eternity for Men Summer 2014 Calvin Klein,Great fragrance I bought the 2013 version for a discounted price wish I would've waited cause I like this one a little better the watermelon and apricot kind of give it a bubble gum type of smell but it is extra fresh and so clean its a nice scent to add to your summer fragrance lineup its affordable too,05/08/14 11:00,dmirror

This one gets compliments from the first spray. I work in a Department Store and am constantly in the Fragrance department sniffing around. I smelled them both before we got the sale bottles from the Vendor. This one is great, lives up to the Eternity name and will definitely get you noticed in a sexy subtle summer night way.

The success of this creation by Alberto Morillas had such a huge impact on the global market that, within a few years, people started to consider it generic. The first reason was that almost everyone had been using it since the mid-90s, and the second was the large number of imitations that appeared.

CK One Calvin Klein,"Unique smell, a lot of notes, but it is actually very simple. I dont feel this on others ever, so I wouldnt worry of its popularity. As a female would like this smell on a man equally, very fresh, woody but fresh out of the shower smell
Easy and light, after all it is a toilette, so keep that in mind. Although it will list moderately it will only be intimately felt (and that is if you have the type of skin that retains smell well)
Youthful but its suitable for all generations
If you wish for a light energetic dash of smell, especially during spring, this is a solid choice",11/06/25 10:38,dunjamaksimovic

Peppery, green, citrus top that almost makes you feel like you've layered 4711 on a modern, woody unisex.
The only pineapple fragrance I can wear. I have to be super hot and sweaty to even detect it slightly.
The florals are nice and toothy, all complimenting the semi-astringent earthiness of the rose, while carrying the freshness of that laundry musk.
The green tea and synthetic oak moss really help keep the cedar and sandalwood from smelling like a typical off-brand unisex.",10/22/25 06:30,Eau_de_Forklift

I keep a bottle on my desk and apply it liberally four or five times a day and before I go to bed. It just doesn't last longer than a couple of hours. I get a vibe from it similar to Tabac.

CK One Calvin Klein,"This was the first fragrance I smelled on someone and had to get for myself. It’s still my everyday scent and I love how it’s so clean and fresh but the citrus is still prominent enough to cut through the white floral and musky notes and remain refreshing. It’s an intimate scent, where the only people who really smell it are my friends and family when we hug or sit close to each other, but in that way it’s subconsciously become mine and I smell like that to them, which I don’t mind at all. It just works well on my skin.
Only issue is that the scent barely lasts past 3-4h, maybe not even 2 hours in hot subtropical summer. It smells too good not to use though - maybe will opt for a different version next time",09/16/25 21:30,zozobozo
CK One Calvin Klein,"i love this except for a note that is overwhelmingly harsh throughout the 2-5 minute mark after spraying. lovely citrus scent before that yuck note, and an addictive fresh, musky jasmine afterwards. ive also had a poor sense of smell since covid",09/16/25 07:02,maambalam
CK One Calvin Klein,"Very clean and bright. As cliche as it is to call a fragrance ‘clean’, it is true in this case. You can feel the genderless desire from the 90s. When sex sold in every underwear, denim, and t shirt campaign. Loves it",09/15/25 16:00,truestar001
CK One Calvin Klein,"I've just gifted a new bottle (dated 2025) and to my surprise, it's pretty much the same as the 2 old bottles I have in my collection (1 bought 15 years ago & 1 vintage with the old logo). Maybe the opening on the new one is a bit less sharp and the base on the new one is just a little thinner, but it pretty much gives out very similar wearing experience. Longevity & sillage are both pretty good.

This one is not ruined by reformulation at all, it's pretty much the same scent as it used to be.",09/11/25 04:35,jasonx
CK One Calvin Klein,"Classic unisex fragrance. Clean, fresh, citrusy, and a touch peppery; perfect for summer! I’ve just finished a 5 year-old 200ml bottle, and I’ve noticed that as it’s aged, the projection has diminished slightly, but it still lasts a long time. I love layering it over Soap & Glory Butter Yourself body lotion, which seems to make it project further and always earns me compliments. This is my go-to fragrance for holidays. I usually only bring this bottle, as it’s versatile enough for both day and night. A great, reliable everyday scent, even if it doesn’t particularly stand out.

CK One Calvin Klein,"Easy signature scent.
Not outdated- neither old smelling.

This is one of the best fragrance DNAs 🧬 to grace us!
It is legitimately the template and inspiration for so many popular frgrances-- Azzaro Chrome, Creed Silver Mountain Water, Xerjoff Mefiesto, etc.

This is one of the best smells. Performance being it's kryptonite. But for 30$ for a 100ml, spray away and reapply.

Citric, watery, juicy, powdery rose 🌹

It really is a beautiful scent.

Hall of Fame, legendary, timeless scent.

Edit: I think the biggest mistake I made when starting my fragrance journey, is assuming that cheap meant not good. Some of my favorite fragrances are the classic cheapies from the 90s and early 2000s. If I could start over, I would fill my collection with these fantastic and classic cheapies that still smell good today.

One of those classic cheapies being Ck One. It is just a lovely, happy, feel good vibrant citric-floral-rose-tea scent. I always feel good wearing this

I don't think expensive designers, that dominate the modern perfume industry hold a candle to classics such as ck one.",09/07/25 18:56,Muskyflower

Its got that 90s hairspray thing going on and I absolutely love it!! It's fresh, clean, 100% unisex, attractive, simple, but really hits the spot when you just want something cool and crisp on those hot summer nights.

CK One Calvin Klein,"Nose Note #642

I don't have much to add. But I'll say, it's nothing like Silver Mountain Water or Acqua di Gio. It's something similar to Agua de Loewe - all else I haven't tried yet.
It's a green citrus scent. There are many notes listed, but it doesn't feel complex. It's not sophisticated. It feels clean, a little bit soapy. I've tried it in a store, now I've bought a decant and I have to say it's very difficult to remember the scent for me.
To nice, it's pleasant and easy, and it's very unisex. The worst thing about it is performance. You spray it and practically a few minutes after it's a skin scent. It's like an aftershave cologne.
If you are looking for something very quiet and perfectly inoffensive - that's a good one.

CK One Calvin Klein,"I had inherited by dad's bottle from the 90's in high school and re-bought a vintage bottle to revisit it. Off the bat, it smelled really cheap, almost like a sunscreen or a boy's shower gel. After spraying and sitting for a day, it really showed its true colors- warm, soapy, spa-like. It's definitely green, but not in a room-spray way. It's wonderfully subtle, and a fragrance I'm excited to smell on myself during the day rather than for others to notice when I enter the room. It seems like it was made to be personal- hence, not much projection. I really see this working well right out of the shower, letting that freshness radiate through the day. The citrus initially is a bit sharp in an almost cleaning fluid way, but the longer it's on you the more it softens to a refreshing soap. Didn't get any scent memory from using it in high school, so maybe the formula gradually changes after opening?",08/27/25 08:52,mance

The performance however is where its lacking, ALOT. With 5 sprays there is decent projection for arond 6-7 minutes, then it just turns into a skin scent, not a scent for people who want to be noticed or for people who just generally want to smell good for other people, because they wont notice the scent, great scent for someone who wants to overpay for an ok-ish fragrance with no projection and lasting....

CK One by Calvin Klein is a timeless classic, and the one that started it all for me. It’s more than just a fragrance; it’s a time capsule. One spray and I’m instantly transported back to high school: late nights watching infomercials for Pure Moods (the CD set not sold in stores), early mornings, and Nas’ “It Was Written” playing in the background as the soundtrack to my life.

This was the scent that defined my high school years, and it’s hands-down the reason I fell in love with fragrances in the first place. While others were into Polo Blue, Clinique Happy, or Hugo Boss, I was all in on CK One and Cool Water.

For years, CK One was my daily signature. Clean, citrusy, and effortlessly cool. It struck the perfect balance between fresh and noticeable, just a solid fragrance that always delivered. Even now, in 2025, it still holds up as a gold standard for everyday wear. I’ve owned more bottles of CK One than I can remember, and I always have a bottle on hand, including right now, in 2025.

Wearing it today floods me with memories and reminds me why I started this fragrance journey. CK One isn’t just a scent, it’s my foundation. A classic. And for me, it will always be the one that started it all.",08/05/25 20:37,Illusent

CK One Calvin Klein,"This one opens straight-up window cleaner, then settles into a soft, soapy, white floral citrus scent. Light, breezy, clean. Fresh laundry with a floral twist.

I assumed this would be a simple citrus-forward scent. But once I sprayed it on skin, I was surprised at how floral it got. Soft floral jasmine, and a soapy lily of the valley note. I've learned my skin chemistry really pulls florals forward, even in fragrances that aren’t marketed that way. (Same thing happens with Club de Nuit Intense Man and Acqua di Parma Colonia Essenza. On paper, citrus bombs. On me? Floral central.)

It’s nice. Gives white shirt on a spring day. Clean, safe, inoffensive. It doesn’t project much, so it’s a solid choice for overspraying without offending noses. But personally? I could live without it. It smells good, sure. But doesn’t wow me or feel essential in any way.",07/20/25 18:27,averycj

CK One Calvin Klein,"It's the first time using this eau de toilette. I bought it because I needed a fresh scent to use during the summer, that would feel okay to spray on my skin all day long, and I'm very glad I did. After reading reviews, I don't get the hate. It feels like a flagship, timeless fragance, and the fact it was never discontinued speaks volumes about how popular and well-rounded it is from a perfumery perspective. The sillage is correct. You can take this one to the office and public transport. It won't bother anyone with a strong scent, but it will sit nicely on you making you feel fresh and clean. It reminds me a bit of shower gel, which only adds to the freshness and cleanliness of the scent. To me, it's sharp, and citrusy, with some soft florals. It's perfect for summertime and the heat. As for longevity, it depends on everyone's skin, but it lasts over 6 hours on me. I applied it before bed and woke up this morning and I could definitely smell it yet. This one might easily become one of my signature scents for the summer",07/06/25 05:13,Becca_AC
CK One Calvin Klein,"Classic 90s, which is alluring to some and off-putting to others. As someone born in 1990, this is nostalgic to me in the best way. AND, as others have said, this is the original unisex scent. As a non-binary person, it is a staple for me.",07/04/25 12:36,brumfieldsd

I remember when it came out, and every couple had a bottle so they could both wear it because it is genderless. It was everywhere! Such a happy scent, and now there are a million zillion versions. A big bottle is still available inexpensively so I can spray it on everything, though the new formulations have no lasting power. Zesty yet calming fresh citrus musk, and once again, I see it was the nose of the master, Morillas. I find CK All very similar and would like to smell them side by side.",06/26/25 03:32,greenbluegray

CK One Calvin Klein,"Lemony green opening with bergamot, orange and the suggestion of pineapple. The middle is a bit more flowery but still herbaceous and fresh/citrusy. As it continues, it does lean more feminine than at the outset, but then bounces back to masculine/unisex. It remains fresh and green but becomes more musky, woody, mossy and and bit ambery in the drydown.

Probably best for spring/summer daytime, although I used to wear it at night to parties and enjoyed it anyway :) I still really like it - it smells clean, bright, and zesty, in the best way!",06/04/25 00:16,Amber Spice

The scent is engraved in my memory after all these years, it's full of nostalgia for me. This smell is very spicy citrus, green tea, aquatic, and floral to me, with a bit of powder in the dry down. Personally, it smells of romance before the internet lol. I recently purchased a bottle it was so cheap about $30 at Ross, I am glad I did. Honestly I'm really enjoying wearing this. It's a very unisex fragrance, if you're into y2k aesthetic, maybe give this a try!",05/27/25 19:33,JardindeRosas

CK One Calvin Klein,"A citrusy, light, carefree, and warm composition bathed in the sun of a summer day. Smooth, with citrus notes that are fresh yet gentle. The whole fragrance is meant to evoke pure youthful joy. It requires reapplication, with moderate longevity and sillage.",05/26/25 06:36,Marta_Regina
CK One Calvin Klein,"I feel like CK One gets soo much unnecessary hate.
This is a very fresh perfume, mixing citruses and aquatic notes. It has good longevity as it lasts around 6 hours on my skin, although I feel it does not have much projection. Still, whenever I wear it I feel clean and fresh all day long.
This was a staple for me a year ago to the point where I wore it almost religiously. Back then I felt like the woody and green notes were so prominent, I did not feel like I smelled ""manly"" but I did not feel it smelled too ""feminine"" on me, but I loved it as I felt fresh and clean. I stopped using it after I finished a bottle and moved on to Tommy Girl.
I decided to revisit it after a year- I grabbed my mom's bottle and sprayed myself. Now CK One smells super floral and fresh on me, more ""feminine"" leaning than before.
I do not know if this is just a change in my skin's pH, influenced by the current weather, me becoming a bit ""nose blind"" to certain notes after using it for so long, or if the formula changed. And honestly? I don't really care. I loved how it smelled back then and I love how it smells now.

Ignore those comments saying this is ""tiring"" as everyone and their mothers used it. Who cares? If you want a fresh, clean, classic perfume, this is almost 100% a safe blind buy. I have never heard anyone in real life complaining about smelling it too often, about it being overdone, cloying, too ""90s"" or ""highschool reminiscent"". Enjoy this perfume for what it is and what it smells like to you.

Will always love this one as it was my first fresh perfume. Specially because my dad picked it up for me. Absolutely GOATed fragrance- just classical.",05/25/25 11:09,ponfarronline

From afar it smells clean - like fresh out of the shower using a citrus shampoo and kind of like the lifeguard you had a crush on. Up close it's charming - in a 2000's Hollister employee type of way. A light innocent fragrance, perfect for an everyday summer smell, nostalgic but youthful. I'd wear this in settings like the gym, beach, road trips, school and spraying on my hoodies for my girlfriend to steal.

Not a unique smell but something basic to reach out for when you don't want to walk out wearing nothing and I'd argue a great work scent. Just be careful you won't remind people of the questionable men they hooked up with back in the 90's.",05/24/25 10:34,Sugarsnorter

CK One Calvin Klein,"Citrus, green, some floral notes, and a bit of musk. Has a shower gel vibe to it. It kind of smells like one of the hair products I would use when I was a teen. Pretty unisex but leans slightly masculine for me.

It just smells clean. And since it's cheap its a very good dumb reach scent.
Too bad it doesn't perform all that good on me. Projects modernly for a couple hours then becomes a skin scent for a while.

CK One Calvin Klein,"I feel like if ı have smelt this fragrance back in the 90s, I would have liked it much more. And I can see why this was very succesful and beloved by many back in the days, it is just outdated nowadays for sure. The opening is actually a very fresh, green, citrusy and slightly tropical smell, which is the highlight of the fragrance. As it dries down, I get a sweaty musky scent with cat piss nuances.

Lately I've been sampling it for the sake of nostalgia and found it to be so pleasing that I finally bought a bottle. Going solely by memory I feel like whatever note I originally found strange is no longer present. It's also possible my very limited experience with fragrance during that time of my life made me unsure of CK one. Today I smell it and I feel it's truly a nice, everyday, casual, summer scent.

CK One Calvin Klein,"A Tragic Tale of Citrus, Identity, and a Love That Couldn’t Last

Ah, Calvin Klein CK One — This is the OG unisex fragrance, created in a time when people thought sharing a cologne was a cute relationship milestone, right after making a mixtape and slightly before getting matching denim jackets.

Spraying CK One is like stepping into a citrus cloud that's been filtered through a Gap commercial from 1994. It opens enthusiastic citrus “HELLO I’M AWAKE,” followed by some floral notes that whisper, “But I’m also emotionally available.”

The dry down? A soft, warm, just-a-hint-of-musk and spice, skin scent that clings like a hug from someone who says things like “Let’s just vibe.” It’s the fragrance equivalent of drinking sparkling water in a linen shirt while sitting on a windowsill, contemplating your next spontaneous road trip to nowhere.

Lasting power? Let’s just say CK One likes to Irish goodbye your skin after about 3–4 hours. But hey, it’s not ghosting — it’s mysterious.

Final thoughts: If you want to smell like a fresh breeze flirting with a spicy citrus tree, CK One is your jam. Just be prepared for at least one person to say, “Oh my god, I used to wear that in high school!”

THE BREAKDOWN

Longevity: 4–6 hours — like your last situationship: light, fresh, and gone before dinner
Projection: Moderate — people will notice… if they’re close enough to borrow your hoodie
Smells like: A citrusy blast of 90s nostalgia, clean laundry, and unbothered confidence
Best for: Literally anyone — your girlfriend, your roommate, your mom... yourself.
Rating: 7/10 — iconic, but not gonna pay your bills
Vibe: Genderless angel sipping lemon water while ignoring drama",04/21/25 06:41,Poor Dear Richard

CK One Calvin Klein,"I felt compelled to leave another review, since the fragrance is working perfectly with my mood and today's bright, sunny day with beautiful flowers blooming at 13'C. This is a masterpiece indeed. There's no other way to describe it. There is a good reason why modern releases from niche houses get inspiration from such masterpieces from the old days, because they know these are great scents. If you've been looking down on it because of its low price and the label or your association with your youth, you need to get rid of your judgments. This scent reminded me how good of a fragrance house Calvin Klein was and still is... I am going to get a few other bottles from this house.

And this is a unisex fragrance. Both men and women would enjoy this scent... Thank you Calvin Klein.",04/14/25 21:40,Perfumeissex

As it develops I'm getting some spicier and woody notes. It smells like Johnson's baby shampoo. Over all I am happy to have a 15 ml of this for Spring, we'll see if I want to keep to keep it around long term.

It’s primarily made up of green notes and refreshing lemon, but also jasmine and gently woody undertones. Marketed as unisex, I wore it a bit in the past, but I found it leaned more toward the masculine side, so I gave it to my boyfriend.

CK One Calvin Klein,"Nothing screams 90s to me like this one. It was the beginning of the supermodels, Levis 501 jeans and that time everyone smelled like ck-one. It was the first unisex fragrance we used back then, it had such a moment, and had a massive cultural impact. This was used both by men and women-not shocking now, but unheard of at the time.
I know based on todays options this is no longer very impressive but in my mind this changed how we approached fragrance, it encapsulated a cultural moment. It is a fresh, fun, and light smell, but also a synthetic mess. But still, will always have a special place in my heart.",03/28/25 02:24,Rachelita
CK One Calvin Klein,This fragrance is definitely not as complicated as it looks on the notes. Like all of the comments below me said if u r going to be outside for more than 2hours this is definitely not worth even spraying.

Don't bother looking at that crazy scent profile this smells like lemon and some wood with a huge alcohol smell in the background , very manly and old smelling , if it had a better longevity it would've cost 10x because its genuinely so nice and comforting .

CK One Calvin Klein,"Something about this spring made me curious about the 90's flowery scents. Something smelling like light clean bouquets, with a twist that i mostly can't find in current designer perfumes. While i remembered the name of this perfume, the last time i smelled it was as a teenager ten years ago.

It was about the time to try this well-known thing. And it was exactly what i was looking for. Very lightly floral but complex smell, a little soapy and powdery in a way that makes you feel freshly bathed. In the base i smell a hint of oak moss, sandalwood and green tea. Sits beautifully on the skin and people around me found it pleasant too. Clean, office-friendly scent.",03/20/25 15:41,zuzana_na
CK One Calvin Klein,"Now I understand the work that goes into fragrances and I try not to crap on them because for every group that doesn't like it , there's a ton of other people that find it very good.
For Me: I went out and smelled this at Macy's when it came out. To my nose it smells feminine. Not overtly feminine, but this isn't unisex.

If you look at the heart notes described above it's plain as day that they're in there..... a lot of Florals. A thumbs down for me.
In fact if I'm correct this fragrance started the whole unisex vibe. And it was a very very slowwwwww start back then. Today you have unisex fragrances that are neutral, which I am definitely cool with.

CK One Calvin Klein,"To all the haters, get over yourselves. There are many better fragrances (although personally I like this one - think of it as spring/summer cologne-style) but very few ever become as iconic. This fragrance was groundbreaking and has cemented it's place as a hall of fame. Consider how many fashion or fragrance icons you can own and wear daily having such an accessible price.
How or why iconic? Consider that his was the first fragrance properly marketed as unisex; in fact it's aim was to be a fragrance for all. Quite a mission brief but it is pulled off with simple apolomb. Consider the then revolutionary, almost brutalist, industrial packaging with the opaque glass and metal, with its simple logo stamped on. It was born in the 90s an era where gender started to free itself from the traditional lines. Men became Metrosexual, Kate Moss became the ultimate supermodel, grunge and counter culture became popular. CK one cut across all these lines and boundaries, and let me remind you how hard it is to accomplish such feats.

I think it comes quite close, though to my nose ck one is way more pleasant smelling. Has a green-citrusy opening and maybe after 1 hour goes closer to the skin but sometimes still smelling it around me. Fresh, herbal, soapy in dry down. People say this is not long lasting. Of course it gets weaker after a while but I was wearing it yesterday again and it lasted easy 7 hours plus. Close to the skin, not projecting too much but still there. I like it for what it is and as casual wear at home or to the gym. Solid 7.5/10. (I'm male if that matters)",03/09/25 19:08,Homak1

CK One Calvin Klein,"Very light, fresh and inoffensive scent. This was my Mom’s signature scent back in the day and it just reminds me of her, so that is my main reason for liking it.

CK One Calvin Klein,"Signature scent of poor financial decisions and phoniness. This is a scent that I cannot separate the fragrance from the people who I always encountered wearing it. From high school to when I was a bartender, I knew immediately the type of person to expect when a scent wall of CK One entered the scene and slapped everyone in the nose on its way past. I wish I didn’t have such biased associations with it because its description sounds lovely.",02/28/25 13:49,JimmyDandy
CK One Calvin Klein,"My dad used to wear this back in early to mid 2000s. I remember seeing the glass bottle on the shelf and wanting to touch it because it looked so sophisticated! Citrusy scent hiding the slightly powdery surprise that resembles a pristine white sheets. Very clean, very sharp. I can imagine it as both a casual and a professional scent as it’s not offensive or polarizing. Maybe not for colder days as it can get off-putting. Not for me (as much as I am still drawn by the cool bottle at the store!!) because I prefer sweeter, more exotic scents that my dad doesn’t really approve of, but if you want to smell like crispy cool with some garnish of cold sliced lemons, I can assure you this is the way to go!",02/26/25 19:30,RagequittingNetflix

CK One Calvin Klein,"My mom's signature scent throughout my teenage years. I recently bought her a full size bottle for her birthday. She only had a mini in her bathroom and hadn't worn it in years. She was thrilled and immediately doused herself in it. Her smile was beaming. She was in the recovery center at the hospital at the time and had made quick friends with two other ladies there. She showed it to one and she asked her kids to get her a bottle for her next birthday. It smells like a well rounded approachable person. I may need to buy a bottle for myself, so I can bring my mom to work. She's a freaking cool lady.",02/19/25 12:22,SaulGoo
CK One Calvin Klein,"Back to this scent after a break. A while back I collected a 200ml bottle for £27 ($34), but at this moment, can be acquired for £23.76 (bargain price) via Amazon Subscribe & Save. Like I thought back then, and many years before when I first got it, the hate for this fragrance is completely unwarranted. I've seen comments ranging from 'it's disgusting' to foul to garbage, etc.

I honestly think those who make those comments need to have nasal surgery because their ability to smell is not in working normal order. Seriously...

This neither smells disgusting nor the best fragrance ever. What it does smell like is a fresh inoffensive great summer fragrance. If you are heading out somewhere and want to smell good or just freshen up without caring to spend £255 for Louis Vuitton's Imagination or Pacific Chill and still achieve the same results, you can't go wrong with this.

I like other fragrances more than this one (most of them are considerably more expensive than CK One), but I still really enjoy this and like it significantly more than some other more costly ones, too, and can appreciate the perfumery at a great price.",02/19/25 03:32,rebeccathomas911
CK One Calvin Klein,"i love when I smell this on my man. It’s fresh, aromatic, and soapy.

CK One Calvin Klein,"A monument to my youth. This will forever evoke visions of dodgy Caesar haircuts, plain white tees, buxom blondes and malnourished models. A sentimental favorite that I will always keep around and a scent that continues to remain relevant despite the tides of trends and time. You can still spray this on and feel like a sexy boy. And not in any way, however, like a boy toy.",02/14/25 11:38,SchmealMaynley
CK One Calvin Klein,7/10. I always doubt the notes on this site cause no way in god damn hell does this cologne have all those notes. This is a soapy powdery fresh slightly spicy smell but overall pretty generic bro. Honestly almost smells like a lotion or suncreen lol. Like it's pretty good but cmon bruh y'all be making shit up.,02/10/25 21:53,FiveFootBeast
CK One Calvin Klein,"CK One is a perfect, sweet, refreshing blend.
Sugary rose is prominent, but the lemon citrus note keeps the sweet, powdery, floral elements from becoming too much like candy. Deep, herbal tea bass notes keep this from being too flat. It is a little soapy and fresh, but still feels modern and not overly nostalgic. Both masculine and feminine in equal measure, which is quite an accomplishment.
This is not a powerhouse in terms of projection and endurance, but I find it stronger than others seem to. I also would have no problem carrying a small, decanted spray bottle of this around with me in the summer to reapply every now and then.",02/06/25 10:10,A_K_E

It used to smell fresh, citrusy, slightly musky and good! It smelled very fresh. The reformulation smells nothing like the old one. It is a totally different and disgusting scent that smells musty and sick.",02/03/25 16:33,kandykat

The citrus is soft and disappears really quickly (as citrus tends to do) but it's nice to smell on the initial spray

The rest of the fruits / flowers / woods are only there if you're looking for them, not very pronounced.

Really cheap price tag though and overall a good frag",01/29/25 17:55,EternalFatalist
CK One Calvin Klein,"I vividly remember when this fragrance came out in the 90's. I've adored it for years. That being said, it seems like the formula and notes have subtly changed over time.

CK One Calvin Klein,"CK one is one of mi favorite fragrances. I'm not very objective about this scent, since I've loved it since I was a teenager. Started to wear it back in the 2000's, at that time there was a lot of advertising for the Calvin Klein brand, on television and specifically, a lot of advertising for this fragrance. I started using it when I was in high school, and since then I have always had a bottle, whether in its original version or some of their summer flankers, and other flankers that they have made. I find it so timeless and it looks so good on any skin. It's not the most long-lasting fragrance, but due to its cost we can apply it without suffering for the price. At the top, what I perceive most are the Citrus notes, I am not able to perceive the other fruits. As it dries, what I notice is a set of green, floral, and woody notes. When it dries completely, it leaves a musky and powdery feeling. It is a fragrance that has given me many compliments over the years from both men and women.",01/22/25 01:40,MsAd89
CK One Calvin Klein,"The hate for this fragrance is way unwarranted. I don't think it smells outdated or like dryer sheets at all, it's pretty synthetic though. This is a great cheap citrus fragrance with mid longevity (as you would expect). If you need something light, youthful, and fresh for a cheap price this checks all the boxes. It isn't unique but it's as inoffensive as it gets and does what it's made to do.",01/20/25 10:58,MeraMaybe

CK One Calvin Klein,"Oh the days where I had a 200ml bottle of this, and would wear this everyday in spring and summer. This fragrance was a hallmark for me in my mid to late teens and even early twenties. The upvoted pros about it being a carefree, optimistic fragrance that brings about positive feelings might be inherently because of the 2nd most upvoted con: it reminds people of high-school era. The scent is nothing special, but I do recall getting complimented a lot while wearing it. It's a bit like a Labrador Retriever: a great safe choice as a first fragrance, loved by many, always happy to see you, hard to dislike but also will never surprise you.",01/18/25 06:04,LCSLCSLCS
CK One Calvin Klein,This is a classic that a lot of people love but I unfortunately cannot get myself to like it. It smells like mens deodorant to me. The citrus is too bitter and weirdly powdery. I find it to smell quite nice on men though.,01/17/25 22:18,emicherri

The bottle is likely from the early 2000s and is the only reference point I've got for what this fragrance smells like.

CK One Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein One is a leading unisex fragrance. Its prominent citrus notes are well-suited for warmer weather. The scent evokes a casual, shopping at the mall experience.

Personally, I find the soapy undertones unappealing. However, this characteristic may be a positive attribute for others.

Sillage and longevity are moderate, lasting approximately three to four hours.

In summary, I rate it 5/10",12/17/24 23:49,Eventic
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Wow has this been reformulated! I don't often mention reformulations, but Truth for Men no longer smells like it used to. I have a Coty bottle that kinda-sorta resembles the vintage version in the first two minutes, and then it veers into a totally different territory. The vintage stuff from the 2000s was gummy-fresh/green in feel, very dewey and fruity, sweet but not gourmand, and extremely short-lived, maybe thirty minutes of noticeable sillage before it practically vanished. The current version is drier, more basil-forward (herbal) and with a lick of artemisia that negates its former sweetness in favor of woodiness. I'd wonder if I had a counterfeit bottle, except no counterfeiter in his right mind would attempt this bottle, and also the longevity is now respectable, at eight hours. Everything works well, the sprayer, the color of the juice is correct, and the fragrance bears a resemblance to the note pyramid, but this smells more like an herb garden after a rain shower than the lush rainforest melons that it used to be. Weird.",08/31/25 20:16,karlovonamesti

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Huge difference between paper and skin.

On paper this comes off mostly one note: a more synthetic, $2 deodorant version of the Aventus pineapple top note. You can sort of detect some nuance, but barely. The note leans a bit more watery, more rain than ocean. But still synthetic, cheap.

On skin it’s incredible. I get something like a mass appealing Le Labo Baie 19, minus the dirt and concrete. Here those are replaced by, not oud, but something in that direction. (I’m guessing that’s the “exotic woods” note.)

Overall clean and fresh, petrichor, far more interesting (on skin) than the brand, bottle or price make it out to be.

Very 90s, very nostalgic.

Great scent.

UPDATE: 11/9/25 I love this more and more as time goes on. Idk know what it is but it's just a great scent all around. Performance hits above its price range. Another incredible Almairac creation.",07/13/25 10:41,ErnestBeaux

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"One of the GOAT cheapies ever made. Seriously, it's been at it's exact same price point for over 20 years now, with no end in sight as this is as accessible today as it was when it first came out. If you've been around collecting frags for as long as I have, you know this era (late 90s-early 2000s) was all about the greens. Much like how the blue fragrance trend has boomed in the past 10 years or so. Truth Men could very well be the poster boy for green during its heyday.

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"An easy to love ultra clean scent. Juicy basil and dewy grass brightened by soft cardamom. There's a very wet pear in there as well. Transparent and aquatic à la early 2000s. Rather one-note: it lingers on the very bright (at times cloying) top notes until the end. Becomes a skin scent very quickly but does last for a good while, at least on my skin. Unique in the market of most ""fresh"" men's fragrances.

The very synthetic woody backbone is what prevents this from being exceptional—a very scratchy sandalwood persists throughout (I smell Sandela). Still, there's something addictive about it. Satisfying to wear on a warm day, though cloying on especially hot days.",12/30/24 13:50,ateneo_ldb

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,I gave this a lot of chance but the initial appreciation that I had for it exponentially went downhill. Even thinking of this makes me nauseous. The scent just rubs me the wrong way. It's airy and fresh alright but the green notes are just too cloying for me. Maybe it is the fern note because Patrick by Fragrances of Ireland also made me sick. It also has a fern note. I remember I tried that while vacationing in Ireland and I was sick the whole day.

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Bought this after noticing so many positive reviews and finding it for about $30. I don't have the perspective to rank it among other 90s or 2000s men's releases, but I find it very generic. Right from the start it's a classic soapy-fresh kind of grassy fougere with a subtle resinous quality in the base. A little sour, sharp, and acqueous. The soft pastel green of the bottle matches the scent profile well. Further on the balance gets a little denser, warmer, and just a tad musky like freshly laundered clothes. Again the emphasis is towards soaps, clean linens, and white musks within a watery-fresh structure. The dewy grass impression is nice in the first half hour or so, but it's not necessarily photorealistic or anything super interesting. Perhaps it's best strength is being an uncomplicated green fragrance that creates a grassy aquatic accord without vetiver or citrus. It's certainly not ""the best"" in any category I can imagine, but it is pleasent.",01/01/24 15:14,mlke

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Super easy going and underrated. It starts a bit synthetic but within like a minute it settles to this clean aquatic bright green. Easy to wear, not particularly amazing, but unique for a summer freshie. Recommend.",06/20/23 13:15,discardedandroid
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Great fresh green fragrance that's IMO underrated and overlooked. Seamless construction with a classy and refreshing spring/summer scent profile.

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"One of the best value cheapies I've picked up, and perfect for spring. Calvin Klein Truth is a dewy, green, grassy, freshie without being utterly generic, synthetic, or relying on the familiar designer tropes. Although it does open with a familiar early 2000s type of feel, this dissipates and smooths out to feel like a pleasant fresh breeze carrying some sunny spring warmth.

Truth runs adjacent to Costume National Cyber Garden, as they both feel like they are touching on the same concept of capturing spring in a bottle, but with some digitized/synthetic aspects that work well with the more natural smelling aspects in both. Side by side they don't really smell that similar, but they are in the same wheelhouse.

Truth definitely runs somewhat counter to the listed notes. I do get some light fruitiness not listed (without cloying sweetness) that mixes with the green notes nicely. No deep resins or heavy patchouli to be found to my nose. The woody-ish base is gentle and provides some nice balance to the sharper open and mid.

@talkaboutscents sums up the technical side and analyzes of Truth very well, and much better than I, so definitely check out their review.

This does not smell super unique, or niche, or like it is going to be a revelation. Just a pleasant, light experience that provides some nice contrast in my collection of smoky, woody, incensed, heavier scents. I could see Truth smelling generic to more seasoned noses, but to me it just smells nice and easy, like Sunday morning on a warm spring day.",05/07/23 11:13,MaxMellows

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"I confess that I bought this as a total blind buy. I wanted a spring/summer scent and saw that it scored over 4 on the reviews and purchased it because it was on special for $29 (Australian) for 100ml. Yes, I’m a cheapskate. Haha.

Anyway, this scent is much better than I anticipated. Very classy and perfect for warm weather. Nice to have a summer scent not dominated by citrus notes. This has a fresh woody smell and green leaf smell. Dry down smells like fresh sawdust with the basil and cardamom in the background which is very pleasant to my nose. Definitely a winning scent for daytime and outdoors. This would be great at an outdoor table at a cafe and is probably ok for work as well. It is not a powerful scent and won’t last all day. On those counts it’s moderate/ average. The slanted bottle design makes it difficult for me to hold the bottle whilst spraying. Overall, this is one of the better CK fragrances I have tried. Thumbs up for sure!",10/08/22 18:54,Michel Silencieux
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Men perfumes always gave me impression of being suitable especially for summertime, probably because of their freshness and lack of overly sweetness. This one is for sure one of them.

The basil and the cardamom together brought me to the blue sea, as feeling the nice breeze on my skin while sitting on a boat. Meanwhile, fern and resins as the middle notes took me in the green deep forest with the light shinning on my face through the shimmering leaves.

The base scents of cedar, which I know pretty well since I often pick it's leaves from the tree and smell it while walking in the forest, together with patchouli and wood, embraces the whole mixture and wakes my senses up in such a way that, I couldn't avoid to think I truly ""truthly"" enjoy it.

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Was going to leave a nice long review but can't touch @talkaboutscents

Agree on all accounts. I initially came across it in my search for a nice outdoorsy, petrichor, woody scent. I tried the Encre Noire's and few other vetivers but weren't for me. I reeally like the heavy ozone with Xyrena's Neon Sunset but finding the sweet florals of it tend to lean more feminine.

With CK Truth, I get the freshly cut green grass/ basil up front and then sandalwood on the drydown. Wish it would last longer; maybe get 2 or so hours before needing to reapply. Usually do about 7-8 sprays on pulse points and chest. I'll get the random whiffs of the sandalwood for a few hours after the green opening settles down. But where it really shines in the drydown is high heat weather. That's when I get more of the nice sandalwood.

Would also enjoy another flanker that includes heavy ozone like Neon Sunset or the complete petrichor scent like Narciso Rodriguez for Him (replace the sandalwood drydown with violet for the ozone and much more patchouli for earthy tones). Would be really awesome to have the fresh cut wet grass in the opening and then petrichor/ ozone/ earthy/ wet concrete on the drydown. If anyone reading this knows of another scent that emulates something like this let me know!

But for now it's in my heavy rotation for spring and summer; perfect for going to a backyard BBQ!",09/13/22 13:54,throw2542
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"@talkaboutscents ... best ""heart-to-heart talk/review"" ... honest review! 😌",08/08/22 22:32,BASMAJ
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Some reviewers said it rightfully so - this is without a doubt the definition of underrated. Most of you might relate, and those who can't relate, perhaps will relate in the future when they are at that stage after smelling/using hundreds, if not thousands of fragrances only to reach to the realization that some of these underrated, now-cheapies from yesteryear are actually, amazing blends. Calvin Klein - Truth is straight up there at the top category in my opinion when it comes to the decade of 00.

It is strikingly similar to Comme des Garcons - Odeur 71, which came 2 years earlier than Truth, and is considered an art piece by many but I think many fall into the illusion of CdG’s genius marketing and descriptions. You won’t see people losing their minds under Truth reviews :)

Now let's look at the announced (marketing) notes. I can see how it doesn't always resonate with some people. Resins? Patchouli? Exotic woods? Huh? The only notes that really makes sense and can be noticed are the green/grassy accord (not a single note), basil (with anisic-sweet fresh herbal at the top), cardamom (giving fresh spicy kick but hardly noticeable on its own, likely because it is carved into the blend itself and its effect can only be understood if we had the chance to smell the formula without).

My notes interpretation from what I could catch within my experience of perfume ingredients (and some information from the books I read) would be:

Basil - Pineapple - Pear
Green grass, leaves - Cardamom - Galbanum
Sandalwood - Cedarwood - Calone (Aquatic notes)

Green/Grassy top accord: Triplal (common green leafy aldehyde), Galbanum EO with its sharp green balsamic mastic gum nuances)

Fruity-green top accord: Dynascone (common pineapple-galbanum ingredient, also key top-heart in Aventus) and touch of lemon/bergamot (limonene, citral, linalool). There is also a violet (ionones) note with a pineapple-pear-green ingredient to give a nice shade of fruity pear effect. This is where the connections made by most people to Dior - Higher, and it is accurate.

Spicy-top-heart: Sweet basil oil (anisic, fresh herbal), cardamom seed oil (spicy citrusy and terpenic fresh) - these create an amazing accord in combination with the green and fruity top.

Musky-woody base: There's Calone (watermelon aquatic watery), white musks, likely Iso E Super and some amber nuanced Cedramber (this combo could be what they market as red cedar) and maybe in combination with cedar virgina oil, and there's definitely sandalwood (what they market as exotic woods) which is Javanol (one of the finest sandalwood synthetics).

For me, Truth's charm comes from this hidden sandalwood note that wraps the entire fruity watery greenery like a blanket.

And the more you learn about perfumery, these so-called ""cheapies"" that are brutally disregarded (most likely because people see them as outdated or the brand/marketing is not appealing to snob-perfumeheads) shine in a different light. Always remember that perfumery sales is driven mostly based on marketing and not based on ingredients (even though marketing likes to lie about ""finest ingredients, highest quality ingredients"" etc). There is no finest, rarest, highest quality ingredients in mass production. There is only one thing, economical production.

I was never one to use a perfume for its hype or status, but purely by its scent and the feeling it gave me. Lanvin Oxygene, Issey Miyake - Bleu d'Issey, Carolina Herrera - 212 Men, Dior - Higher, Tommy by Tommy Hilfiger, Givenchy - Blue Label, Armani Lui/He and many more...These are amazing value for price today, and CK - Truth stands right there with them.

So use this and others that ""you"" like regardless of what the impression is in full confidence knowing you are not spraying something much inferior to, say, one of those expensive Maison Francis Kurkdjian's Aqua Celestia, Forte, Masculin etc...",07/29/22 19:06,talkaboutscents

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Light Green Aquatic, with surprisingly rich and well blended woody resinous dry down

Just blind ordered this for $23, for 100ml/3.4oz new in box.

If everyone is right that this is CK’s best and/or most underrated men’s fragrance this may become my favorite cheapie this spring. Will update when I receive it.

Update: I really like it, it opens almost like a green aquatic. It has that ozonic vibe overused in blue aquatics but here paired nicely with fougere greens. Then with a touch of resinous woods and dash of sweetness that come to the forefront in the dry down. Smells great throughout.

It’s hard not to like, with the formulaic 90s designer cologne vibe, but unique enough that it makes a very nice option for spring and summer. The richer dry down makes it stand out for a cheapie. In some ways it’s almost like they took some nice facets from a bunch of different popular 90s department store scents and distilled them here, the Polos, the Tommy‘s, the CKs, etc. etc. Really a no-brainer at 23 bucks.

Though I have to agree with many reviews that the atomizer/sprayer on this is absolutely the worst I’ve ever seen. It’s a big rectangle of plastic that feels loose and wobbly and ridiculously cheap. and then when you push it a pretty small amount of mist weakly sprays out.",04/24/22 21:55,jaxxin
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Had this and sold it a while back, which I kind of regret now! I may buy again as I think it would be a great warmer spring day scent. It's fresh and uplifting, watery green and modern (not modern as in ambrox etc), ie not dated smelling. It is a simple, linear scent though, nothing complex but extremely likeable if you want an uncomplicated easy going fragrance.

A good alternative to other inexpensive, simple, fresh scents such as Nautica Voyage. I'm surprised more people don't talk about this CK, but I guess it's becoming rarer as it's now discontinued.",04/05/22 04:49,Dark Owl
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Now this is an underrated fragrance. The opening note just hits you with this amazing basil note. It isn’t foody or too earthy, but fresh and clean.

Many years ago I bought it again, I think in 2014. But the content was already too weak, I mean sillage is only 1 meter and the longivity is only 1.2 hours.
The most likely that the making have been stopped in 2010-2012 for instance and only the residual stocks are available. So the parfume is ""tired"" or lost its real power, exposed to extreme heat or cold etc.
I would buy it again but afraid that the same experince will happen again.

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"This does have a pleasant, soapy fresh green / herbaceous smell - Very relaxed and casual, with some slightly warmer woody nuances as it dries down. The Resins in the mid I assume are what gives the green accords a slightly sweet touch... It is a solid smelling fragrance.

Problem is... As many have stated, this has terrible performance. After an hour, it's a faint skin scent... Going heavy on sprays doesn't help all that much either. For $20-ish, it's not a bad office, casual, out-the-shower type scent... But... I'd more then likely look to put that $20 toward a different fragrance.",07/19/21 08:06,House Adams

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"I still have my original bottle from 2002. I remember buying this for full department store price for over a 100$ bucks, this was long before online fragrance discounters were around. I was getting low and decided to re-up for a new bottle. They are almost identical, the only difference being that my 2020 bottle seems to not last as long.

I looked on here just to be sure I haven’t already left a review, and I’m a bit surprised I didn’t leave one.

There’s absolutely nothing negative to say about this stuff. It’s a green freshie that is so aromatically pleasing that it should deserve all of the praise it gets really. For my nose it’s tough to explain what this smells like really. The basil an cardamom combo in the opening works quite well. This has the typical CK trademark of colognes too, it’s so exceptional to smell and wear that you feel like a million bucks while wearing it. My original 2002 bottle I could easily get anywhere from 7-8 hours upon spraying, it felt like it stuck to your skin, but sadly with my 2020 bottle, I can seem to only get 3-4 hours. However, given that I only paid about 30$ bucks for a 100ml bottle, I’m more than happy because it still also smells the same. Normally when wearing a cologne usually one area does better than the other, sometimes it’s the opening that shines, and sometimes it’s the drydown that shines. To me, this one does extremely well in all areas, the opening, mid, and drydown.

It’s got a fresh clean laundry type of vibe too. To my nose it has that sweet spicy commercial type of vibe that you get from other popular designers, but it’s not obnoxious either. This is a personal favourite of my mine from the CK house, and I remember finding out about it through those cologne peel and sniff adverts from early 2000 magazines. It’s an extremely underrated cologne and if you find it, don’t hesitate in getting it. To me this is quite original in nature too. Solid 9/10 from me.",05/30/21 15:53,DaedalusX
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"For me this is a really nice scent. It smells very good and it's hard not to like it. The plus's outweigh the minus's by far and below are some excellent and fair reviews which sum it up nicely. Longevity is moderate around 5+hrs on my skin and projection is at arms length. For me a solid 8 out of 10. The value is very good too and you can pick up 100ml for around £20/$30 which is a steal!

I can't think of a scenario where this would be disliked at all. I really wish I had tried this one sooner. The performance is also good with solid projection. I give this a 95/100.,01/29/21 20:18,Criglett Clussnum
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"I had a bottle of this kicking around unopened for about 15 years. After experiencing 2020, I figured, how bad can this be, and decided to open it.

Contrary to what people here are saying, this stuff lasts a long time. True, half of it disappears in a few hours, but what remains lasts and lasts in fleeting puffs. A three spritz application from the day before woke me out of a deep sleep the next morning!
(Half asleep, I was sure someone was in my shower and purposely poured out a full bottle of shampoo.)

It is a green scent for sure, but I’ve never smelled anything in nature that exactly resembles this. It is kind of a perfumy synthetic fresh cut grass smell. Almost as if the mower traversing the lawn also sliced a few unseen cans of Axe Deodorant open in the cutting process. Not offensive, and not all that bad.

I’m not sure the significance of the tilted bottle. Is it that the Truth can easily be bent?... and for anyone anal enough that wants to keep the chrome top beautiful and pristine, it needs a wipe each time due to the oily blow back from spritzing.

A chemist could tell you the exact aquatic molecule you have in numerous fragrances, but I can't name it. The nose Almairac has created iconic, fabulous fragrances. Take a moment to click on his name and be surprised and impressed!

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Finally I got myself a bottle of this, a blind buy, it had been on my radar for years!

Well, my first impressions are good. I honestly wasn't expecting too much given that this doesn't really get hyped a lot. I wasn't expecting a strong fragrance, which it isn't, but I was expecting a fresh, make that VERY fresh & uplifting fragrance which it most definitely is. This somehow reminds me a little of Clinique's Happy for men, or rather how that would smell if you replaced the citrus for green notes! Both share a similar bright, uplifting vibe.

I may be wrong but another fragrance I recall having some similarities was I think 'Higher' by Dior. Anyway, I like this, it's seemingly a simple, easy-going light scent, great as an alternative to citrus scents on a hot day! In a way it's kind of unique yet familiar at the same time. I also don't think it smells dated at all. Try it before it disappears for good as it's been discontinued for a while now.

This could be the ideal choice for the introvert, someone who wears fragrance solely for themselves and doesn't care about making a statement. If you HATE Dior's Sauvage you might LOVE this!

Truth for women has the same damp dewy character. Many male/female companion fragrances actually smell little alike (Obsession for instance) but Truth is essentially the same fragrance with more florals for the women and some spice and (to my nose) a very faint ozonic effect in the opening of the men's version. On me the women's version has greater sillage and longevity.

They don't occupy the extreme ends of masculine and feminine; instead they both linger in the centre of the gender spectrum. Like brogues, trench coats and crisp white button-down shirts.",08/15/20 23:39,Annemarie

Truth smells like a beautiful sunny spring morning in the forrest after a rainy night. The sour citrus is great, not dissimilar to Acqua di gio. I love it obviously. (Not a hint of modern sweetness that frankly is sickening how they have taken over all male designer scents post 2015.)

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"When I had it, I splashed myself in this super fresh frag. I swear I thought I smelled some fresh bamboo, or bamboo leaves, or raindrops on bamboo... That's very green and refreshing.

This is not the citrusy or airy type of fresh. Not like Dior Homme Cologne which is super fresh and invigorating. But this is wet kind of fresh. Like walking into cool rain in bamboo forest type of fresh. Like getting splashed with Gatorade in your face as you're reaching the finish line of your marathon.

It smells sour fresh, not sweet, not powdery. Super light. Too bad no staying power whatsoever. Although it's expected from CK and especially with these kind of notes.",12/25/19 20:57,Bargain Hunter
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Delicious! So perfect for hot summer and spring days. It opens so fresh and zesty, there’s a strong herby note at first, and then it calms down to a really smooth and fresh aquatic type scent. As another reviewer had said, there’s no strong note here, it seems to be a few different notes blended exquisitely to create something truly unique.

Calvin Klein fragrances aren’t overly expensive, this was only about $50 for 100mls, but I’m finding that mostly they’re pretty decent quality for the price. The longevity on this is average, as you’d expect, but I find that the projection is above average, I’m certainly leaving a trail after this.

It’s a winner if you ask me. When it’s super hot and you need something to cool you down and get you smelling perfectly gorgeous, I certainly recommend reaching for this. The only downside is the hideous shaped bottle.",11/20/19 00:11,aussiecolognelover88

I really enjoy this scent, it's the crispest herbal aroma ever, this is what I imagine when I think of the ""fougere"" accord. The opening is so refreshing, sweet basil, tarragon,cardamom, thyme and coriander. There's a powerful ozonic effect that ""smells"" like rain. A super clean patchouli develops along with a cyclamen type of accord, and a tomato leaf, adding depth to the mid and base and adding structure to those bright spice/herbal notes. It's almost like a small kitchen garden on a moist morning, absolutely wonderful. It's very linear, the drydown leaning a bit more woody/spicy as the top notes fade away.

I'm getting an agua fresca with basil and rosemary. As it dries, a sweet ozonic green note and with a cedary base comes forward. This reminds me of a aromatic version of Terranova Rain--in fact I layered these two together and now its softer and more suitable for a woman. Later, I layered Truth for Women over top. All layering experiments came out very refreshing, especially in this 100F weather we're having in California.",09/14/19 18:20,colorfulmess
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"The notes list surprises me because I smell a lot of a Cactus or Aloe Vera like smell in the opening, it has a also a kind of ""hairgel"" vibe to it but in a good way. It's also ""wet"", i don't know which notes cause that rainy or wet effect. Smells clean, fresh, natural and a bit tropical but in an original way, like walking in a lush and green landscape.

Perfect for spring, summer and early fall. I absolutely love the opening/first hour of this cologne but the drydown gets a bit flat.

The notes i get the most are: Green leaves, Cardamom and Fern, i'd add Cactus and Aloe Vera to this list because it sounds obvious to me.

It's fresh but not an aquatic fragrance, green but not bitter, uplifting but not citrusy, tropical but not sweet. It reminds me a bit of a non-gourmand fresher version of Reveal.

It's the kind of scent you could catch a whiff of and think this is the natural scent from somebody.",09/06/19 07:32,Celeria
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,Sold my bottle was too weak as shown in the votes above.,02/10/19 07:16,richmilton
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"I absolutely love this fragrance.

My experiences with Calvin Klein's Truth began when I purchased a 100 mL bottle of it for just €25 at TKMaxx earlier last year. I had always liked Calvin Klein fragrances, and this one turned out to be no different.

The overall appeal of the fragrance is certainly very green. Like the fresh morning dew on cold grass, the top notes cut through the air like a sharp sickle being thrown at winter grass. This cold, bright green accord struck me the moment I sprayed some of the scent from the angular, edgy bottle.

Truth then skillfully intertwines notes of silky woods with the green accords to reveal a satisfying, modern middle. It's probably not one of the most unique fragrances I've ever tried, but is definitely one of the most pleasant ones. With its soft, cardamom-patchouli accord, Truth is very, very easy to wear - day or night.

Remaining fairly linear throughout its presence, Truth concludes with a soft trail of cedary woods and powdery, musky patchouli. This drydown is soothing and lasts a long time, despite remaining relatively close to the skin.

Whenever I'm in the mood for something uncomplicated, Truth is the bottle I always reach for. The fragrances exudes character and class; it's safe, and yet, exuberant. The bottle is a great representation of the vivid juice it houses.

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,Till now the ugliest and worst fragrance i had ever smelled.,10/29/18 13:23,martial eagle
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,Y'all don't know anything and your noses don't work. This smells 90% like Gucci guilty Black. Aromatic fougere and predominantly green. Nice for spring and for hot days. I don't know what y'all talking about sillage or maybe you got something old but 1-2 sprays were more than enough for me to last quite a 8-10 hours. On the whole a very nice and fresh fragrance. Would give it 7/10,07/25/18 07:20,hj290191
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"It would easily be in my top 10 of summer fragrances if it had better longevity. I have a huge collection so that's saying something. It has such a wonderful summery vibe with its green/grassy, clean notes. The Basil in this screams summer without smelling like a garden salad like some other fragrances with basil or similar green notes.

If you have a large fragrance collection in this genre you may find Truth For Men to be redundant. Otherwise, it's worth the current $15-$20 price tag. However, I suggest you take along a decant because this barely lasts 1-2 hours. Pity for a fragrance with such a beautiful summer composition.

Ssshhh the Truth is..... its weak.",07/24/18 07:11,richmilton

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"i blind bought this from marshall's because the reviews here told me it was grassy; i like grassy. i sprayed it on in the parking lot and regretted my impulsive nature. it smelled green-ish but not grassy per se. it smelled very generic in that it didn't smell like anything specific, it reminded me of other things i recognized but couldn't identify by name.

now, several hours into the drydown, i'm getting an intense basil, which is supposed to be up in the top notes according to the note breakdown. it's like,how much more basil could this be? the answer is, none, none more basil.

simple, beautiful, classic. every movie in every cinema is about basil. basil sells.",05/25/18 01:35,weaselface
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Summer lime and mint perfume it's really just a bit sweet.

But longevity is really poor too bad",05/18/18 18:24,olimpius
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"To cut this short, this smells exactly like a wet field of grass during the rain. It's quite evocative of that scent and really fantastic. CK Truth for Women also smells like that, but more like a lush meadow with some flowers as well. I've been looking for a cologne to encapsulate the smell of rain and wet grass (""petrichor"") for a long time, and I have to say this is the greatest example of that in my experience. If I'm looking for individual notes though, I basically smell grass, leaves, a watery accord, cardamom, and basil. Since it's very atmospheric, it doesn't lean masculine or feminine but CK Truth for Women is definitely in the feminine direction. As a perfume, it's probably my favourite from the CK line as it isn't sweet at all (like CK Eternity is), isn't as bitter as CK Euphoria, and isn't as fleeting as other CK colognes. It smells like the word ""melancholy"", but is very pleasant and inoffensive. Sillage is however only moderate but leaning light (as is the case with most CK perfumes) while longevity is also moderate. The bottle for this is very interesting, but the sprayer is really bad. However, I can overlook these issues because it provides a fantastic sensory experience if you want to smell like a wet field of grass during a rainshower.

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein truth is a very under-rated gem from the house of Calvin Klein and I’m very surprised this isn’t more popular because it’s very mass pleasing and has gotten me some compliments from time to time !

Truth opens up with a very bright,Dewey,slightly juicy but fresh green note that to my nose is 1 of those fresh cut grass smells similar to Carolina Herrera 212 men but this is more aromatic and less musky. Truth is pretty linear but once it dries down the patchouli and sandalwood kick in making this slightly sweeter but also more earthy.

To describe this scent as a whole id say this is very green,natural smelling and this reminds me of the smell of fresh cut grass after a nice rain. For those familiar with the Bath n Body works lotion “Rainkissed leaves”, this smells very similar to that !

Performance— some people are saying this doesn’t last but on my skin I get 5-8 hours with above average projection. This scent is perfect for spring/summer use and would be a great scent for the office as it’s very inoffensive if you only use 2-4 sprays.

Overall rating— 8 out of 10 ! A personal favorite of mine that I’m positive if this was released by Hermes that this would be a hit ! A perfect Spring scent

Sidenote: This is a less is more fragrance ! 3-4 sprays mad if your indoors and 4-6 max if your outdoors. You may think because this is a light scent that it won’t be cloying but if over applied it can be headache inducing. BUT if done right it’s the perfect scent for the office that may get you noticed but will still be inoffensive for even sensitive noses",03/18/18 08:01,Ryanmmas26
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"When looking at it’s accords, I wouldn’t think I’d like it. I always look for the smells that have aquatic citrus and woody notes, BUT THIS , THIS IS MY FAVORITE SMELL EVER EVER EVER EVER!! To me it smells like an aqua kind of smell! Its my favorite PERIOD! And it’s cheap as sin",10/10/17 20:26,CMTHUNDERS
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"I'd forgotten about this one off and on over the years, as it was one I wore most often when it first came out. It was one of my first selective purchases. I'd started in high school with Old Spice, graduated to Cool Water and Drakkar Noir, landed on CK Eternity and Obsession when I was a little older, and wore most of the 90's culture at some point. These were buys made on TV commercials, sexy ads and clever ads. Some I liked, some were just culture in my area. Truth was the first one where I went to buy the standard Obsession et al, and met a lady working the counter of a department store and she had me sample a few other things. Truth stood out as a less sweet, more refined smell than CK's other offerings. It was less spicy than, um, Old Spice and so different than Drakkar and Brut and Polo, the other things I'd grown up with in the early 90's. I bought it cuz I liked it, and wasn't there for it specifically, I selected it. It was magical then, it was mine. It didn't last long, it faded to a skin scent fairly quickly. This is where I learned the power of subtle scents. I went through a series of years wearing this where I would be confident to get a girl close knowing I'd ultimately hear ""mmmm you smell so good"". I think this may be the most complimented scent I've ever worn, but sat so close to the skin only those I was very physically close with could smell it. But it worked, every time, I can't think of a time it didn't. And it really drew them in and I was nuzzled and sniffed and close many a time, and there's probably a lesson in there somewhere. Years passed, Axe body sprays hit the market, things changed, I stopped using the stuff. I have a very old bottle still in my cabinet. About 4 years ago I wore some on a date. Sure enough on a tram ride across town we had to squeeze in tight. She got close and was drawn in, ""mmmm you smell good"", and commence the nuzzling. Still I don't wear it and the same bottle was opened a few weeks back, on a date (I don't date often, despite the story) and ""mmmm you smell good"". I've only been revisiting scents for about a year now. I like projection, staying power, moderate sillage, and have yet to find a genre I love. Projection and sillage are not Truth's truth. And yet, from a ""mmmm"" and nuzzling perspective, this has been my most credited scent. Would it be more effective if it was a power house? I'd say probably not. It'll linger real close after an hour, a good dab behind each ear on the pulse. Even my old bottle. A long review, but this has been an on again, off again thing with Truth for a decade and a half for me. It has served a singular successful purpose for me every time, so it deserves some words. Should someone be in the market for a scent that no one knows you're wearing until you are close, and you want to be closer, this may be your Truth.",10/04/17 19:10,couchninja1
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,Hallelujah! I went thru many irritating cologne blind buys to get to this. I found it at Burlington for $25 for the 3.4oz. OMG so clean and fresh! no headache-y citrus fruit or irritating heady smells; just this can't offend! I feel confident and clean and dare I say this but this has the refreshing notes from Dior Higher's opening note or a Tommy Hilfiger cologne but without all the woods (Dior Higher) or heady fruits (Tommy). The fragrance has a cool minty green soft clean spicy vibe. And it don't smell like Lacoste essential as another viewer saidLacoste is a beautiful Florida Everglades green with a touch of Chrome Azzaro. This is almost mint green a touch of moss and soft clean patchouli,09/13/17 14:11,Eau de Nikita

After CK Be, Truth came out and then CK went through an average period of putting out just average colognes (see also CK free), Truth ended up being one of the average ones as compared to their high standards, they've since gotten back on the creativity boat with all the yearly summer scents, CK Gold, CK Dark Obsession, and CK man which is a big change from the light, citrus scents we all know CK for.

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Truth is a bit of a strange one for me.

At first I thought it was a little weak and one dimensional, then 3 hours later it really seemed to find its teeth. This scent (for me anyway) starts out quiet and gets stronger as the day goes on.

Longevity for me was good, especially for a CK fragrance.
Very green (almost to the point of being over the top) but a great scent IMHO, quite different to other scents from this house. Just be aware that the user can get noise-blind to it so don't over apply.

Would say this would be great for an outdoors guy, as someone who grew up in Ireland I find a certain comfort from these type of scents as I tend to go a little stir-crazy living in a big city.

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Truth for Men by Calvin Klein is a herbal (or green) and fresh fragrance. This fragrance gives a feeling of being in a garden pruned or watered recently, it is very nice, very fresh.
I am not sure if it smells exactly the notes that are declared, but everything that reminds me is about grazing fields, meadows, grasses, ie, that smells of green, and very well done, it makes you feel energetic (the but me). I can not find many changes in its development, it is very similar from start to finish, but at the end its feels more woodsy.
Its projection is moderate to low, however unlike many other opinions about their longevity on my laster about 12 hrs. although close to the skin.
It is a perfect scent for daytime use both in spring and summer, best of all is that you can find very cheap and I do not think its aroma is so common now.",04/04/16 11:45,caifan

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Green, green, green. Spring in a bottle. Not a typical Calvin Klien and no relationshp to other CK fragrances- a true breakout original for this house. Stock up, because the sales are not strong enough for CK to carry this much longer.

Main Notes:
Begins with an almost herbal note, but quickly develops to a full fresh green/fougere, after about 6-7 hours it dries down to a clean multi-woods. This is the only one from the Calvin K. house worth purchasing.

Season:
Spring and summer with the best results in a temp range of 80-95 F. Humidity improves the longevity and silage.

Association:
My association is fresh cut grass and a drifts of a lush wet woods.

Use:
Appropriate for daytime wear. Casual. Inoffensive and unisex. A pick me up, cool me down, freshen me kind of fragrance. Stand out from other ""summer"" fragrances. Blind buy is safe if you like green/fugere fragrances.

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Fresh and fresh again. It is my feeling when I put on this fragrance. The opening starts with fresh herbal scent that is a little spicy. It reminds me spring in mountainous area after after a rain in the morning. That is why I like to wear it in the morning.
Both longevity and projection are acceptable according to the price. It lasts 4 to 5 hours and all the time you can feel the projection. I think the silage is around your arm length which is enough for daily usage. Although after 5 hours It is needed to refresh, The scent cab be smelled on the skin with an slight projection.
I think It is wearable for daily casual activities such as doing sport, shopping, visit a friend. I've found it a little informal for wearing in the office or formal parties. Absolutely summer and spring scent.

Update: after 12 hours I can still detect this. Faintly, but it's there. So if you want to smell like grass for 12 hours at skin level, this is what you need.

What's especially notable about it is that it's light and transparent in the style of a Jean-Claude Ellena-designed Hermes scent.

This is really a warm weather fragrance. It seems to come alive when it's hot. When it's cold, it just sort of - sullenly lurks.

My son wears it - fortunately for me he has two bottles and gave me one!",07/01/13 21:59,wesleyhclark

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"To me, this smells a lot like oxygene pour homme om opening. As it dries down, it turns a bit dryer and woodier, unlike oxygene thats very linear. I got it because of all the good reviews. I like green spicy frags and almost everyone commended the longevity and sillage. I however, find the projection to be very mild and subtle. The longevity is good though, about 6 hours on my dry skin. I'd recommend this to someone in their teens to early 20's. Good date night/office scent. Very non offensive. I prefer eternity/ obsession/ck one shock as far as ck frags go. Not bad.

Edit: After smelling this on someone else, I loved it! It may be much stronger than the user thinks it is or this guy was wearing half the bottle because he filled an entire room. It smelled like a very damp, musky, sweet/green forest.",09/24/12 23:30,dancinleroy

He is now nearing 18 years old and has vowed to never part with it. He has gone through bottle after bottle, and searches small fragrance shops to find it.
It is quite the amazing scent. It's very fresh and uplifting. It is never overpowering or too much. It's very clean, but alluring. This is my favorite scent for men, but I could never imagine it on any other guy in my life other than my brother.",07/23/12 09:50,tygrrrlily505

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Verde muy verde. Así se podría resumir esta fragancia

Aunque es fresca se diferencia de muchas otras tipo "" summer "".

El cedro y el cardamomo se pueden diferenciar claramente, aunque no consigo oler cláramente el pachuli.

Primaveral - veraniega, aunque podría ser perfecta para las personas que le cansan los olores pesados y/o persistentes.

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"I bought this for my son for his birthday, and got a chance to smell it on him for the first time yesterday. A woman's perspective is this is an attention getter! I was very surprised by how much depth the cardamom adds. On him, basil, sandalwood, cardamom come in together. Then, the patchouli and juniper. Pepper is very subtle, adding an edge- which is good, because there is a sweetness to this fragrance. Make no mistake, guys- it's fully loaded with testosterone! Contrary to some reviews, I would actually consider it to be almost a sillage monster. So don't think because you can no longer smell it that we can't. Truth definitely has attitude... Best fitting a man who is sophisticated, but also knows how to chop wood.
UPDATE: My son has recently become seriously involved with a beautiful Bosnian girl who insists that he wear this cologne over any of his others (1 Million, DSquared, Bvlgari Extreme). She LOVES it, makes her crazy!",03/10/12 19:46,camaral

The smell is so addictive, really unique, nothing quite like it really. I'd never get bored of it, and it seems to last so much longer than any aftershave/perfume I've ever come across. I once knew someone who wore this scent all the time and I thought it was purely his own scent that smelt so amazing...until I recognised the smell at the duty free shops in the airport.

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"No doubt this is an aromatic fougere. If you enjoy the scent of fresh cut grass (that is the opening note). If you enjoy the soft woody smell of forest aromatics (that is your dry down). Projection is medium and this makes for one of the best office daytime fragrances. Longevity is amazing for a Calvin Klein fragrance (average 6-8 hours on skin and 10-20 hours on clothes). It is green and clean with an under warmth of the wood.

Calvin Klein Truth for men.. First impression..

okay this is only a little 15 ml splash bottle,im gunna do the best i can, remember its a first impression..ok this smells like a different version of ck one the unisex bottle to me, just its more fresher i think its actually very different i like it, i think im smelling the patchouli and the cardamonm and the red cedar blended together it smells very nice i think thats what it is at the top, it smells very aromatic or herbal or green i cant put my toungue on it but its not like spicy its aromatic and calm or more of a casual smell i think,

ok so far with the top notes i love it, ill do a full review later on ;p

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Truth for Men is one of the nicest green aromatic scents around. Because it is so likable, I will not hesitate to place this fragrance into a unisex category.

This fragrance opens with clean and crisp 'metallic greens', with a subtle hint of pepper. The scent is rather fresh, although not overly Summery or too watery, it has substance.

Surprisingly this fragrance strikes me as being very natural, like the scent of grass on the floor of a forest and a man that has showered with spicy soap. Truth for Men is almost luscious and smooth.

It's not what I'd call particularly sexy, however on a man, it's very approachable. Through discovering this fragrance, I've realised that green scents work way better on men. Those grassy and earthy notes could suit practically any man, despite his personality, style or age.

The lasting strength of Truth for Men is great, as is the sillage, although not powerful, has a great projection. In my opinion this is the perfect choice for a man seeking a naturalistic, clean fragrance at a reasonable price.",11/10/10 23:02,missk

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"'Tell the truth, but always with a slant'...hence the shape of the bottle and the idea behind the scent.

According to cK's website this is still available in the US and the notes above are not what is in MY bottle. I(and anyone who has worn and enjoyed this fresh green wonder) can tell you that these are more like it:

TOP: bamboo,watery greens,tea leaves
HEART: basil,cardamom,green jasmine
BASE: sun musk,white patchouli,cedar...
and wacapou(Indian for pine)
(These are right from CK website)

TfM begins with an aqueous suspension of lush and green foliage, smooth, fresh and luminous. The initial accord fades but surrounds what follows with a verdant shimmer until the end. The aromatic basil (I love basil) is softened by cardamom's smooth warmth and these two notes blend in with the sexy clear jasmine like lovers in a menage a trois, innocent, curious and sensual all at once. The musk here truly smells as if the sun is shining on everything in this scent, and the patchouli (if any) is quite clean and lite. The cedar is there but in more of a background way and never overpowers our 'green lovers'. The wacapou (that took a while to find and define) is the green of the still living needles and not the wood or the pungent sap-smell of Christmas trees. If you are looking for something truly, naturally green (but not overly herbal) and watery(but not aquatic or caloney) this is the one for you.Despite the surprising lack of citruses Givaudan has captured 'fresh and succulent' rather well.

Simple and beautiful, like Truth itself, but with a slight twist, as if the truth is told but something has been held back to protect the feelings or innocence of someone you truly care about...

Sillage: good
Longevity: could be better
Overall: 4.75/5

This is a true wonder of modern perfumery in that it smells so very natural and pure but is composed of mostly synthetic components. This is the perfect synthesis of natural essences and man-made materials. The life of the scent is short-lived but as with all things in Nature, nothing lasts forever...",08/27/10 06:40,gypsy parfumista
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"A very pleasant surprise at first!
A fresh and vivid green watery-citrused sparkle when out of the bottle, but it lacks more solid base notes to convey the scent deeper and longer (like vetiver, sandalwood or cedar) and what remains on the skin after moderate spray is a slight grassy-lime scent.
I miss pepper in the heart notes to give more body to this very good scent.
I liked Dune by Dior better, which was tried on the same day. It had the same vegetal opening with much more consistency and longetivity.",08/10/10 14:04,electric_wood
Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"Another classic from cK.
Very green with subtle woody notes, and a little sour. But this sourness is not citric type, u know some plants have sour green leaves, so this is that kind of sourness.

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"One of the greenest, fruitiest things out there. I really like Truth, but to me it suffers in a way that almost all Calvin Klein frags do - it's just too weak and doesn't last very long. What is it with CK being so topical in dimension? Anyway, you get a very nice, fresh, bamboo and leaf vibe from Truth for Men. Give it 5 or 6 spritzes in the morning and it should last until lunch.

Truth For Men Calvin Klein,"This is so far the BEST CK Men's fragrance I ever come across!!

It start with a very refreshing ""bamboo"" or ""grass cutting"" smell, slowly then transform to a mild, nice green scent with hints of bit sourness, imagine the after rain freshness in the middle of the bamboo rain forest! Amazing journey! It end with a very mild musky aromatic scent with overall lasting power more than 4 hours! It stay closed to skin and projection I would say is okay, a very self-pleased mood lifting scent. I love to wear it to the office and casual dating, great compliments from a lot of my friends.

Truth is an amazing and attracting fragrance, the scent calm my busy day down and relax my mind and nerve giving me state of peace and harmony feeling - a definite magic potion for me!

The bottle design is in the line of simplistic and modern looking! The story behind this ascending bottle design is something interesting!
"" Tell all the truth, but tell it slant"" - No one want to hear a bad lie, tell a slanted truth then!

This fragrance is totally under-rated by the market, a great scent that should have huge success! Btw, I got info from some site citing that it has been discontinued.

Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Putting excessive amounts of Iso-E Super in a fragrance is a lottery - some people perceive it normally, while others are completely anosmic to it. I only came to understand this after buying DH 2020, which is also based on generous amounts of the molecule. Actually, these two share quite a few notes - bergamot and pepper in the top, vetiver and cashmere note in the base, and, of course the cedar note courtesy of the aforementioned Iso-E. Contrary to what most reviewers say about the performance, this can last a good 10 hours on my skin, but analogous to DH 2020, it does not project crazily and seemingly disappears only to reappear later on, which is the distinctive feature of this elusive woody molecule contained therein. Sadly, that might be the reason this was ditched not long after its launch, despite being (in my humble opinion) the one Eternity flanker with the most natural ingredients. Nobody was able to tolerate this elusive performance in 2016 and still many are not able to tolerate it in the era of the new DH 2020 - even more now maybe, in the era obsessed with loud beastmode fragrances. If you are still able to find it for a decent price, give it a go, spray further away from your nose, don't sniff your arms every 2 minutes and you might appreciate the subtle elegance this offers.",06/01/25 06:04,southboy

Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,Not a great fragrance for me. Opening has fantastic peppery citrus and floral notes. It seems promising. This quickly fades away within minutes and I am left with a sort of mixed floral mess on my skin. The residual smell isn’t that pleasant to my nose and tends to linger. Let me explain…my late mother once asked me to grab a tissue out of her handbag for her. After searching around the bottom of her bag I was left with a fragrance similar to this on my hands…a mixed floral scent that wasn’t that pleasant. Basically it’s a mixture of makeup and spilled floral scents with a bit of saturated cloth thrown in. Not something that I want to smell on my skin. That Iris note is not for me with the combination of the other scent notes. I wouldn’t buy this again.,09/10/22 05:49,Michel Silencieux
Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"It is a pleasant fragrance, a very safe to be around everyone without being cloying.

Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"This is one of those fragrances that could've been an absolute hit but fell short in a big way. Don't get me wrong the fragrance itself is amazing, when you can actually smell anything. It's so weak and has zero longevity that you really have to put your nose up to your skin or shirt to smell it. On clothing you may get some longevity and a modicum of projection. When you actually get to enjoy it there's a crisp woody clean aura with a touch of citrus tea and pepper mingling to smooth it all out. If CK had dialed this in to actually last I'd adore it but sadly it's only a faint whisper of what it should have been.",12/05/21 16:35,CreepyKid
Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"CK was close to having a very solid Eternity flanker with Intense... You can tell that they were onto something, but it does end up falling a bit short for me. I will say... I like the fragrance. But with the note breakdown and being an ""Intense"" flanker, I was expecting something richer, spicier and more... Intense.

I like the White Pepper, Grapefruit, Black Tea opening... It's spicy, masculine, very aromatic. The Iris and Rhubarb make an appearance and along with the Lavender take the scent over. As it reaches the deep dry down you're left with the light woody notes that make up the base. After about 2 hours, it just becomes a little nondescript... It's fresh, slightly spicy and woody, with small hints of the Iris. But the notes that make the fragrance somewhat unique, are just gone... It doesn't retain the notes you would want and it also doesn't develop.

Again, I do like it... It's a solid office scent, nice change of pace once in a while. Just wish it would have been crafted with the same approach CK took with Eternity EDP.",08/05/21 13:49,House Adams
Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,I like this scent and its got nothing on the original Eternity. Intense has its own characteristics and personality and I agree with the above this scent relying upon the Irris! The open is unusual too and I'm not sure I like it yet but the best part of the fragrance is the middle section which is very plesant indeed! I give this 6.5 out of 10.,01/08/21 17:59,johnjubal1958
Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I rocked the first Eternity when it first came out, and it was a good performer and crowd pleaser. Now Intense, to me it is smoother that the original with a little less sharpness. I get almost moderate performance with it. I love fragrances with pepper. This is not as peppery as Suavage, or Modest Une but it is there for me. Anyway bang for the buck it smells good and you won’t offend anyone and you may even get a complement or two. I really like the flanker “Flame” it is pineapple base, and no....it’s not trying to smell like Aventus! Anyway I think CK has had some great hits, like Shock and some that did not do as well.",11/20/20 08:56,Napasonoma
Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,For me I get the Rhubarb and the Iris quite a bit. These are the two notes I notice the most in the beginning and it's pretty good so far. This definitely has a Dior Homme similarity but it is a little bit different. The Rhubarb note takes this in a different direction and it has a slight sweetness to it that sets it apart. I think this is a good fragrance to have if you want a cheaper alternative to Dior Homme and if you enjoy CK fragrances. I got a 6.7 oz bottle for $40 and I'm glad I bought it. This could smell really good to a woman I think but I haven't had confirmation just yet. I think you could wear this on a date. The drydown of this is nice. Don't listen to the haters on this one.

Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"What’s with all of the hate guys? This is not the first time I’m seeing a lot of you reviewers crap on colognes. You guys need to be careful with that. Too much negativity makes me wonder things that normally wouldn’t ever cross my mind. Fake reviewers, people who are toxic, and to be honest all of this negativity is now giving me vibes of reddit. Reddit has the worst reputation for toxic people and their comments. If you guys are going to trash a scent, try and give your explanations in an adult manner. Don’t just put something unintelligent like “ ugh this smells like puke and cotton candy”, I’ve literally seen a comment like that on another review, this kind of stuff makes me scratch my head. I understand that people are allowed to have opinions but too much negativity starts to become a little strange. I’m not a white night hero for Calvin Klein, and I get that they have had their fair share of hits and duds, but 12 reviews on poor longevity? 16 reviews for poor silage? Come on guys... This stuff if oversprayed has the ability to clear out a room and I’m not joking. Something isn’t adding up here. I’m now skeptical when I see the lot of you guys crap on a scent with such low scores, makes me wonder if half of you just hate Calvin-Klein based on bad experiences from previous purchases and now hate just to hate, or are the competition. Anyway, I get shades of Christian Dior Homme, but in the dry down that’s where things start to change. This is a beautiful scent that does NOT deserve the hate it gets in here.
On my skin I get 6-8 hours and the silage is moderate, but go easy on the sprays. I get Iris, lavender, wood, grapefruit, geranium, and Cashmere as the dominant notes.",02/26/19 13:39,DaedalusX
Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I normally wouldn’t take the time to review a flanker from Calvin Klein, however, I see users have dumped on this fragrance heavily and I wanted to point out some reasons not to.

Let’s get the name, “Intense”, out of the way first. Is it? Definitely not, however, it’s really not as bad a performer for me. Still, it’s not outstanding, so that hurts my rating of this fragrance. Just spray your clothes for better performance.

I get a lot of iris and geranium, some pepper, rhubarb, and the freshness of the citruses up top. I definitely think the comparisons between this and Dior Homme or Dior Homme Eau are valid. The iris is the main note and smells similar. I don’t get much longevity from newer batches of Dior Homme or Homme Eau, either.

This is heavily discounted online, so pick it up on the cheap. Do not pay retail prices for anything from Calvin Klein, or Coty, or any other fragrance for goodness sake! This is why I think it’s not so bad.

Overall, it’s a pleasant smelling fragrance that works well in any season, day or night, any occasion. Performance is honestly average, with decent projection for the first 90 minutes. Reapply with this one once it fades, it’s not going to break the bank if you purchased it from a discounter. Really, it’s similar to the two Dior fragrances and the performance is the same for me, so all things considered it’s good.

Definitely try before you buy. Coty produces the most samples than any other fragrance company I’ve seen, so ask your SA before you pull the trigger.",01/31/19 15:55,scottpiper
Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I bought this for only $9.99 for a 3.4 oz bottle at TJ Maxx (quite a bargain!). Not bad, especially at the price I paid. I can definitely detect the DNA of the original Eternity for Men, but this one smells a bit more updated, a bit...fresher(?) Longevity isn't the best, but unlike other reviewers, I am at least getting far more than 30 minutes fortunately. Maybe 4-5 hours longevity. I can definitely still detect Eternity Intense after 4 hours, but just as a skin scent. This slightly enigmatic scent pays a bit of tribute to original Eternity, as well as being evocative of Sauvage, Bleu de Chanel, and those types of fragrances. A definite ""like,"" but not love, from me.",11/19/18 21:54,jdfarley

Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I like CK fragrances, generally. But, why oh why do companies produce fragrances that don't last. Not just CK either. I'd rather they didn't bother. It's a pet hate of mine.",08/05/18 01:14,RobbieX

Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Eternity Intense is a complete misnomer because it certainly doesn't last an eternity and there is nothing intense about this fragrance; it is a lighter/fresher type scent that disappears in 30-60 minutes. Not good...

In a nutshell, Eternity Intense does not remind me of Eternity in any form or fashion (which I respect, but now smells dated to me) and, in fact, that iris accord reminds me quite a bit of Dior Homme. On a positive note, it doesn't smell as bad as DH and, to be honest, the fact it is such a weak performer is good news. It lacks originality, does not smell good, and is not very well composed IMO.

Overall, shame and disappointment await anyone who samples this less-than-stellar fragrances. The only Eternity worth considering is Eternity Aqua on the men's side IMO. On a positive note, I got to sample CK One Summer 2018 and I'll be picking-up a bottle when it hits the deep-discount market.",06/03/18 11:19,GodKing
Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"This fragrance had gone within 30 minutes!! The longevity is 1 hour on my wrist.. I think should have been called ""Eternity Office"" It's very closed and serious environment like the office scent.",06/01/18 21:58,chairat.luck.pluem
Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"This should have been called ""Eternity Office"". There is nothing intense about the fragrance whatsoever, and I really have to wonder what they were thinking when creating and naming it.

That being said, it works very very well as an office scent for me. There is a somewhat unspoken no-fragrance policy where I work, and I've actually been sent home by my boss to shower off my fragrance before. Eternity Intense is so powdery-light and unoffensive, that I have been wearing it to my office the last three days and no one has said a word. I'm not sure if they can smell it, but I get whiffs off it every so often. I don't mind having my own personal fragrance bubble at work, and then spraying on some more serious stuff when get off.

So while the name is absolutely bizarre, the fragrance itself is pleasant to me and is serving a great purpose.

If you want something similar but with bigger projection, more longevity, sweeter iris, and more complexity, check out Eternity Intense for WOMEN. It's everything I originally wanted from the men's version, and is absolutely unisex.

**5/15/18 edit**: Welp, so much for all that. Two sprays on the chest and one on each hand this morning. Boss walks into the office and flips out on me saying I'm smelling up the whole place. I can barely smell it. One co-worker confirms she can smell it well throughout the office. Weird.",04/19/18 07:27,EvanOz85
Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I bought this one at my local retailer at a discount and here is what i think of it:

Pros: This scent is perfect for a very closed and serious environment like the office. It is inoffensive and not cloying at all therefore no one will complaint of headache. It has a soapy smell like dior sauvage and i can say that it is a mixture between Dior Sauvage and Dior Homme Eau. The poor longevity and projection is also not a problem for me during work.

Cons: I will never wear this to any evening occasion. The smell is just too boring and 1 dimensional. It is not seductive, exciting or playful at all. And the poor longevity and projection is a problem when I’m out and about in the evening

Conclusion: i would not call this a bad fragrance. I just think that it is not versatile and only serves for work and not anything else at all. For me there is no such thing as a ‘bad fragrance’. Every fragrance has its own strength and purpose.. well.. except for Secretion Magnifique..",03/29/18 22:55,yusrin_1993

Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Had to do an actual review on this. A few comments below i said this smells like a right guard deodorant i wore 20 years ago, as an insult and a dismissal. That was a few months ago in much cooler weather. This scent is an absolute let down in the cold months, even if its note base and scent profile read otherwise.
So today, I'm just in the mood to buy a fragrance. Im at the mall, trying to convince myself to get Dior homme eau. Love the original, but have balked at homme eau. It is ""too much"" to me. Too much iris, and way too sweet in its presentation, especially when it is considered a warm weather fragrance. Ive tried to buy it but just cannot. I then thought of eternity intense, its poor performance, its note breakdown, and then thought: ""it has iris in it but is not an overpowering iris, nor is it sweet. Perhaps it makes sense in the heat of summer"".
Put a few sprays on, walked around for a bit, and ultimately bought a big bottle. I know this thing is getting its teeth kicked in by reviewers, but i am going to make a case for it for those interested. Powdery iris and citrus, smoky in the opening,nice spice, floral, you get a sense of the original for a moment or two. Citrus burns off and the iris, bit of smoke, woods, and soapiness, and that is where the scent sits for the duration. Where i found homme eau to be a bit obnoxious, intense is calmer, more wearable, and very versatile. Just a really nice fresh, clean, soapy scent that does not over project and will not offend anyone. I have actually gotten a few compliments wearing it already.
I paid full price but I am sure you can wait and get it for much less. I'm okay with paying full price for this. I can wear this at my job, my wife loves it, i cannot overapply, and it deviates from fresh citrus and isn't part of the ambroxan army (although i love ambroxan scents) and sits very comfortably in my summer wardrobe and will become a dumb reach. I just dig it. Give it another try, wear it on a hot day and i think it may surprise you. Calvin Klein is very hit or miss, much more miss than hit, but now i will go ahead and buy a bottle of the original eternity. These both serve as nice counterpoints to one another.",07/14/17 20:27,rerthegreat
Eternity for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Gone the days of CK being creative, innovative and leads the market. After the released of Eternity Night, now comes Intense > a smokey ""Night"" version wt a splash of peppery and cirus woody scent for the base.

Any good? Longevity. 3-4 hours on me.

Any bad? The scent is pretty flat, last 3 hours on my skin and honest speaking it is very ordinary smokey warm winter scent.

Any Eternity influences? Little bit - the lavender and some flowery notes lingering behind the smokey scent.

Any more? No. It is a big let down - CK obsession wt the flankers now officially turned to complete madness.

CK All Calvin Klein,"ck all brings a punchy, yet light, fresh vibe to the party. It’s just really clean. Like dryer sheets or febreeze. You could probably not wash your laundry for a few months and just use this instead, scentwise you’d probably get away with it too. But now, “clean” isn’t a scent, and most dryer sheets are scented. So what does it actually smell like? There’s a somewhat sweet/spicy citrusy after-scent. Besides the citrus, I can tell there’s something green/floral going on, but the only thing I can really pick out is the jasmine. (I’m normally not great at distinguishing my flowers but I have this really strong jasmine oil roller that smells similar so I’m gonna assume). I know this is supposed to be a unisex perfume, but there is also a slight musk that makes it seem to lean a little on the masculine side, however, I am very biased. It makes me feel… aroused? Like my boyfriend just came out of the shower with his hair slicked back, with nothing on except the perfume. Yeah. I like this one. It makes me feel clean and sexy and refreshed.

I like it and it's pretty long-lasting, but nothing crazy. 2-3 spritz should last the whole day without being overwhelming.",08/24/25 16:30,tweesyweesy
CK All Calvin Klein,"Alberto ""The Freshmaker"" Morillas of Office for Men fame remakes his 1994 hit ""CK One"" for modern audiences. generally, this smells a lot like that fragrance but with less 90s musk/powder and with more 2010s zest/soap. as a massive CK One stan, this was a shoo-in for me.

beautifully cheap in a jumbo size, CK All is a top candidate for uncomplicatedly hosing yourself down with before anxiously grocery shopping during peak hours because you need green onions, going to the cinema alone to see a bad movie based on a kid's video game franchise, running to the smoke shop at midnight because you forgot you smoked your last paper yesterday, or any other sort of low-stakes situation where you want the cheapest of the cheap, the lightest of the light, the dumbest of the dumb reaches.

to do more service to the smells of CK All than ""it's ck one but more newer lol,"" it's primarily a citrus and white floral fragrance with a giant focus on clean. simple, all-gender freshness. the opening is a blast of incredibly strong and sharp citrus, like ZAP! BANG! cleaner citrus. after the opening chills out, the citrus sourness sweetens up and smells a bit like tearing your nails into a warm orange peel in the summer, which i really love.

the mid is a white floral affair with a little bit of grapefruit (and some rhubarb maybe?) adding a little zing to keep things from going too soapy or old school. at this stage, the fragrance is doing a balancing act between a ""shower gel fresh"" fragrance and a ""hotel soap fresh"" fragrance. the floral notes here are pleasantly clean and a touch sweet. there is also an understated greenness that feels like a vestigial trait left over from CK One's DNA. has a little bit of an ""italian neroli summer fragrance"" vibe around this mark. toward the bottom, the citrus cools off a little more and the musk starts to warm things up a bit.

drydown is sort of just a vague mélange of soap florals and musk with the ghost of some grapefruit rind. if you've ever smelled a Nivea for Men product, it smells like those after the lotion has settled in. there's something barely woody about it if you put your nose right to the skin.

projection on this stuff is negligible and it lasts for about as long as the Alan Smithee broadcast re-cut of David Lynch's Dune. (i had to find a way to namedrop him in here, god rest his soul) when i said ""hose yourself down,"" i was not joking, i go 6 sprays with this stuff without even thinking. from the notes and the description, you probably inferred that this is best in the summer days, and you'd be right. in fact, i recommend it most when it's boiling hot because someone might actually be able to smell it on you. this is the second most unisex fragrance i've ever smelled besides CK2, which i guess makes sense because they sorta carved out the unisex fragrance market.

and that's your approximately 3 hours wearing CK All. (or CK One Sport Eau Fraiche if Calvin Klein was your average european designer house) For the 20 bucks i spent at Burlington on a jumbo of this stuff, i could not be more pleased. for a hot weather turbo-budget number, this is surprisingly unique and fun without being challenging or complicated in any way. warmly recommended to any fans of clean, simple, citrus-forward fragrances that are looking for something a little different than normal.

CK All Calvin Klein,"CK All is a fragrance I’ve had for some time, but to be honest, I don't use it that much. It’s fresh, clean, and very easy to wear — the kind of scent that's perfect if you just want to feel light and comfortable without overthinking it.

It opens with a nice burst of citrus and soft florals that feels really modern and relaxed. I appreciate how versatile it is and how it can work for almost anyone, any day. But for me, it’s not the kind of perfume that leaves a strong impression.

It stays quite close to the skin after a while, and even though it smells good, it doesn’t have that ""wow"" factor I usually look for, especially when I want my fragrance to stand out. That’s probably why it doesn’t make it into my rotation as often.

That said, I still think CK All is a solid choice if you’re after something minimalistic, casual, and very ""easygoing."" It’s just not the scent I reach for when I really want to make a statement.",04/26/25 15:19,James Gertok

CK All Calvin Klein,"For the longest of times I've always been a stickler for avoiding CK Fragrances as a whole- never thought I'd get on with them. Recently though, that's changing. It started with CK eternity - i received a little tester of it with a perfume purchase, immediately fell in love with the ruggedness of that scent. Then the other day, I realised I forgot to wear a perfume, nipped into my local Savers, and saw CK All on offer, around £15 for 100ml - thought that's a fantastic price. Went to sample it and by golly, was it a pleasant and wonderful scent.

It's sweet, it's smooth, it's unisex, it's comforting, it's relaxing, it's electrifying. Any perfume that has been handled by Alberto Morillas, is like an elixir of the gods. Always fantastic scents from Mr Morillas, and this is no exception.

The nice tart opening from the citrus, to the smooth and mellow middle Jasmine and Rhubarb (they dominate in the middle) all the way down to the basenotes of Musk, Amber and Vetiver. It's a very relaxing and calming scent- like being enveloped in a blanket of pure comfort and safety.

Very much so unisex, some people say it leans more feminine and i do somewhat agree with that statement. But it develops and works beautifully on my skin. It's not a perfume that will get you attention, it doesn't scream attention, it screams class, and sophistication. People who are in close proximity will smell this scent and they'll be intoxicated by the subtle nuiances of that perfume. Perfect blind buy fragrance- and for the price, it isn't bad at all.

Perfect for the warmer weather we have coming up in the UK, so I'm excited to test it out fully in the heat of the UK sun. Overall, I reccomend this perfume to just about anyone.",03/31/25 05:14,BigMommyMilkers

CK All Calvin Klein,"I've had this fragrance for over a year and I can say the next:

It opens synthetic with mandarin and bergamot very citrussy, which although it's synthetic, I still really enjoy it.
Then you get the white florals which is where the line is drawn to where it shows this is a unisex fragrance. Some people say it might be too feminine. But to me it's how feminine you think white flowers are. To me they don't have gender.
As it dries down you barely get any amber and musk.
The sillage is not crazy, I always put 3-4 sprays and can say this is not enough to make yourself loud. However I always found out that most people actually enjoy just simple not loud fresh fragrances. So this the one I've had most complements with.

Simple fresh citrus unisex fragrance. For men, only if you think you can pull off flowers and sweet citrus. It projects decent up to 3 hours, then skin scent lasting up to 6 hours on my skin. I like it a lot since it was my first ever fragrance. 8/10",01/26/25 23:52,paalvarez7

Still, it's incredibly good; it delivers white florals and citrus with an undertone of syrupy sweetness. The scent profile reminds me a bit of Dunhill Icon.
If you're on the fence about it, I'd buy it, because it seems genuinely impossible that someone would hate this fragrance, unless only for the mediocre performance.",08/24/24 11:42,dgjeans
CK All Calvin Klein,This is marketed as unisex but it does have a feminine floral aura. It is rather soft and subdued. I think this will do better in warmer weather.,08/05/24 10:15,Roman86
CK All Calvin Klein,"If an AI had been tasked to ""do"" a Jean-Claude Ellena (not the Ellena of Cartier's Declaration as the prophetic one, for a spell, of Bulgari's Thé Vert), this is what it would smell like.

Everything in CK All feels sharply synthetic, from the sour candied mandarine through the flowery center and its plastic rhubarb down to the vetiver that was born in the lab and evidently never set foot in Reunion or roamed Tamil Nadu. It is radical in its simplicity, bracing on first whiff, certainly inhuman, inarguably unisex: On those rare occasions when I now wear it, I feel like one of Jeff Koons' Balloon-dogs, ready to bark in autotune.

If I had money to waste and did not already own a bottle of CK All, I'd ask Koons to make me one in white, a dog that is, which to my knowledge he never did.",07/17/24 11:27,Silenos

CK All Calvin Klein,"This is one of these scents you personally need to get your nose on. At first, I was hesitant about it. Reading the comments here on Fragrantica and the reviews on YouTube. I got my nose on it and it is really unisex. Nothing to Feminine or Masculine about it. It opens very zesty fruits, you have florals and some musk and amber. It's very inoffensive and you can over-spray this one. I use this for casual days/nights or just for the office. Performance wise, I get around 2 - 4 hours on skin and I'm ok with that. Spray in clothing and your clothes will smell like a nice luxury softener, it smells good.",04/05/24 04:53,Omar11

CK All Calvin Klein,"Starts off sharp and lovely, certainly unisex. Initial dry down leans creamy and masculine. After an hour it becomes more feminine leaning. It continues to transform from first spray on, something I find rare in most fragrances and am really surprised about with this one. I really love it! Easy wear, well blended, complex, actually lasted all day on my skin and certainly my clothes. Good projection. 6.7oz bottle was $30.",02/03/24 15:04,CurlGurl

CK All Calvin Klein,"This is Not half bad, opens up with a pretty nauseating Air freshener kinda smell but after about 5 mins it dries down into a bit sweeter and smoother smell, I just keep this in my gym bag if i just want to spray something real quick that i know i will eventually shower off anyway, performance is maybe 3 hours maximum, and sillage is very skin intimate but Its an EDT so that's expected.
For a Gym smell its not bad at all but there are still so many better alternatives for this price range (if even less)
if you're thinking about using this as a Main smell during the summer

CK All Calvin Klein,"This is a really good fragrance! I picked it up cheap at a discount store. I really enjoy CK One, and some of the summer flankers as well. I can’t say anymore about it that the other reviewers haven’t except that when I sprayed it in my car on the way home because it smells so good to me, about an hour after I returned home, I ask my husband to grab something out of it for me and he came back inside asking me why my car smells like donuts??? I went right out there and yes it did indeed smell like donuts😂 so there’s that. I smelled fresh and citrus like, but in my car, donuts🤷♀️",12/28/23 12:01,JaneDough
CK All Calvin Klein,"A great combination of 4 white florals gives this a fresh, slightly creamy feel to go along with the citrus brightness & amber sweetness. I'm not a big fan of Calvin Klein or summer fragrances & was surprised how much I like this.

CK All Calvin Klein,"It has the CK One vibe but it's like a stripped version, more creamy floral, much less musky; kinda smells like a moisturizer when it dries. I like it for sports and exercising since it's super non invasive, you can go wild with the sprays, and lasts about three hours which is nice longevity for physical activities. I prefer it on fabric and on the air (room spray lol) than on my skin since it's crispier ☀️ and the florals go a bit sour on my skin.",10/28/23 20:20,_Aerides

CK All Calvin Klein,"It's an amazing fragrance and I love it a lot.

Quite different than CK One, imo. CK One has a very distinctive and domineering jasmine note on top of all the other floral notes in that one. I can't really detect that jasmine note at all with CK All despite it being listed. Instead, CK All smells very generically super ""clean"" and fresh. As if you were getting freshly cleaned laundry right out of the dryer that had been treated with a fresh smelling fabric softener + dryer sheets. It's almost too fresh smelling; there's a bit of artificiality in this overwhelmingly ""clean"" note, but I personally quite like it.

Basically turns into a skin scent after about an hour, but I find that the scent lingers on the skin about 1-2 hours longer than CK One.

I agree with another reviewer who said it smells like a better Versace VPH. I can detect some similar notes beneath that ""clean"" note that reminds me of VPH, but overall the scent profile with CK All is much more pleasing than VPH to me.",08/28/23 23:31,magnanimousjohn
CK All Calvin Klein,"Beautiful clean fragrance that makes you feel so fresh, well-groomed and put together, super palatable and non-offensive, Very well blended and natural scent that's perfect for very hot days, the office, travelling etc. as it adds a touch of flowery/musky freshness without overwhelming.

CK All Calvin Klein,"Citrus fresh, feel good unisex scent that I really enjoy. I am old enough to have been part of the original CK One craze back in the day and I loved that scent profile. This is for sure like the original, but different enough to my nose to enjoy each of them in a different way. I would say they are from the same family if that makes sense. So perfect on a summer day, appropriate for many occasions when you want to smell good but not overpower anyone. Glad to have it in my collection.",06/28/23 10:06,Sherlock Ness Monster
CK All Calvin Klein,"The citrus really pops in the opening, with the mandarin taking the lead there. The soft white florals and the musk kick in almost immediately and it's really a smooth pleasant combination. The rhubarb and jasmine work really well together in the mid and I wonder why more unisex fragrances haven't tried this combo. The citrus pushes really well through the whole wearing for the fragrance, which is unusual, especially for a less expensive scent. The drydown is a little muskier, but the citrus, jasmine-rhubarb and amber keep the sweetness strong, but not cloying. This was built for smelling fresh and sweet in the hot weather, and it is really good at that. I get a strong 2 feet of projection and 5-6 hours of wear out of this, and the warmer the weather the better with no top end to the temperature. Perfect for the gym, an afternoon drink at an outdoor bar, or a walk along the beach or through the mall.

Admittedly, I've enjoyed many CK fragrances with this bottle shape over the past three decades, and this one did take the concept in a direction close to the original CK One, but more modern and smoother. It's a shame this one didn't fare better in the eyes of the company, but still I think this influenced some of the CK One summer flankers for the better. My favorite in the line is between this and Summer Daze... I think that kumquat in the Summer Daze still puts it over the top for me, but I will get a lot of use of this one this summer.",06/11/23 15:17,IceMell
CK All Calvin Klein,"The quintessential white tee fragrance for men and women. The combination of mandarin orange, bergamot and grapefruit blossom is brilliant. It invokes a Mediterranean feeling and makes the fragrance feel much more expensive than it really is and would probably make a perfect vacation scent. From opening to base, the fragrance is incredible smooth and pleasant. This type of perfumery reminds me of the way Chanel does citruses where it there is a creamy undertone that makes the fragrance alluring and invites you to come back for more. Performance is pretty solid, I get a good 5-6 hours of longevity with good sillage. Contrary to what I've heard about CK fragrances performing badly, this was a wonderful surprise. IMO, this is better than Lacoste Blanc and on the same tier as Legend Spirit. Overall, this an alluring summer fragrance that lives up to its hype, very happy with the purchase.",06/05/23 23:50,masongap
CK All Calvin Klein,"CK All I think is a forgotten fragrance. It is forgotten as it is overshadowed by CK One and CK Be as well as its eventual replacement CK Everyone. Unlike CK Everyone, it did not get a flanker. CK All was a fragrance made to be like CK One, CK Be and CK2 where it was another unisex fragrance. That said it is a good one.

CK All comes off as a fragrance that smells like CK One but I think simplified, cleaned up and smoothed out. CK All opens with a mix of grapefruit with some bergamot. The mid is jasmine and I love jasmine. The base really is just musk and some woods to me (maybe a sandalwood as that can be musky or give a clean musk scent.)

CK All is a fragrance that can be worn in many occasions except dressed up or clubbing for spring and summer. Performance isn't that strong, but I wouldn't say it is a total negative as this is a clean fragrance.

CK All when found in discounters which is hitting a second wind in the rack stores for some reason is really a good buy. I can say it is unisex and works as a clean fragrance. I rate CK All a 7.6 out of 10. I do personally like Chrome and Pitbull Cuba Man better for similar fragrances, but this isn't a bad option and you could do much worse in the CK___ line. I'm personally looking at Everyone and Be.",06/01/23 23:39,mkpunk
CK All Calvin Klein,"First of all - love the simplicity of the bottle. Hate the screw-on sprayer that doesn't fit aesthetically. It looks like a random sprayer you bought on Amazon that doesn't exactly fit the bottle but works ""well enough"". If I could I would paint it white.

Smells fresh, like a cool summer morning when the dew is still on the grass. You walk through the grass in your sandals and your feet get a little bit chilly but the warmth slowly creeps in the air. It's not too sweet. It's crisp. Like a cousin of a green apple without any of the artificial appleness. Rhubarb in the middle notes saves the scent from being too flowery
The perfect balance of unisex for me. Can imagine it being a signature scent that fits both my girl dress days and boy plaid shirt days.",05/24/23 07:30,ArtieWiles

CK All Calvin Klein,"The love child of CK One & CK Be- its really smells like a blend of the two, and in my opinion it is the best out of the three, also last the longest. it seems a common thing to describe a scent using a color: so this is a very 'white' fragrance, it is fresh, clean very soft and slightly powdery. its so subtle and inoffensive, it can be worn first in the morning, without making anyone nauseous. wear it only throughout the summer, it wont make much impact in cold weather
8/10 for me",02/21/23 10:04,TheVman
CK All Calvin Klein,"I can’t get enough of this one… it is one of the most beautifully blended citrus/florals out there and I find it absolutely intoxicating. The fragrance opens with sweet tart citrus. Essentially a mandarin and grapefruit smell (grapefruit blossom + tartness from rhubarb create the tart grapefruit smell). After about 5 mins the white florals come in to add depth and elegance to the overall scent. Luckily, they are all the best white florals- jasmine and lily which blend so easily with the citruses and actually provide a bit of sweetness to the overall scent.
Imo, it is almost perfectly unisex if not just a touch feminine (particularly after the first 5 minutes when the florals start to come in). The Vetiver and tart rhubarb continue to add a touch of masculinity throughout the life of the fragrance. If you are looking for an addicting, versatile and easy-to-wear aquatic, sweet citrus/floral scent this Spring or Summer, I highly recommend CK All. (CK All > CK One)
*An added bonus, is that it is fantastic for layering! Simply layer this to any fragrance that could use some citrus- it blends really well with a lot fragrances I own.",02/02/23 11:24,Rafrosa

CK All Calvin Klein,"My second bottle.
First one few years ago, and after buying a recent batch I can unfortunately say ; this has been reformulated.
Still smells fantastic but tiny bit different maybe more synthetic and projection and longevity are weaker.
I used to absolutely love it.
People were asking what I was wearing.
Now I just like it a lot.
I'm gonna give it a bit more wearing now, few months after buying
Maybe it has matured in a bottle.
Just sprayed it on my forearm and decided to write this review.
It is a beautiful composition

It starts fresh and sunny and it develops into a creamy, almost cashmere-y scent, a fresh-out-of-the-shower soapy scent that makes you feel ready for the day.

Got a 50ml for $19.99 at shoppers drug mart. It isn't worth more due to the subpar performance. It is very feminine too; moreso than masculine for being a unisex scent, undoubtedly due to the flowers in it. So your takeway is citrus flower skin scent.

CK All Calvin Klein,"A true unisex fragrance that smells like the Garden of Eden.

I kid thee not; this is the scent that I imagined how the Garden of Eden would smell like.

It is truly beautiful. I loved it from the first sniff.

It's very hard to describe how it smells like, but I'll try.

I don't get a whole lot of citrus from this one. It's unlike the original (which I also love) in that it's not sharp at all, but it also doesn't have any tea note in it.

It smells very smoothly and somewhat creamy... like a bouquet of white flowers but with lots of jasmine. I bet the rhubarb is there to stop the white flowers from being too sharp, thus making it smooth and heavenly. Personally, I get a fresh floral aquatic vibe from it.

CK will be damned if they ever think of discontinuing this. They made the wrong decision discontinuing CK One Platinum (2018) and kept the scentless CK One Gold for no reason. If they're throwing CK All to trash, then they really have extremely poor marketing analysis team. And what did they just come up recently, pray ask? CK Defy?!? Ugh...

Back to CK All. I think this is a fragrance masterpiece - proudly sitting side-by-side with CK One the original. I wouldn't say it's a citrus fragrance but I would definitely catagorise it as white floral aquatic. It's truly unisex and everyone should at least try it, especially if one likes floral fragrances. Of all the CK One flankers that I have smelt, this one takes the cake.

Always.",01/09/22 13:44,washudtoj
CK All Calvin Klein,"When I was growing up in the 90s CK One was the big citrus fresh thing during my middle school years. I couldn't afford anything but my friends who had wealthy parents would wear it and I enjoyed the scent second hand. As an adult who could finally buy fragrances, and the fact CK is cheap now and doesn't cost $100 a bottle like it did in the 90s, I tried CK One and CK All. CK All is leaps and bounds above CK One to me in every regard. Don't get me wrong One is still good but it's not the same as I remember. All on the other hand is a lovely citrus/rhubarb with a touch of florals that pull it all together into a happy sunny scent. It's not your typical white floral and it's not your typical citrus. It has this almost juiced drink like quality to it that reminds me of a citrus punch. Something like a lemonade meets limeade meets orange juice alchemy. I'm pleasantly surprised by how well this fragrance actually works because so many of the CK offerings are shadows of their former glory these days. I get pretty good longevity as well off a few sprays which is nice. There's no cloying, overly sweet, or overly offensive qualities either.",12/14/21 07:57,CreepyKid

CK All Calvin Klein,"Forgive my rambling, I will get to the point, I promise.
Some of my earliest scent memories are talking sniffs of my dads CK Be “sample” that he wore for very special occasions. This was way, way back in the 1990’s. I loved that scent and thought I would be the coolest guy at my school of I could wear Ck Be.

Flash forward almost 30 years… now a fragrance enthusiast, I had tried wearing CK Be, but the new formula has muted what I loved about it, or perhaps the rose coloured glasses of nostalgia warped my expectations. I saw Mr. Persolaise do a 60 second review of Ck All and was intrigued. Blind bought it and fell madly in love.
It is like Ck One and Ck Be had a love child. It’s the best of both worlds. I get a slightly transparent, and joyful mandarin opening, crisp tart rhubarb, followed by creamy white florals. It’s a relaxing scent, a comforting scent.
I spray a little heavy, with this I’m not afraid to, and have received nothing but positive feedback. Ck, you made a beauty, thank you.",07/31/21 07:44,Harley_84
CK All Calvin Klein,"It has a really great smell I must say.

It's clean, fresh and not another generic summer scent. I don't remember smelling another fragrance like this and I can understand that it is vein with CK One but it's a whole other fragrance. I feel it as somewhat more modern but not one that could be perceived as outdated in a few years.

I feel the rhubarb and white flowers the most but I can also feel the presence of something bubblegum-y that's true.

Despite all that I've said unfortunetely there's a catch... its projection and durability on my skin is just so weak...
Within an hour tops I can't smell it anymore... In a couple of minutes the smell is very faint on my skin.

It's a shame because it's such a delicious airy fragrance that it could be so much more than it actually is...",07/27/21 17:40,mishko

I love that scents like this, in my opinioin never out of style.

CK All Calvin Klein,"Always bear in mind that fragrance is all about personal preference, and can be different to each person due to different surrounding circumstances (country, city, personal experience, nostalgic, etc)

I've smelled few high-priced frags, and some mid and low-priced. What I can tell is still, a matter of taste and preference. I like some expensive ones, and hate some others. Likewise for the mid and low priced ones.

CK All is one example for the low priced frag that got me surprised. In fact, I'm in love with this one. Seems like it has all what I (and maybe most of you) need:
- really affordable
- nice scent
- at least, decent performance. You know, we can overspray and re-apply without worrying about the money. In fact, CK All performs really well on me
- complement getter. Yes, almost everyone around me gave liked this and gave me genuine complement

So I say, always give a try. Get a decant if you can, try it yourself and see how your skin your nose and your feeling react to the scent.",06/23/21 04:49,Lukman Pratin
CK All Calvin Klein,"My summer go to fragrance, absolutely amazing wiv the refreshing opening of rhubarb and orange wiv the florals not making it an in your face floral. As it dries down the fruits are still there, but they balance out perfectly with the florals. Very long lasting can still smell on my self after a shower and a long day, another thing I love bout this fragrance is that it has a slight gin and tonic scent to it and I love gin. It’s deffo unisex cos this is coming from a male who only really wears female fragrances and at first when you spray it, yes it can be too strong and overwhelming, but it where’s down perfectly within 15 minutes, so that it’s no suttle and also not headache overwhelming and strong.

CK All Calvin Klein,"Lotta frag snobs here I see. Judging this fragrance on previous Calvin Klein standards. I bet most of the people bad mouthing this had their minds made up about it prior to trying it.
Sure, Calvin Klein has released some pretty dull boring fragrances.
BUT and I repeat, BUT, this one is fantastic. It's a perfect summer fragrance for day time wear. Great for day to day stuff, going to the beach, leisurely weekends, brunch, you name it. A great summertime dumb reach. And for a summer time fragrance this performs well above average. It's always in my rotation alongside some bigger designer names. Probably even slightly above.

Give this one a go guys if you are open minded and not a frag snob. This stuff is not the usual disappointing CK fragrance.",04/17/21 17:16,Diddleydaddy6901234
CK All Calvin Klein,"hmmm... I kinda like this.

It reminds me slightly of Issey Miyake LD Wood & Wood.

Exchange the woods with florals and you get something similar to CK All. CK All is a more unisex fragrance for sure, while Wood & Wood is a touch more masculine. Not a bad fragrance, something appealing about it.",02/04/21 09:54,House Adams
CK All Calvin Klein,"The only good thing about this is that it doesn't cost much.
I love the original ck one, it smells really clean and fresh, I have ck2 which I enjoy, not as much as ck one, but I wear it.
Ck all however... Smells like a man wearing cheap perfume accidentally spilled a big drink all over himself at pub, and then fell asleep on a friend's couch. The not so fresh smell of him the next morning when he wakes up, that's the smell of ck all. And that's not what I want to smell like as a young(ish) woman working with kids.

Very loud, catching yet not so offensive. One flaw is that the projecting longevity is only 2-3 hours strong. BUT, the bottle is huge so decant it and you can always smell ""fresh out the bottle"" for a whole day if you want.

CK All Calvin Klein,"Even though it does really smell like somebody poured a whole glass of Gin&Tonic on you right after the application (as one of the comments mentioned), this scent has surprisingly gotten me the most compliments ever regarding perfumes (from men and women).

CK All Calvin Klein,"I purchased this not very long after it came out in 2017, I was starting to really get into fragrances and I used to mainly wear The Body Shop Fuji Green Tea and a cheap CK One dupe, I was one of those people that wanted to wear a fragrance but didnt (at the time) like wearing fragrance, so for me, those were a very good way of easing me into the world of fragrance.

I still have my 200ml bottle that I purchased in 2017 and I still love and wear it, albiet I wear it during times of olfactive fatigue, not wanting to wear anything imposing and during my down periods, since, it always perks me up.

CK All smells shower gelly, clean, bright and true to its target market, it smells androgynous and has the perfect balance of masculine and feminine. The begamot and mandarin are the most prominent notes on my skin with rhubarb, amber and musk sat in the background rounding off the overall composition.

Its office safe, daily wear safe, perfectly suitable for the gym, its just a good, fresh, all rounder.
Longevity and Silage are decent, silage is soft and close to skin, longevity is, on my skin, excellent with an 8 hours of wear.
Fresh, clean and reasonably priced too.",10/24/20 06:00,GinCatsBooks

It's clean, crisp, refreshing but not without personality. I smell this fragrance and the words 'cute' and 'fun' immediately come to mind.
Its longevity is surprising decent.
And I believe its totally compliment worthy. Especially for the 'clean' scent lovers.

CK All Calvin Klein,"I LOVE THIS SCENT! This is my first Unisex scent i brought and i feel like right after the first spray it mostly feels male, Its all citrus, but after a few mins the floral notes come in and blend perfectly and it gives it the feminine touch. So its perfect for anyone really. Definitely for summer days and nights but you could probably use it year round. I personally would save for Dates and special occasions. I wouldn't recommend this to any guy that prefers mature scents, this is a very playful, guy in his 20's scent imo, but for women, any age is fine!

At first, however, it smells like someone spilled a whole glass of Gin & Tonic on you. That disappears after 30 minutes, and you’re left with a mouthwatering, fresh scent. It’s citrusy, a bit tart, a bit flowery. I agree with others, it’s definitely in the youthful and feminine territory. Inoffensive, but not boring or basic.

Great for the office, as a casual daytime scent or to wear during exercise. Decent sillage, okay longevity (4ish hours).",06/27/20 00:02,Timaka
CK All Calvin Klein,"Oh how awesome!!! I only ""like"" CK One and CK Everyone, they don't necessarily snatch my up and make me go 'Ahhhh...' like this one (but all of the CK freshies over the years have been decent). I do love this one and favorite it.

I won an almost full bottle in a very generous giveaway, I'm so very grateful! I'm not allowing the free gifting to influence my review however, as I remain objective.

This is a little more feminine than One ot Everyone, and I think it's that way because of the rhubarb tartness blended with mandarin and white florals. Many people think *all* citrus is masculine, but I disagree, I think the oranges lean ♀️ It really doesn't matter though, they're all unisex, and even if they weren't, a confident person can get away with wearing most things in the bulk of the male/female continuum.

This one is a little flighter than One, and doesn't have as much protection. However, it performs decently for an EDT and the price point is reasonable enough to overspray, or re-up throughout the day (plus you'll want to on hot summer days, it's refreshing). These CK bottles are some of my favorite even if they're slightly uncreative (and I've always liked CK's vibe anyway, minimalistic and tomboy). It would be easy to tote this around and it's sturdy.

Ironically, I won this, but it's the safest blind buy candidate in my entire collection. I truly would recommend this to anyone of any gender, age, profession or whathaveyou. I will tip my hat to CK because I do think they deliver on their marketing message, and that their fragrances do suit *everyone* or *all*.",05/19/20 22:49,ShadowsofLight
CK All Calvin Klein,"I don't know about the name. I can't see my grandpa or my dad wearing this fragrance. It leans a little more on the feminine side and it's a little sweet. It's kind of a youthful bubblegum fragrance for both men and women. It's for sure unisex. It's also very floral and citrusy fresh. I think this one is pretty good. I like it better than CK One. It's a good everyday, everywhere type of scent. I would wear this in the warm weather and to the gym. I don't think this would be ideal for winter but I think you could make it work if you wanted to. I love the solid white bottle. It will look good on your shelf or dresser. Another thing I get is an almost childish type of smell which is interesting but it's slight. This isn't for the mature man and if you like mature and masculine fragrances stay clear of this. I'm glad I tried this one. I give this an 84/100.",05/12/20 21:43,Criglett Clussnum

After one minute: Green Tea Lotus from Elisabeth Arden!! (the same sweetness, bubble gummy note of lotus flower + green tea) + CK One. It is a little more masculine version of Green Tea Lotus.

After half an hour: more citrusy than CKone, not so spacious and airy as CKOne, more dense. Smells like Fujiyama Succes de Paris (more ""compact"" ""creamy"" copy of CKOne) and Green Tea Lotus - something in between.

CK All Calvin Klein,"The rhubarb with an apple-like smell stars the show. In that tone the fragrance will project for - unfortunately - a very short 30 minutes at most. Afterwards, it sits on the skin on a delicious mix between rhubarb and the floral bouquet dominated by jasmine. The fixation is also a sad 2 or 3 hours (afterwards, it DISAPPEARS from the skin), and this in perfect climatic conditions. Another ""impotent"" masterpiece aroma from CK. One, Be and All: a masterful trifecta. By the way: One, Be and All are 3 very different perfumes and I believe it to the point of concluding that there is no aromatic conflict in having all 3.",02/16/20 13:36,marcel2782

CK All Calvin Klein,"Yet another solid modern release from the Calvin Klein house, I really don't think their scents in recent years get the respect they deserve.

To me this feels like an updated version of CK One. CK All seems a little 'fuller' and a generally stronger scent but they are most certainly of the same ilk. As with CK One, CK Be and the rather brilliant (but quite different) CK2, there's a calming, relaxing, almost cosy side to this fragrance but at the same time it's very vibrant and uplifting.

Although with CK One still around (plus it's dozens of flankers) I'm not sure this one was truly needed (doesn't really bring much new to the table (unlike CK2 for example) but CK All is still a great 'easy reach' and safe kind of scent, an extremely versatile people pleaser, probably a little more feminine than manly (as with CK One) due to the floral notes used but as the name suggests anyone can rock it!

Decent performance for a freshie, around 7 hours.",08/19/19 15:27,TrephineArtist
CK All Calvin Klein,"Initial burst is a masculine musk (not a huge fan of it), but then the gorgeous citruses greens and rhubarb come out.

I do not find the similarities,for me CK All is more on the feminine side. I feel citrus notes at first,then after 30 min the citruses become more faint, leaving place to flowers and some powdery notes till drydown 6 hours later.
Sillage is moderate, longevity around 8 - 10 hours. I feel a vibe of floral soaps from the 90s.
Good for office and professional environment,but nothing to make me buy another bottle. Imo CK One,despite not being such long lasting, has more personality, is more uplifting and fresh.",08/10/19 16:51,Affe24
CK All Calvin Klein,"You know... I love the original but I wouldn't purchase it because the reviews claiming that it's too weak. I decided to buy this one instead. Summer fragrances are not my favorites. I rather like a strong, strange, challenging winter stuff. It was a blind buy, and hey... the best blind buy ever for me. It's rather masculine -girls' reaction- and I don't know how it does that. After the opening of the mandarine it is just florals. And whenever i sniff this on me i am right up in heaven..... for this price definitely give it a try if you're not an ""allthetimealphamale"". It is just so fckn beautiful. If you're not into summer frags but want something unique... give it a go.... floral bomb with some citruses... compliments? If you want that go for some amber bomb.

CK All Calvin Klein,"This is in my top 3 CK frags. At first I didn’t know what to think, as I got a variety pack and had never worn CK one, and was a bit overly cautious about wearing something labeled unisex. I’ll say that while CK one seemed far too feminine for me (for a 30 year old man, it’s not a bad scent though) I almost wrote off CK all as well.

I tried this one a few weeks later, and I love it. It seems to me to be the PERFECT daytime casual scent: fairly light, very pleasant and energizing. Bright and citrusy, yet super fresh and clean, not too sweet. Smooth floral notes balance out the citrus elements, and it really is an incredibly uplifting and refreshing scent, almost edible. I detect lemon or oranges, grapefruit, white flowers, refreshing tea, and light musk and some greens. I feel dumb for ever writing this off simply because it’s unisex.

Edit:
At first I felt CK All leans ever so slightly more towards the masculine side than CK One, and is just overall more pleasing to me.
After repeat wears and tests I am not so sure about this, they’re both a bit too feminine for me to wear constantly, but again, pleasant and well made fragrances.",07/12/19 15:01,Bfreepro417
CK All Calvin Klein,"This is the true worthy successor of the legendary CK One. It gives the same vibe but less musky/woody and more powdery maybe, that comes off as more feminine than the original CK One. The CK Be was a departure from CK One and the One Shock flanker felt more like a Be flanker. CK2 wasn't anything like CK One either. CK All could have been a CK One flanker or the successor CK2, but regardless of the names and lines, CK All is a great scent on it's own. It does seem to last a little longer than it's predecessors which isn't saying much but it's appreciated.

It was a blind buy, and I'm happy with it. For me, it's jeans and Tshirt kind of scent, but it can be an office scent for men and women either.

Update: it is the complete opposite of transparent. And it has a kind of stickiness quality that becomes annoying after a while.",07/05/19 00:15,ashkan_hadizadeh

It's a fresh, clean floral scent. I think it walks the unisex line well. Very pleasant and easy to wear. It lasts a long time and has a soft presence. It doesn't smell strange or groundbreaking but at the same time it doesn't smell like anything I've worn before.",04/14/19 23:53,Oldspice
CK All Calvin Klein,"Very beautiful and actually fairly unique release from CK which is rare !

This opens up with a very bright mix of mandarin and florals and then quickly dries down to a scent that still has that citrus and florals but then the rhubarb comes in giving this a slightly spicy twist and the amber really comes into play making this creamy. I wouldn’t have guessed this was amber though as that creaminess reminds me a lot of coconut.

CK ALL is a great scent but unfortunately on my skin it comes off more feminine than I would like. It strongly resembles L’imperatance by D & G which is probably why I think that but even L’imperatance is more masculine. Still all in a great scent and I’ll have to wear this more in the summer heat for further testing as I’ve only recently worn this in colder and semi warm weather.

Performance on this is great for a summer scent as it last 5-8 hours but only has moderate projection,

Overall rating-7 out of 10 ! Very nice release and it gets points for uniqueness but it’s not a love for me.",03/20/19 02:19,Ryanmmas26

In the drydown, however, I really feel the warmth and creaminess of the musk- that's probably my favourite part about it.

Main notes are: mandarin, bergamot, white florals/jasmine and musk.

The opening is probably the best and most natrual/juicy mandarin openings you can get in a designer category. The great quality you get for the price is unmatchable.

For 200 ml at around 30 $ you get more than what you pay.

CK All Calvin Klein,"One thing is wrong! Citrus notes are not the core backbone of this fragrance — don't be biased by other people voting madarin and lime.

Base notes — Unisex white floral mixed with soap & hand cream feel.

It's a super non-offensive smell, truly unisex. Girls will love to be around a guy wearing this as it's soft and welcoming scent and girls would just nail this smell. It is more on the notes that people relate to feminine scents, but, times are changing — people are coming back to oldschool way of just recognising good smells.

Scent: 7/10 (High quality Unisex scent)
Performace: 6/10 (Not a lot of sillage)
Versatility: 8/10 (Non-offensive)

FYI — If you want a citrus Unisex scent go with CK2 — that's a great choice too.",09/07/18 06:32,arielX
CK All Calvin Klein,"CK All is a nice fragrance from Calvin Klein, especially since he has a huge fragrance line. A lot of people are comparing this to CK One. I have tried CK One and never really been a fan of it. I never understood the appeal of it. This is nowhere near CK One, and I'm thankful because like this one. CK One was just to aromatic and clean smelling, this one has a more citrus floral clean smell. It is more on the feminine side, but guys can pull this off. I think it's more feminine considering CK One was more on the masculine side. This is probably supposed to be the more feminine updated counterpart. CK All starts very citrus and bright. The orange and bergamont blends in nicely while it transitions to the white florals. The dry down is where the bright citrus' and florals tone down and it becomes more warm and masculine smelling. This fragrance lasts for hours and projects decently. A nice summer/spring fragrance.",07/02/18 19:07,Fragrantguy
CK All Calvin Klein,"I bought this for my husband who's a massive fan of CK One. To be completely honest, it doesn't remind me of CK One, it's different, which he immediately liked.

But soon enough, this fragrance has developed into some kind of a dull, lifeless smell. It also has a synthetic smell to it I couldn't ignore once I realized it. I am unsure about whether I am satisfied or not for buying this perfume - the opening is synthetic but just so fun and fizzy, youthful and bright; the rest is like... what?...",04/25/18 11:44,noy815

CK All Calvin Klein,"I have a sample of this. To me, CK All is like the non-identical twin sibling of CK One, which I owned back in the mid 90s. I did wear and love CK One for a brief period, but when I tired of it, I ended up finishing the bottle as a room spray to mask the smell of cigarettes in my bedroom. I was a naughty teenager ;)

Anyways, CK All to me is a blast from the past, which I enjoy smelling for the nostalgia, but wouldn't want to wear today as a woman in her mid thirties. I'm just into other types of scents nowadays.

I also personally find it to be too masculine, and so gave my sample to my husband, who likes it and will no doubt wear it, secretly transporting me back to the 90s every time he does :)",03/01/18 03:11,missviv
CK All Calvin Klein,"This is a clean, fun fragrance. I understand what CK wanted to do. CK One and Be were awesome in their own way for that time, but have lost touch with the younger crowd.
This reminds me of CK one, but with a lot of white musk and less fruity. Refreshing and oddly works also in the winter.
Lasts surprisingly long.
I would have been happy if there was some more depth in the fragrance (added notes of patchouli, menthol etc).",02/19/18 11:58,Little_L

The Rhubarb note in the perfume is so nice and the DNA of CK one exists. An all season, daytime fragrance for the young men and women out there.",02/06/18 00:54,VJG
CK All Calvin Klein,"To me this fragrance opens up very citrusy and strong but that dies down to a beautiful scent. The rhubarb note is unique and done so incredibly well in this fragrance. When you smell this scent it makes you think of the color green, not in that way that it's earthy but in the way that it's fresh and alive. This can be worn all year long, in my opinion. It's at it's best in the summer though. if you like ck one you will love this! it lasts very long for being a fresh scent. silage and longevity are surprising. Starts out bit masculine and gets more feminine as it dries down.",12/31/17 06:42,karienbarsoum
CK All Calvin Klein,"well well well, this is the 1st perfume from CK that I really like it since 90s.... very fresh, soapy and citrus smell.... Good option for the daytime and good perfomance, I got a bottle of 200ml in $52... I think this is a very good price.
A little similar to CKone but absolutely CKall is more citrus and the sillage is better.",12/29/17 06:30,bal026
CK All Calvin Klein,"I know it's dated, but I really, really love Ck One. So I was excited to test Ck All. Longevity and sillage are quite impressive. I easily get 8 hours out of Ck All and from time to time I get a strong whiff of it, e.g. when I move my head.

It is certainly a pleasing scent that will not offend anyone and will even get you some compliments. When I tested it and got home my mom said ""you smell really nice!"". The opening smells like mandarin/orange. I really like this mandarin/orange note. The scent stays quite linear. You will get the orange all the time but mixed with a very strong amber note throughout. It smells like some creamy orange dessert. I love the opening, but the amber is too strong for my liking. I like that Ck All lasts so long, but I prefer the refreshing citrus/green tea feeling with the floral and musky drydown of Ck One.

I think Ck All would be perfect if the drydown wouldn't contain so much amber but would be rather floral/musky, because the mandarin opening is awesome. Maybe it is worth a try to layer Ck All with Ck One?

nice opening of Bergamot, Orange and there is something sweet which is nice about this perfume.

I can smell the Vetiver after 5 hours, So far Its good.

CK All Calvin Klein,"I'm not quite sure why this has so many dislikes.

I'm not a fan of amber, but I barely detect it. What I smell is a rounded, slightly creamy citrus. It's not too sweet, and that's a plus. It's fairly linear. The top notes are present throughout, and never really fade.

As for longevity, this is a 12+ hour fragrance on me, but fragrances in any form usually last a long time on my skin. A woman at work liked it. It is somewhat similar to CK One, but it's stronger. I'm not completely sure about projection, but it seems fine.

It's the type of fragrance I enjoy, clean, fresh, citrus, slightly creamy but not too sweet.",09/26/17 07:40,Housebliss

CK All Calvin Klein,"Very much like CK One with the green notes toned down and amber subbed in to be the star of the show. So you can detect the CK One dna, but it's got a very Sauvage-like vibe going on too. Also firmly unisex.

I think I prefer the scent of original CK One better, it's a bit more refreshing and subtle. Also, I find that as All develops into the skin scent it leans a bit too feminine for my liking.

It's got good performance and I haven't even reached the end of its longevity. I mean, I can smell this on my skin 1 inch away a full day after applying and then its time for my next shower.",08/25/17 18:24,TutorialBoss
CK All Calvin Klein,"got a chance to sample this on paper two times already and, I must say that I disagree with most comments for this fragrance.

The first time I sampled this I immediately liked it. It has a strong yet nice citrus/floral scent that develops into a semi-sweet powdery scent. I guess it was due to the fact that I also got a sample of Eros on that day and must have combined. So I gave it another try. The strong citrus/floral smell was still there and will continue to be there for at least an hour or more. I was waiting for it to settle into a 'warmer sauvage' or aqva amara but it never happened. It was the same citrus/floral scent all throughout. I also disagree that it lasts long. Not sure if I easily got olfactory fatigue or it really had longevity issues.

Overall I still think it's worth a try. Best try it out before buying. I also think it leans more feminine. But whatever, people should wear what they want regardless of what gender the perfume is for :D

CK All Calvin Klein,"CK All instantly transported me back to when I was 12 years old (12 years ago). A guy I was playing tennis with must have been wearing CK One. The Paradisone molecule must be reminding me of Hedione... Definitely a Spring/Summer Daytime scent I don't know who would ever wear this in winter let alone at nighttime. Just before the second stage of the fragrance I caught the smallest touch of ambroxan for only minutes and then, after the musky florals, it became a fruity cocktail with my nose picking up Pear, Apple and even Passionfruit (might be the rhubarb or Grapefruit Blossom though). In the final stages of the scent I am left with musk, in quite naked form, I did pick up on a dirty kind of Vetiver at this point but it has a very short life. Throughout the entire life of CK All the Paradisone and Amber notes make frequent and, at times, intermittent appearances. I would say it lasted around 7 hours on my skin which is amazing in comparison with the new CK lines. For me on the skin it is feminine but the projection/sillage has masculine qualities.",07/10/17 05:58,Slayde

I had a hot tub and put (specially-made-for-tubs) scents in, and there was a copycat scent for CK One which smelled so freaking good in that water. This smells very close to the original with maybe a bit more brightness, heft, and citrus at the top. Love the white bottle. I put it in my husband's drawer, but he doesn't seem to be reaching for it, so I took it back. I will look for it as a lotion and shower gel.

I find that the mandarin in here is very realistic and close to the real fruit (also the main reason I like this fragrance), and then I smell strong amber all the way.

It is a clean orangey somewhat warm fragrance overall, and it can also be quite strong with good lasting power despite being an EDT - I can still smell the scent 5 hours after I sprayed on my arm.

Great stuff.",05/16/17 14:04,JovanMNE
CK All Calvin Klein,"Thank you Klein.
Thank you Coty.
Great one, to fall in love all over again.
It's not so much a flanker as a reimagining and update of One that goes back to basics adding a bit of amber and, I gues, ambroxan to ""modernize"" it.
At first sniff I was transported in time to the very first try of One, which went to be my favorite for a decade or so. It is that similar (and that good) to the original One formulation. A little masterpiece.
The snobs will of course dismiss it as ""generic"" and ""for the masses"" but this is a first and foremost pleasant smell for both the wearer and its surrounding.
Longevity and projection are good to excellent, in line with the first One formulations.",05/16/17 13:58,JovanMNE

CK All Calvin Klein,"I recieved this at work today and I must say - I'm pleasantly surprised!

This fragrance is definitely an amber bomb - it's there from beginning to end - however, mandarin and jasmine also take front row. The opening is a soapy citrus blast, and I immediately thought it would be a carbon copy of CK One Summer (like, one of the eight hundred editions..). However I was happy to find that on my skin, the jasmine and amber pushed forward and harmonised beautifully with the citrus, giving this lovely warm scent. After a few hours I am still catching whiffs of it, and I can definitely smell some grapefruit blossom and maybe some rhubarb?

All in all (heh) I find this scent to be fresh yet warm, light yet noticeable, masculine yet feminine. Yes, you can definitely smell the homage to the classic One, but it's like One grew up and is wearing a knitted sweater in a park in Spring. Fingers crossed this can begin the revival of the Calvin Klein fragrance brand!

Definitely give it a try on your skin, and don't be so quick to judge!",04/28/17 18:45,nx
CK All Calvin Klein,"I much prefer this to the original CK one! - All's heritage is noticeable but I'm loving the mandarin and the amber notes, I always love a combo of warm and fresh notes.
It does seem to have more staying power than One too. Although, as much as I like it I'm going to be staying loyal to my beloved CK one gold & CK2!
To be fair I was only born the year that CK One was released so I wasn't exactly there for the massive hype and I'm sure this can't begin to compare. I would imagine that for a CK One lover this may feel like a poor imitation.

Something else to be aware of, with this new fragrance CK are planning on raising the prices to take the brand up a notch and give more of a luxury feel. So if you wanna stock up on CK One, or Be then I'd do it now as it may become more tricky to find them at great deals soon!",04/28/17 02:33,auSoleil

CK All Calvin Klein,"I agree with La DameDeNoir. A suntheticy underlying note most definitely, bearable; but honestly show me a perfume from Ck line that doesn't have that synthetic feel, even if the notes change. You know what you are going for.Generic as well, but yet again, I cannot imagine a ck line fragrance not being generic and appropriate for all.

It is definitely long lasting and projects well for the first hours when it is more intense. When the scent tames, the projection is softer. Apart from the synthetic aspect, I'm not disappointed by the blend.

Amber does pair well with the citrus and it is very prominent for the first hour. After that it's all white florals with some citrus and less amber. Now the jasmine surprises me; it's supposed to be animalic, but the jasmine is just a little fleshy, just enough for the millenials, it's there, it's there, but you have to try hard to get it.

Warm and crisp at the same time. Alberto Morillas did not fail me even this time; I was expecting a much worse juice of what I got. Above average and appropriate for teens or young adults who want a simple scent with ""that something"" in it.",03/16/17 12:21,iamoir

CK All Calvin Klein,"great citrusy opening for hot climates ...
I wonder who has clicked on winter bar ...?after the Rhubarb stands out...
continue...after more than half an hour citrus fruits are reduced and reaches an explosion of flowers, I feel very freesia on all first ... then comes the power of jasmine and finally comes the lily ... always on a basis of citrus but less strong ... so the scent does not lose its citrusy freshness and don't becomes cloying ... all this after one hour and more...,two hour....this parfum is a bomb...

after more than two hours here vetiver to dampen somewhat the always very strong citrus tones and some moss appears but Amber feels only a timid ombra.la floral part is always present.
I am sure that the votes to individual notes have been given at random. there is no sweetness from amber in this perfume !!!
In conclusion it is a beautiful renovation. compared with ck one, this performance over 12 hours and is more floral than green. very citrusy but a citrus that I like because 'accompanied by flowers from rhubarb and vetiver.
Instead ck be very different from that he had a lot of lavender and musk.
It may be the smell of summer for those who like strong citrus.
I do not find synthetic. Longevity: more than 12 hours. sillage: fills a room and more. for me is unisex. final grade 9/10 and for me it very much because I do not love the citrus.",03/06/17 14:55,lovetribe
CK All Calvin Klein,My only fear with this is hat it pales to the original CKOne that was a citrus powerhouse. And even that has been reformulated to something other than its original edition. I don't see CK capturing audiences with this one. Also CK2 was a stellar tel saw that I enjoy and love and it flopped. It was the perfect fresh inisex scent that was innovative a real departure from the boring releases of today. So here's hoping that this will be a hot and also the are billing this as a pillar fragrance and not a flanker which is kind of hard to do being the branding of the CKOne line is littered with numerous flankers.

As farr as citrus + oriental goes Lord's Jester Helios is in my no. one position but it is patchouli dominant and I HAVE been on an extended amber kick these days, so...I will be hopeful and osmagine the best, but remain guardedly cautious.

CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"This is a good summer scent! The evolution is quite smart: if you spray it on in the afternoon, you'll be refreshed.
By the evening, when the air cools off, you can enjoy the cozy musky dry down, that says: I've been out in the sun the whole day, I've swum, dried up in the sun, I moved and I rested, my body feels completely satisfied and relaxed, now I'm ready for some late night contemplation. It's nice! Not in an oh-my-god-what-the-hell-is-this-spiritual-experience kind of way, but it works very well nonetheless.",04/18/25 14:11,des Garçons
CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"My father gifted me this from his collection in 2013/14 as one of my first perfumes. I used semi-regularly throughout the months of spring and summer. The notes here are all very good and smell like summer from what I remember. I do recall it being weak in terms of sillage and longevity, but at the time just kind of threw it one. So perhaps this is just modern me thinking that, and if I were to smell it again would think different.",04/02/25 09:07,Lime Rivo

CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"I bought this while traveling in the summer of 2013 in a London airport. I smelt it and loved it. It was my first actual ""expensive"" fragrance my parents bought me for my birthday. I loved it so much a few years ago my mom bought me 2 more bottles and I fear I'll have to open my last one soon because I haven't found anything quite like it. It brings up so many memories and goods times! Sorry I can't give more info into the actual scent. It just feels fresh and clean like a tropical spa. I'd love to find a dupe for this!",02/09/25 22:30,Karlieb13
CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,I owned a bottle in 2013. I still vividly know the smell of it. It’s the Giant Granadilla the dominant note in this perfume which is not mention above.

CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"If Hawaiian Punch was to release a fragrance, it would be this. The watermelon, cucumber, citrus and water notes make this smell like something you'd want to pour into a cup and gulp on a hot summer day.

I liked this when I was in my early 20s but not so much now. It smells good - fresh, vibrant and youthful - but in a cartoonish sort of way. At 30, it's just not what I prefer to wear now. Definitely a spring/summer scent.",12/30/22 06:37,McG1993

Anyway, I usually don't care about synthetic smelling stuff, I'm not a top dollar kinda guy, my tastes are too simple. Cucumber melon aquatic? Wow, I should love that. However, there's something about this that just makes me think ""cucumber melon hair spray."" Don't know if that's a thing, but if it is, I bet this smells just like it. It just melts right off my skin in the summer too, barely noticeable in no time.",11/05/17 18:13,DedotatedWham
CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,I just knew I was going to love this. The notes seemed to be everything I typically like. Blind buy. Don't love it. Don't even like it. I credit this fragrance with showing me what too aquatic and synthetic means. I couldn't leave it on long enough to know what the longevity is. This is the first fragrance I rushed to wash off after 30 minutes or so. The bottle is the most gorgeous blue. I wish it had worked for me.,07/02/17 23:36,Jacquelyn1
CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"I love aquatic fragrances, so as soon as I saw the notes on this, I decided to blind-buy it. I'd actually decided not to buy any more CK perfumes because I either don't like them, or they smell too similar.

This is the fourth perfume I've bought in the CK line. I loved CK One until everyone started wearing it. Escape was much too strong for me and I simply can't stand Truth.

I'm so glad this Summer 2013 edition did not disappoint me.

The bottle is beautiful. I love the color blue and the water drops add a lovely element to the bottle. As was the case with One, I like having the option to dab or spray.

This is quite a citrusy scent. With citrus scents, some perform better on my clothes rather than on my skin. This one opens, develops, and dries down beautifully on my skin/pulse points. It's clean, fresh, and inoffensive, as long as you don't use a heavy hand with it.

The longevity wasn't as great as I expected, but then again I used a light hand. That being said, I advise against spraying liberally to make it last. Buy an atomizer and lightly top up your wrists during the day.

Since you wash your hands a few times during the day to include your wrists, you're pretty much washing away the fragrance. Use a fragrance-free (or lightly fragranced)hand lotion then spritz your wrists. The scent will perform at that fresh, sprayed-in-the-morning level.

I don't ever re-spray any other part of my body during the day as changes in body chemistry will change the way the fragrance performs and smells.

Overall, I like it and plan to use it this summer, but I don't see myself re-purchasing it.",06/23/17 22:49,Linda JK
CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"Blind buy here in Atlanta after reading all the reviews. Not disappointed with this one. I love the fragrance and the bottle, but the longevity only seems to be about 4 hours on the skin. This is definitely a layer/mixer fragrance.

CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"First initial wearing : So this is my first wearing of this and so far I must say I'm a little disappointed if I'm to be honest. It does smell ok but compared to other CK One summer scents this 1 is probably my least favorite.

This opens up watery, with semi- sweet fruit notes that are also slightly sour. It is nice and I can see some people enjoying this but this scent didn't really catch my attention like the 2014 and the 2016 version did ( The 2016 version was amazing!!! ) Out of all the CK One Summers this is also the 1 that smelled the most feminine which I didn't really care for. This smelled like a body mist my mom used to wear that I always thought smelled like rotten raspberries. So maybe it was my skin but it almost came off like a synthetic mess but not quite.

Performance on this however is really good so far ! It's been 4 hours and it's still going fairly strong and I can still smell this when I walk. I could see this lasting upwards and into 6-10 hours.

It opens very watery with a hint of citrus, i don't think the citrus notes are very strong. It then dies down with a very masculine watermelon, not a juicy one!

CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"An amazing bottle design, turquoise with the water droplets covering it, just great summer vibe bottle. I didn't really care about the juice just wanted the bottle!

The scent is nice not a stand out frag but a nice light fresh fruity aquatic with a subtle musky dry down, it's no game changer and many will turn away due to the fact its a flanker or slightly generic. But i believe the CK One summer flankers are good and they always seem to change it up each year and are affordable and well done! there's not much too dislike! it's a pleasant unisex scent just to wear casually in the summer heat and it's good for that.

Longevity is poor 3-5 hours max projects well for 1-2 hours but overall a crowd pleaser and a solid summer flanker. Get it 2013 or not 7/10",04/24/14 04:12,SDavis93

CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"The notes listed do not reflect what I sprayed on my wrist to test. It opened with a fresh tart burst of grapefruit.

It bares almost no resemblance to the original CK One fragrance.",08/02/13 17:09,Eos
CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"I enjoy the cucumberishness of this, the suggestion of an aftershave, yet it defies that limitation.

I suspect it will be a mainly summer thing, however.",07/20/13 22:44,lemontreelime12
CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"I'd like to think I didn't find my new favorite scent; it found me. I had wanted to try these limited CK One Summer scents when this year's edition caught my eye in a display at Macy's. It drew me in, to the tester, and from the first spray it had my heart in a way that very few perfumes have. It must have known that it would be right for my body chemistry, because it develops so perfectly and stays on so long. It seems I have had more success with it than a lot of other reviewers, because I never got a hint of that synthetic or musky shampoo vibe that people have been mentioning. For me, it's hours of watermelon and cucumber that don't even really change, they just fade slowly. The citruses are a sweet, slightly feminine citrus, never sour or bitter. It is a little bit sweet but all cool, shimmering and dewy-fresh, as if the hotter the weather the better it will get. Though definitely not for fall nights, I wouldn't even call this a scent that's OK for spring, because it's almost begging for wear in the heat, alongside oceans and cool drinks. I could not get it out of my mind until I went and got two bottles, and I can see myself getting even more so I never have to worry about running out once they stop producing this edition. How lucky I feel to have taken the chance to try THE scent of the summer. I hope others will too.",07/15/13 15:31,Selo12394

CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"This is very synthetic. It smells like a man's deodorant... Not unpleasant, but not what I was hoping for. I had high hopes, but the cheap musk really kills this one for me.",06/19/13 21:03,Kiera79
CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"The review by Michael.J really can't be topped, his is authoritative and comprehensive and needs little more embellishment. Suffice to say Ck One Summer 2013 is a shocking return to form of the classic earlier Summer releases in regards to longevity, which had steadily declined in the late 2000's and peaked with last year's release to an all time brevity that undercut its beautiful top and excellent blending of cucumber and citrus.
Ck One Summer 2013 lasts between 5-8 hours with moderate projection. Unfortunately the scent itself is not as rewarding or organic as last year's. The synthetic waterfall accord extends itself from the initial blast well into the dry down and creates a very generic, watering down of the brighter elements of the blend, leading to a rather linear and insipid development between citrus and fruit to a bland musk and water lily dry down. This is a decent commercial unisex release that exudes fun and youth, but could have been much more enjoyable and effective if the blending would have been more professional and thorough, allowing the watermelon, citrus and cucumber to evolve of the skin without the clouded masking of the entire blend by the cheap, synthetic waterfall accord that ultimately makes CK One Summer 2013 extremely boring after just two or three wearings. More for collectors than those looking for a truly enjoyable, fruity, citric blast for summer.",06/13/13 19:19,dutchschwag
CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"For 2013, the opening watermelon is really intense, and the intermediate dry-down is pretty good, sweet and pleasant. Once the fruit has been licked away, however, the base notes of musk and moss hit the floor with a dull, lifeless thud. They are painfully inert and clumsy compared to the dancing fruit and water notes. Moreover, they smell heavy and slightly rancid, like the interior of an automobile in the summer if you've left some stale jelly doughnuts baking in the sun on the dash for a few days. I've tried this on skin, fabric, paper, other people, and I think it's a combination of cheap synthetics (I have no problem with good synthetics) and inexpert mixing. I think different base notes could have played a more harmonious role (e.g., something more resinous or balsamic. Even the oak moss could stay if the cheap musk were replaced.). I wanted to like this so much because the opening is so seductively juicy, but the fragrance ultimately doesn't deliver on its promise.",06/11/13 08:18,michael.j
CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"This is one of those perfect unisex scents- it really doesn't fall on one gender over the other. That said, it smells exactly like a deodorant or cologne my other half had years ago- we can't place which one, but that aquatic with citrus and cucumber combination triggers our memory of something he had before. It's very fresh, clean and sporty. It has moderate staying power, I spritzed it on before I left the house around 3 and could still kind of smell it on my wrists when we came home around 1 in the morning. It's a great summer smell; I'll definitely use up my tester, but I don't think I'll actually buy a bottle. There's nothing that really stands out to me and screams ""you need me!"" Especially since we know we've had something like this before and weren't attached enough to it to remember what it was. Bottom line: If you're in the market for a trendy summer scent and you really like sporty/aquatic fragrances, go for it. If you're waiting for something special, keep looking.",06/02/13 14:34,Ashes19

If I lived in a hot country I think I would get this, but I don't think rainy UK will do it justice. Would still be a good allround scent for guys I think.

CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"I am quite impressed with this years ck one summer. The bottle design is brilliant, the colour and the water drops are spot on. It is quite a unique summer flanker fragrance and in fact really reminds me of bvlgari aqva. It doesn't really smell the same as it but for me it has that kind of feel to it.

It opens up very refreshing and aquatic citrusy but not in a bitter way. It then proceeds into a more oceanic woodsy water scent which reminds of bvlgari aqva possibly a less mature, less masculine, more synthetic, younger version of bvlgari. The watermelon and cucumber are very dominant here. On me it fades out from here.Although unisex I would say slightly masculine but still unisex.

Lasts for hours 10+, projection is moderate. Pleasant, unique, safe, great value, better than average in all departments must try. Great for summer and plenty of other occassions.

Best bit of advice is dont be fooled by the name it's not just a great summer scent is a great scent period! Reminds me if a happier more jubilant aqua de gio with a little twist. It's more of a cologne than a perfume but the feminine quality of it makes women really love it! If your a female don't buy it ! You will be let down it's way you masculine! If you're older than 30 don't buy it it's too young ! But if your a fun loving guy who wants something just right buy it ... Now!!!,03/11/13 02:24,Tattoosbyaustin
CK One Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"CK One Summer for the year of 2013, is until now, the most ungeneric fragrance for summer I ever smelled. Just the bottle, like my fragrantica brother blacklibran1, makes you want to buy it already, without testing it. I mean, this is really a beautiful bottle, of course, equal to last year's edition, but the torquoise looks much better.

The fragrance itself is really appealing. It opens with aquatic notes but I can already smell the watermelon, which makes this fragrance mouthwatering.
I felt a little of the cucumber in the drydown but I can't fell it no more.
It has been right now 5 hours since I tested it, and I can still smell it. Good for the initical warm days of Summer, ideal for the months os July and Agost.

Deep Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,"I had a strange experience with this– when I first got it, something in the opening notes (i think the lily?) was too sharp for me, it almost had a peppery character. It was a shame, cause I loved how it dried down, but I couldn't stand that opening. I put it in storage with the intention to maybe give it to a friend who would enjoy it and promptly forgot about it lol.
Now, a few months later, I tried it again and I don't experience the same sharpness at all. The florals seems more soapy now. I don't know if it's the perfume that changed, my sense of smell or something with my skin but I kind of love it!
It dries down to a gorgeous, woody scent that could read as more unisex. Will absolutely keep wearing this!",07/30/24 01:49,Claire_Etoile
Deep Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,"It is nice, so refreshing in the opening, a bit floral
But damn, in an hour or so - you'd be left with something masculine
Like a men's deospray with heavy woody base
And it's nothing like Deep Euphoria EDP (completely different smells)
It could've been a good spring-summer scent, but those notes ruined it",02/01/24 05:18,toosimilar
Deep Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,"Almost decluttered this because I haven't reached for it in years. I remember the og Euphoria being a lovely fragrance, but I always felt too young to wear it. I knew I had liked this one better, but it had been so long since I'd sprayed it, I forgot the fragrance.

As I was prepping to list it, I realized that I had put a good sized dent in it. Surely at some point I reached for this often enough. I decided to test it out and my, am I glad I did. My nose has changed a lot since 2017, and I have developed a deep appreciation for chypre and floral aquatics. Deep Euphoria EDT is a beautiful blend of both.

Now, I don't know what current batches are doing, if this is even still in production. My bottle is from the year this scent was released. I know CK is notorious for reformulations that are mere shadows of fragrances that are still warm. I wish they would leave well enough alone. In any case, the bottle I have is not a light fragrance by any means. It is fresh with strength to it. The aquatic quality comes across as deep artic waters, fresh and turbulent. That is softened by the air of water lily and the watery sweetness of fresh pear.

This is followed by a deepening freshness from lush, dewy, and full red rose... green and sweet. Finally peppery driftwood and a touch of salt from a soft and inoffensive musk settle the storm. The bottle doesn't match this scent at all. This should definitely be dark blue instead.

Unique, long lasting, and beautiful, I can not believe I almost let this one go.",01/16/24 09:24,EvaNicoleFragrance
Deep Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,This is so light and pretty. Definitely an aquatic feeling coming through but also that beautiful rose. The pear I think adds to the watery nature because it's such a light and watery fruit. I like this one especially for warm weather. Performance is not great but it is an EDT so it can be forgiven.,02/17/21 21:12,mevans
Deep Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,Something about the EDT in this scent (I haven't tried the EDP) is scratchy and gives me allergies/makes me feel itchy. I think it may be the waterlily which is prominent; I had hoped for more rose in this scent.,07/12/18 04:37,Shoshi

Deep Euphoria Eau de Toilette Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein perfumes are affordable and available and I’m always buying them for gift purposes, but somehow when I have to buy for myself I generally shy away. One reason is because the scents are usually very generic and I don’t find them standing out in a crowd.. Deep Euphoria EDT was one that I truly liked and I would buy for myself once the price goes down a bit. It is light in a beautiful subtle floral way, and not too sweet or strong like the original. I love rose, woods and musk and this one delivers them in just the way I would want to wear.",11/01/17 23:16,Fleur divina

Eternity for Men Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,This is the perfume that made me buy a 3 backup bottles from every perfume that i love because at the time i had it i didn’t know perfumes gets discontinued and i didn’t know this is a season release so when i knew that i’m going to miss this one for ever i learned to buy backups. This is one of the best summer perfumes i had.,08/18/22 12:27,Thevoiceofthesnake
Eternity for Men Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,I really love this. I finished up my first bottle and never had the chance to get another. It is really sweet and I love it so much. It is kind of woody which is the kind of scent I'm into. Woody but sweet but not overly masculine. Probably my favourite to wear at that time,05/18/22 02:49,wanpuppy
Eternity for Men Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"One of the better Eternity Summer releases that I've tried. It's a bit heavier and woodier than most of the rest of this line; the violet leaf and more prominent base notes give it a bit more oomph. Projection isn't very strong, and longevity won't go beyond three or four hours unless it's really hot out, but that's pretty expected for this kind of fragrance. It's best suited for casual daytime use, and like most of the newer Eternity Summers, it's dirt-cheap online so there's very little room for wearer's remorse.",04/27/21 14:52,cheetspeek
Eternity for Men Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"Smells really good, reminds me of a summer in the caribbean. bright and fresh. main notes that you can smell are lime, coconut and sage.",03/19/20 16:47,ERP27
Eternity for Men Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"Whoa this stuff smells good! Very uplifting in the top, the mid is very fresh, and the base is a musk tinged with hay and sandalwood. Smells better than it sounds! If this was bottled at its base as a Musk I'd buy it just for that. I don't get the coconut note, but no matter I'm very happy I picked up a 3.4oz blind at Khols for 37.50. I picked up the female version as well, but honestly for me this is something I would wear or like smelling on my husband so either way I'm happy.",07/05/18 05:58,Mrs. ELE Arjona
Eternity for Men Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"Smells rather natural and pleasant for a ck release IMO

I smell black currant , a tropical feel and an aquatic nuance.

Overall this is very nice for someone new to fragrances for 20 dollars or so. Longevity is 2 hours and projection is poor on me. I am sure the ISO-E super hangs in there for a while longer though.

However, this does smell slightly feminine to me and cannot find myself wearing it.

For the serious or experienced Fragrance lover this is a pass and nothing special.",04/03/18 15:56,scentitar
Eternity for Men Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"An extremely herbal affair, CK Eternity Summer the 2017 edition is very fresh with the violet leaf asserting itself and being given an earthier vibe with the vetiver and sage that I can only describe as coming incredibly close to replicating the smell of clay in the mud quarries I used to visit in art classes on how pottery is made.
The sandalwood and coconut give this a bit of smoky sweetness and despite the negative reviews here, I find this somewhat original and more of a risk taking venture than usual for these seasonal CK releases. 4-6 hours has been the norm in warm weather for me and moderate sillage the first 1-2 hours before becoming soft and more subtle.
Not a remarkably attractive scent, but different and unusual and deserves your consideration for at least a test in the department store. It won't appeal to everyone because the violet leaf does clash a bit with the sage in the heart for more sensitive noses and the bergamot quickly gives way after the top and allows the violet leaf and vetiver to dominate.",08/18/17 11:02,LiarinChief

It was so different on my skin, its been about 3 hours and i can still smell it, and I really enjoy this, its kind of musky and citrusy on my skin.",05/21/17 15:40,tkhan6

Eternity for Men Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"Well, I had given up hope that Calvin Klein would ever have another great smelling fragrance. Sure, some of them have been okay. But it has literally been decades since they have had a scent that I really got into. This is surprising since year after year another flanker is released from CK, and every year I yawn.
Except this year. I sampled this one today and I will be going back to buy it. I love this one. At first it comes off migraine inducing synthetic but give it a few minutes. I know that sage is listed as a top note but I think it comes out more with the sandlewood after it settles. The sage becomes much more apparent once it settles but man, I love it. I thought it was just okay until I wore it for a while, but it dawned on me after a few hours. No chance of this one getting nauseating. I have to say though, as much as i love this one, it's like an exaggerated version of being stuck in the 90's, but in a good way. Sort of like if Patrick Nagel created artwork in the 90's. It's like you've stepped in a time machine and you know you've gone back but you can't pin point which decade you're in.

Eternity for Men Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"Tried this new release at the macy's counter... light, enjoyable summer offering but very similar to ck2 (which I already own and love). The coconut is not overly sweet here. Not bad at all, but due to light performance in regards to both longevity (about 3-4 hrs on my skin) and projection, I would recommend staying with ck2, which is already available at discounted prices.",02/21/17 16:13,RobKY
Eternity for Men Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"Because this is a summer release you can bet that the most prominent notes are probably going to be coconut nectar, bergamot, ginger, and maybe the violet leaf. I'd be knocked over with a pin if the vetiver, jasmine, and musk actually came through. Regardless, I'll give it a sniff when it comes out. Calvin Klein's recent summer releases, since 2014, have been better than the years prior.",01/31/17 06:52,invaderlark
Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"At the opening, you can really smell the pepper strongly, but always with the sweetness of the coconut. The only thing is that at first you can feel more of the freshness from the lavender, and then as it dries down, it smells of coconut — but very softly, it’s not a deep scent.

The longevity is rather poor. I put it on my hand at 5 p.m., and by 10:30 it was barely noticeable, even close to the skin. By 1 a.m., it was practically gone. It lasted me about 3 hours.

The scent is nice, but it fades away really fast. I can justify the purchase if you really like the smell or if you can carry it with you to reapply every 3–4 hours when you’re out for a while. Or if you just want it for a dinner or a short outing. But even then, I’d always recommend carrying a travel-size version to reapply when the scent fades.",11/12/25 07:35,Simba33

Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"After a few months of owning and wearing this perfume, I have to say, my opinion has gone down. Don't get me wrong, this perfume is very good, but considering the pricing, maybe you would be better off going with one of the JPG Le Beau fragrances if you are looking for this type of scent. The opening is very juniper heavy, makes me sneeze every time, and after comes a very sweet coconut. Although it smells nice, I didn't see myself reaching for this on hotter summer days as it very much does get cloying and doesn't even last that long in the heat for me.",10/03/25 07:01,Duccman

Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"Does not smell like Le labo which is leather and sandalwood and some green papyrus.... the notes are not even similar at all. This is definitely overload of coconut, lavender, juniper and cardamom.... I simply don't see how anyone thinks this smells like santal 33, the only note they have in common is cardamom. And I can tell you that they smell completely different not even similar at all, santal 33 doesn't even have any sweetness in it where as this is very very sweet in all the ways I personally enjoy but may be too sweet for some people. Luckily because this is so sweet the aromatics actually gave it a good balance and the lavender helps cut through that sweetness.

I absolutely love OG Eternity, but this has absolutely nothing to do with it. This is just awful. I'm surprised with the ratings.

Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"Edit: I don't know why, but suddenly occured to me to try this on one arm and bad boy cobalt elixir on the other...
Cobalt elixir is smoother and less sweet in the opening, which I prefer. That said, they are very similar and if you have one, you don't need the other. If you have none, this is a great summer evening fragrance, but I definitely prefer cobalt elixir. It's smoother, less rough in the opening (less intense/sweet coconut), and in a side by side comparison, it seems of much higher quality. That said, this is a cheaper, nearly as good alternative to the same DNA and well worth it.

I've had this for a while and like others, the first few times I wore it, a saccharin sweet, almost sickly base was hard to grit through. A few months later and it's summer and oh man... The overly sweet facets have mellowed and there's more woods and lavender in the opening and dry down. This is now a killer summer fragrance. I don't know if my nose changed or this thing actually macerated, but if you felt like this had potential if not for the headache inducing sweetness, give it a few weeks or a couple of months and try again. Maybe it's just me, but the last few times I wore this, I was completely taken back by how good it is and how little it resembles what I remember it originally smelling like.

Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"It smells nice, let me start with that. As an aquatic scent lover, I tended to avoid sweet perfumes, so Eternity brings something new to my collection. That coconut is just insanely strong, and not in a bad way.
However, this was the first perfume out of maybe 100 that I tested, that made me suffocate and really irritated my respiratory tract, especially when being sprayed on the chest-neck area. Therefore I cannot call this an easy perfume to wear. I'd rather just smell it on someone else and let them deal with the breathing part.
I am however still considering it.
Later edit: bought it.
Even later edit: Pro tip: don't spray it on your chest or the front of the neck, unless you want to suffocate. Also I walked in a shop wearing this, got dates with both sales ladies.",05/29/25 02:20,cypriant

Not as sweet as JPG, and not so animalic (or I dont know how to say) as Issey Fusion Extreme wich is both good.

Coconut, juniper berries and lavender are the main notes I get. I expected a bit more woody smell, but it is OK, thankfully its not so very sweet. I am waiting for the Summer (and Spring) to wear because its fresher than to wear it now in -1C°. Sillage and longevity is still under testing.",01/22/25 08:42,josephcoconut

Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"I honestly can't believe how good this is for the price. This fragrance is slept on by everyone. It has a beautiful creamy coconut note that's not overpowering and never comes off as being synthetic. Its exceptionally well blended with all the notes working in harmony together and the dry down is wonderful. It puts my boss pacific in the shade.
I blind bought a 200ml bottle for 80 bucks and have zero regrets. In fact I might just by another while it's on sale as I live in the tropics and this may just be my new signature given no one knows about it.
Longevity is perhaps 6 hours,but with a 200ml bottle, just reapply as you please. A solid 8/10 for the fragrance and surely a 10 for value. Possibly the best fragrance CK has ever made.",12/31/24 18:47,WhoFarted?

Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"After reading some of the reviews here I had high hopes on a blind buy ahead of a tropical island getaway.

At first I was a little disappointed but on the dry down it really comes alive. This is my first fragrance with a coconut note and I genuinely love it. Not too sweet and doesn't smell synthetic or like BO in my opinion. The juniper berries definitely stand out after the first couple of hours but the coconut also lingers.

Received two compliments my first day/night wearing it, with one of the waitresses now wanting to buy it for her partner.",09/25/24 23:18,pluralist
Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"Creamy coconut with a bit of backbone from the juniper berries, pepper and cardamom. A perfect mix of sweet and fresh.

If this was in the JPG Le Beau line folks would be purring about this one but in al honesty it's even better than them because it never once comes across as synthetic.

9/10 if you like creamy sweet fragrances this is a no-brainer and performance is great as well.",09/07/24 22:05,jjames799
Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"Updating my review. I have used this a good 10+ times by now. So this is a dark green velvet creamy coconut fragrance. But in a not so thick way. It is definitely a coconut forward fragrance and surprisingly keeps that note throughout. To me it's light pine , coconut husk, coconut oil , slight creamy. I don't really get the pepper or much lemon. Slight lavender. It leans more aromatic than sweet which I do like . It's not a youthful fragrance in my opinion. It's more for a 30+ man . I liked it more and more . But I can totally see why some people wouldn't like it. Performance is great. I was able to smell it on me for about 4 hours. So I was probably projecting for a good 5 or 6. It was on the skin for a good 8. I was able to smell it on my clothes the next morning. If you want coconut but not too sweet I suggest giving this a try",09/04/24 13:19,WildCalifornia

Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"Love this. Bought because I really like the opening and mid of JPG Paradise Garden but can't stand the cloying drydown. The opening on this is not as speactacular as Paradise Garden, but very nice, fresh and bright, the mid is very similar to JPG PG and the dry down , for me, is way better , as I dislike the drydown in Paradise when all the best notes have disappeared.
CK Eternity for Men Aromatic Essence is a great summer fragrance, but I expect I'll wear it any season. It's fairly linear, but a great fresh, yet warm, sexy, smell. It's the only CK I own as I don't like the smell of CK 1 , Eternity etc . This one is something special if you like coconut and green vibes.",08/04/24 09:52,StevieM
Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"I've had this a couple of months now and I'm a fan. I'm wearing it this evening and have stumbled upon the realisation this is like a lighter, fresher, summer flanker of PDM Layton. And I'm glad to see I spotted at least one other comparison in the reviews. Obvious comparisons to the Le Beau line but I'm not so sure now. Of course the coconut is there with a good bit of sweetness but this has a cleaner, more easy going profile and is much less synthetic.

There are crossovers with Invictus Victory Elixir but thankfully CK doesn't dry down with the same playdough vibes. I owned both Le Beau Le Parfum and IVE and went on to sell them because of the aspects I didn't like or tired of quickly. I felt that CK gave me the best parts of both, removed the negatives, and added its own thing. Now I've got to know this one better and picked out the Layton-esque vibes, I'll be wearing this one a lot more. It performs pretty well on me too and I'm more than happy to overspray it without risking overdoing it due to the nature of the scent. This hasn't been hyped other than being called a hidden gem, so I'd really recommend trying it out.",07/23/24 11:16,olfactsnolies

Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"I'm a bit flabbergasted with this one, honestly. I went in store to get something and the lady there (whom I'm now on second-person basis with) told me they got the new Eternity in and I'm not a big CK fan so I was a little indifferent and she said ""it's a better version of JPG's Le Beau!"" and as a big JPG fan I obviously dismissed that statement... until I got a sniff. This is stellar!

It does open with Le Beau EDT's coconut note but without the pineapple from the EDP this is much less sweet, much creamier while the juniper brings freshness and lightness as opposed to Le Beau's much sweeter, heavier DNA. I don't smell pepper here to be honest. The drydown is where things are very different to my nose. Whereas Le Beau is very linear and stays very sweet, Aromatic Essence dries down woodier, drier and smooths out, taking it closer into fougere territory with gourmandish inclines from the creamy coconut. I honestly have a hard time believing what I'm smelling here. CK often don't disclose their perfumers but this was obviously done by a very skilled perfumer. Perhaps Frank Voelkl who did the Parfum not long ago? Let me make this clear: this doesn't reinvent the wheel. It's a familiar DNA but refined and more mature. Even though I'm not the type that's after compliments, this obviously will be a compliment monster.

It's got good longevity on me (a good 6-7 hours, probably more in the heat) and thanks to that woodier drydown it probably won't be as crazy sweet and overpowering with warmer weather. This is perfect for spring, probably will be for summer as well (although not on stupid hot humid days) and is very office safe if sprayed sparingly. After the disappointing Reflections which left me completely cold, Aromatic Essence is very surprising outing from CK and will be getting a lot of use in the coming weeks.",04/27/24 09:36,sorvaahr

Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"Dammn, I'm so in love with this fragrance. Yes, it's not revolutionary but it's sure unique in its own way. A fan of coconuty fragrances and this here is top-notch, one of the best if not the best coconuty fragrance in my collection. I actually prefer this to my Le Beau le parfum, which is on the edge of too sweet & juvenile for me (though not a deal breaker). This is just a sweet, creamy, more mature coconuty concoction in a bottle.

The performance on my skin is great (10-12 hrs). The projection is loud for like 2-4 hrs, 6ft-10ft, definite room filler (choked a colleague out who was seated in an opposite room, doors open with 5 sprays). It still does projects even after 8 hrs because I've recieved comments from 2 different colleagues, on 2 different days, both said they could smell me walking down the stairs from the 1st floor while they were on the ground floor (at the end of an 8 hr shift), that's insane. Could still smell this on my wrist even after 20hrs.

All in all, really happy that I was able to get a 3.4 oz/100 ml tester bottle for $43 & at that price, it's a steal. It punches way above what you'd expect from am eternity flanker.

Smell - 8/10 (not unique but smells awesome)
Longevity - 8.5/10 (for a CK 10/10)
Projection - 8.5/10
Sillage - 8.5/10
Versatility - Spring, Summer, Autumn 8/10

Surprisingly pleasant, carries a ton of detail. I perceive it too sweet to be decisively masculine, rather unisex, and something a bit juvenile about it as well. Yet, it's great.

Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"This stuff has no right being this good. Surely not, it's an Eternity flanker, right? Holy moly, this was a full-bottle immediately. Destroys my Le Beau frags (too sweet), makes Boss bottled Pacific whimper with fear (too weak). Zanzibar is running for the hills (too...something), as well as any other 'coconutty' or tropical fragrance I have in my collection. Why? They have managed to somehow wrap those aforementioned things into this fragrance, whilst adding an aromatic/green/herbal nuance to it in the drydown that is awesome. I don't care what the name on the bottle is, this stuff is getting a lot of wear this spring and summer. A lot. This, for me, personally, is one of the best releases I've smelled this year. So far, on my skin, both longevity and sillage/projection are moderate to strong. Paradise garden is good, but it didn't 'wow' me like this one has. Just my opinion, YMMV",04/05/24 11:24,Felixthreeone
Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"A very surprising fragrance in the Eternity line. It definitely doesn't smell like any other Eternity flanker nor like the original. It starts off sweet, a fresh baked cake kind of sweetness. But it's not a dense or heavy type of sweetness, more of a fresh chocolate with some musk (but nothing like Axe Dark Temtpation, don't worry). This part reminds me of Bad Boy Extreme which gives a very similar gourmand style scent sensation. As the scent develops the sweetness stays but is acompanied by more fresh notes in the backgroud.
It smells really good and extremely wearable. Best release from Calvin Klein in years for me. I can't separate the coconut note but I'm sure it could be a part of what I describe as ""cake"".
It's definitely worth a try. The only bad thing about it is the price, which is pretty high for a CK scent but from my experience CK scents tend to drop in price quite fast so it's probably better to wait a bit if you like it.
PS: not similar to Bvlgari Black at all, there is none of that burnt rubber or dark vanilla smell.",04/04/24 03:51,Candyandy

Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"As I've written somewhere else, I find these three new releases to be cousins, CK Eternity Aromatic Essence, JPG Le Beau Paradise Garden, and CH Bad Boy Cobalt Elixir. They scratch a similar itch. Compared side by side, CK is the least sweet of the three, especially in the drydown where the other two sweeten up, but, though I usually gravitate towards sweeter scents, this one appeals to me the most. It's a blast of coconut in the opening that's more satisfying than the one in JPG, little less aquatic than that one, too. It's still slightly sweetened coconut water, but it's a bit thicker compared to JPG. Gradually, it turns into a pleasant, mainly aromatic scent, with a bit of sharp woods.

Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"Fresh, light, clean and minty.

Opens sweet, fresh, cool. (Only a touch aromatic in the beggining, so the name feels apt.)
Feels modern. Has an airy, minty aspect.
Has some citrus (grapefruit?)
Then sweetness, possibly from honey. Smells a bit like peppermints.
Overall it's a light fragrance.
Becomes creamier with vanilla alongside a clean musk.
Has some vetiver in the base (could be juniper?) and these spiky notes do become a bit ""vinagery"" off of my skin after a few hours.
Smells a lot nicer in the air than directly off the skin.

Suits men more than women. Guys aged 25+. All seasons, daytime best though.

Performance is ok; good projection first hour and a half(ish.) Longevity as a skin scent is 6-8hrs.

I don't think it's that close to the original, reminds me more of ""Reflections."" And also reminds me of ""Mont Blanc Explorer: Platinum,"" in the far drydown.

Misleading notes IMO. Didn't get loads of coconut until I saw it listed. Thought I could smell it then but that could be the power of suggestion?

Eternity Aromatic Essence for Men Calvin Klein,"MisterD, it is indeed the new Eternity annual, or summer, release. It feels like they are stepping away from the ""Summer"" moniker for both Eternity and CK One for the past couple of years, as they have nearly 20 years of ""Summers"" with nothing to set them apart other than the release year and bottle design.

Eternity seems to update the classic to what the modern take would be while staying true to the DNA, which you can see in the juniper and lavender with the very trendy coconut in this year's blend. Looking forward to getting my nose on it, but not going to pay the full $150 asking retail when last year's ""Reflections"" can already be grabbed for $50.

My guess is that they are doing away with the ""Summer"" theme for their yearly releases entirely, so it can sell year round

Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"Leathery dates in a vanilla-benzoin syrup, with some sticky floral sap in there too. Very sweet, very rich. Smells like a Middle Eastern dessert. It's longevity is impressive. I can still smell it hours later and my skin tends to eat fragrance up. This isn't really my cup of tea ... anyone want to swap a travel-size spray decant for this one?",06/25/22 12:43,Catalina Marie
Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"If Lanvin Me and Salvatore Ferragamo Signorina Misteriosa are battling it out for dominance, it would be CK Euphoria Pure Gold. I love how the smoky accord here which the leather and dates create is so similar to the blueberry - licorice accord of Lanvin Me. This is just a tad sweeter due to dates are naturally sweet compared to the fresh bluberry of the latter. This smells exactly like floral agarbatti (incense sticks). I find no challenge wearing this since I love strong and incensy perfumes like Yves Saint Laurent Opium and Dior Poison.

I am wearing it in the high summer heat and it is just divine.",05/13/22 22:38,GhostFleur
Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"This is a very unexpected deviation from CK’s Euphoria and a rare instance where CK successfully goes off the beaten path. Pure Gold keeps the Euphoria DNA but gives off a completely different vibe. It also leans more unisex than the original. Frankly, I am just now realizing how many flankers of the Euphoria line there are. I almost mistakenly left this review on one of the other gold flankers, and I wonder how closely Pure Gold aligns with the notes in those. I have the Amber Gold flanker, which I do NOT care for, but smelling them together I can tell they most have some key things in common.

I really like Pure Gold's dry, sharp, linear leather note, and how it contrasts with its delicate, fruity sweetness. I cannot identify the actual fruity notes here except that they are light and not overwhelming. In addition to the fruit, there is a soft and well-blended undercurrent of almond, vanilla, and orange blossom running throughout the life of the fragrance. I cannot smell the patchouli or gardenia listed in the notes.

I was surprised to read how many people hate its opening – I loved it at first spray. My least favorite part of it would be the dry down, where for several hours the leather is the most prominent smell. I like it, but because it is so sharp it can be overwhelming and veering into sour territory, which I guess is what keeps others from embracing it past that first spray. It was anything that would prevent me from wearing it regularly, that long leather heart might be it. At the end the leather just leaves completely and I must say the sweet fruit is very refreshing as it bursts on the scene quite abruptly in the end.

I am on the fence about whether I love or like this fragrance but I think I am in love and I am upset I did not try this earlier. I am already planning to buy a second bottle for backup, and I can’t see myself not always having a bottle on my vanity at this price point, which is literally a quarter or even 1/16th of the price of some of my other fragrances. Pure Gold smells way more expensive than it is. But it's just another good old, affordable Calvin Klein staple and what’s not to love about that?

Calvin Klein keeps most of its fragrances in production, but I can see fans of the OG Euphoria being really turned off by this abberation. Therefore i would not be surprised if this is the first to go if and when CK decides to pare down the Euphoria flankers and I need to do some doomsday prepping for that!",02/26/22 17:41,chyan
Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"i'm a pretty big fan of the euphoria fragrances, but this one is sickening & nasty smelling. i've never hated a perfume upon first sniff until now. i tried giving this fragrance several chances after a blind buy but i decided it would just be best to return it, i'm not a fan. i feel that the leather and benzoin is most prominent in this perfume and that's my problem with it- this fragrance is akin to a randomized concoction of notes that are not at all complimentary or flattering. yuuuck!",12/31/21 17:38,niurkav
Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"I had so much expectations about this perfume, but it is just horrible! Blind buy based by reviews and notes that looks attractive. In reality Pure Gold is just a combination of notes that do not exist in harmony with each other. It starts with sour green accord that has weird nauseous undertone, then evolves into benzoin bomb with almond and red hot iron note (similar to those you can feel in Liquid Gold) and finally ends with sticky dirty cheap amber-benzoin base. Lasts forever. Impossible to wash away. Do not blind buy!
And by the way it has nothing in common with Euphoria Gold that I really love!",12/30/21 21:51,neonaya
Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"This is absolutely divine! I can smell a tiny bit of oud as I spray, maybe it is the benzoin, then comes this dry sweetness of the dates - and it lasts until the scent dies. The dates are the stronger note on my skin, projection is strong but this is not sharp in any way (like the original, IMO). Its a very rounded perfume, unisex and delicious. I couldn`t smell any leather, unfortunately. Longevity is amazing. Highly recommended!",12/07/21 15:40,AL8
Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"Meh. Not better or even as good as the original. It's a very warm, deep amber scent. I also detect a bit of a honey note even though it's not listed. I normally like amber but I think the leather combo is not right for me. There's a bit of furniture polish smell that I just can't ignore. It's also a bit too masculine for my taste.

Later - had to scrub it off. The dry down turned into Lysol.",12/02/21 05:55,KaliDurga
Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"There was a fragrance by Oriflame called M Marcel Marongiu. It was released about a decade ago and is sadly discontinued. It was a beautiful incense and dates smell mixed with roses and balsams. I missed it so so dearly. Ahhh what happiness it is to discover Pure Gold! It reminds me of M Marcel so much just without as much incense. It is so lovely, oriental, sweet and leathery. A worthy blind buy!",11/01/21 09:40,bel.gravia
Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"Edit: I don't smell that strong of an oud note anymore! Maybe my nose played tricks on me! I still believe it's there, but more subtle than I initially thought. I get that this is not for everyone, but you certainly need to give it some time, it might actually grow into a love ;) I've received compliments wearing it! My original review under:

Nice! Pure Gold smells like a fruity floral OUD.

It certainly does open with bright and floral accords, in addition to that fruity sweetness. But it is like it rests on a rose oud that gets stronger by the minute and that ends up dominating the heart of Pure Gold (thankfully the rose is not very dominant). So far from what I expected! That missing oud note explains everything in the comments though, from burning tires to how it can be a challenging and very middle eastern perfume!

What I love the most is the ylang. The wafts you get of this gorgeous yellow flower after a while is beautiful and what makes the scent special imho. It creates a polarity where you get this strong, almost pungent accord and at the same time these lovely feminine flowers that hover on top of it. Fascinating effect, because what you smell up close and from afar is quite different. Actually, Pure Gold reminds me very much of Fidelis from Histoires de Parfums, but it's more floral and feminine, not as warm and spicy. Still very similar for a good part of the ride, but I might prefer PG because it is easier to wear - owning both is a little redundant, but who cares when they are both such beautiful creations!

I only get a little bit of almond, but it is a great addition when it does peak through! Drydown is lovely with more emphasis on warmer notes of soft leather, benzoin and vanilla. I have no doubt believing that this smells heavenly when it lingers on a scarf or a piece of clothing! Yum

Absolutely great and unique find! Recommended 👍",09/29/21 12:24,zind
Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"Instant love with this one! Dates and leather, freshened up by solar note. Not overly sweet, unique, powdery, and elegant. SPL are just perfect.",08/07/21 00:47,dualaokto
Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"IMO...CK Pure Gold for Men and this are for sure....""related"".
I layer them together for great results.
Pure Gold for women...IMO....has a sweet leathery vibe....and yes,dates. I guess the ""solar"" notes are the new version of aldehydes...????
I do get the neroli, ylang ...orange blossom and almond-ish notes in this as well. But those notes are ""blended"" in with the others...and patch/musk for balance on the bottom.
This performs better than the men's version on my skin. It is brighter/sweeter and ""punchier"".
Although not remarkable....and there are other current scents that follow this vibe,I do enjoy this scent so far.",05/03/21 14:18,mapache
Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"Wow, this perfume is intense! Definitely unexpected. I'm not entirely sure if that is in a good or bad way. I don't know what to make of it and I will need to probably wear it a few times with some rests in between, but this review is for my initial thoughts.
I was picking out what scent I wanted to wear from some Euphoria flankers (amber gold, gold, pure gold) by sniffing the atomizer. Pure Gold stood out to me as it smelled a bit sweet and pleasant. Today is a chilly spring day so I wanted something comforting and cozy. I quickly spritzed the inside of each elbow and 2-3 spritzes on the front of my blouse.
I immediately had instant regrets. ""Cripes! What have I done?!?!"" It was SO extremely masculine. The leather and benzoin was quite strong. I felt like I was stuck with this man scent, but my heart kept whispering, ""Give it a chance. Wait for the dry down."" So, I went to busy myself with other tasks to take my mind off that I smelled like my husband.
(Which I will note that the opening does smell like it would be fantastic on my husband. It smells great, but is not what I care to smell like. I prefer more fruity/gourmands, but I am open to trying new things.)
Now that it's been an hour, this scent has calmed down quite a bit. Sometimes that leather comes up strong and hits me in the face and other times, it's rounded out by soft florals and a sweetness from the patchouli. Every now and then I whiff of something that sends a thrill up my spine and makes my chest leap in a fantastic way.

I'm reading reviews saying that it's very Middle Eastern which makes sense. This does smell strange to my very ""western"" nose. It is a beautiful fragrance. I'm just not sure it's *me*. Hats off to CK for making something more out-of-the-box, complex, and different than their usual. Sad to see it's discontinued, but that explains why I got such a cheap price.
While I blind-bought this, I would definitely say it is not a good blind-buy if you like more sweeter, mass-produced perfumes. I don't think others around me would appreciate this scent. I could definitely see some people finding this offensive. I will probably wear this a few times at home before I gather up enough courage to wear this out (likely to the market during these pandemic times).
I look forward to getting to know this fragrance better. I'm glad I stepped out of my comfort zone today.
I'm not going to vote on it, yet, as I still don't know what to make of it.",04/22/21 07:25,RubyRedCancer
Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"Saw a video by Mona Kattan recommending this and I took the plunge. It’s is very middle eastern! I had never owned a perfume this potent and at first I doubted myself. Gave it time to grow on me and now I can’t imagine life without it. This opens up almost immediately leathery or maybe it’s the benzoin (something Smokey apologies I don’t have a trained nose), it’s sweet from the dates in a modest amount, a little nutty from the almond and a walloping indistinguishable jammy bouquet of sweet flowers. All the notes in the base are heavy hitters and this fragrance punched me right in the nostrils on the first spray 😂 what converted me though was accidentally spraying this in my closet where I keep my perfumes. The minute I walked back into my room, I smelt it for what people within my radius would experience. STUNNING. INTOXICATING. The type of fragrance that stops you in your track. Silage and performance is a 10/10. An extreme hard hitter from CK of all houses who would have guessed! It’s a grower, but I have never had more compliments from any perfume. Keeper. Underrated gem. Also I don’t think it’s a good beginner oud frag because it’s potent and coupled with patchouli, benzoin, musk, leather (I know like WOW so much going on) but it’s gorgeous in the air. But if you’re confident, this ones a beauty.

Ps. Also to those who say it smells like burnt tires, I literally smelt that the other day (it was horrendous) and this perfume smells nothing like that 😂 Smokey yes, tires NO.",01/26/21 05:56,dearaari
Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"This is a great find for me. It was pure coincidence that I should have found this, yet I somehow did! Match-made-in-heaven!

Stunning perfume.

Smells very similar to the now-discontinued Mac Ruby Woo - the same leather, the same development. Another favorite of mine. Simply gorgeous.

It's a crime both of these perfumes have been discontinued. This prominent leather note found in both makes these decidedly gender-ambiguous in the drydown, but the sparkling nature of both makes them still come across as feminine and opulent.

Pure Gold opens with an initial burst of strong sweetness, but that phase surprisingly disappears fairly quickly. Beautifully sensual. I wish perfumes like this were more popular with the mass-market.

This sort of leather infused compositions have truly become my ultimate favorite of late.",05/26/20 11:11,pasha
Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"Pure Gold has a strong vibe of leather and powder that reminds me a bit of a Shalimar flanker. Then it adds an unexpected sweet note with the dates and a wallop of solar.

Admittedly, this isn't an easy fragrance to love immediately. It starts weird. I can completely understand this as a release designed for a specific market where scents are bolder, bigger, and stronger. The notes are a bit discordant at some points, and it can be a bit too much - too much solar, too leathery, too sweet, too weird. This is _not_ one to blind buy.

Updated to add:

After I tested this, I tossed the bottle in a drawer and forgot about it. A few days later, a friend stopped by, and I loaned her a wrap because she was cold. When she returned the wrap, she insisted on knowing what perfume was on that scarf and where she could buy it. I sniffed it and couldn't recognize it. What was this gorgeous scent? We spent the next thirty minutes spraying bottles trying to find it. Finally, I remembered that I'd worn that when I tested Euphoria Liquid Gold, and that was the scent.

While I'm not a massive fan of the top notes, the dry down is a sweet, natural date and some Shalimar-esque leather and powder. It's beautiful in the bottom notes, and it lasts forever.",01/31/20 09:58,_christine_

It took me so long to update this!!! Being stuck inside during coronavirus, I’ve finally found time !
So this was NOTHING like what I expected (Opium YSL/ Shalimar Vibes)🥃💥👑👸🏻

It was confusing because instead of smelling leather notes, it confused my Nose to smell ‘Smokey, almost a tobacco opening..
So how does this smell on its own? Strong, for a evening where you want to be ”THE WOMEN” (1-3 sprays is more then enough) in the room like no other women, will stand out !!
This is for an ALPHA female in a gorgeous evening gown either white or black
Winter for sure, there is no other season this will suit.
If you want to smell like “ bitch mode” class or “ “unique” Smokey heavy Date bitter almond this is the one for your collection I wish there was a little sweeter I sometime feel layering it with viva la juicy gold can change it into a more seductive scent but not a cozy cuddle me fragrance

Independant women mode 9.1/10

Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"I have a soft spot for Calvin Klein fragrance, so every time there is a new flanker I have to get it. Unfortunately, I couldn´t get a sample, so I decided to blind buy this frag and it was a huge mistake. It turns my stomach. :-( I can´t even identify the notes in it, all I can smell is burning rubber and benzoin. Maybe there is some neroli somewhere far away. The notes were so promising but the reality is just horrible. I will give myself few more days and try it again. If it doesn´t work, it has to go. Anyone near the Czech Republic who is brave enough to adopt it?",01/09/18 09:25,Martina Chlupackova
Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"...I've finally come to the conclusion that I enjoy this fragrance very much! It's kind of like a bad first impression, but then finding out that even though we are different, there's much to be enjoyed with the personality of this fragrance. It is now a really fragrant orange blossom and vanilla musk on me, with a brightness that ends up making me happy. This is NOT my usual style of fragrance, so I'm pretty surprised, especially considering the beginning, which I thought was pretty loud, heavy and screechy, but now, not at all. I don't know why now, I'm appreciating this fragrance so much? I think this is a wonderful change for my usual fall/winter wardrobe. This is heavy enough to suit me, but in a completely different way. I don't know if it's the neroli or the ""solar"" accord that tips the scales on this, but it is not my usual dark, serious fall type. Even though it is still pretty thick in composition, it somehow still keeps a playful happy accord to it. I like it, I really like it. :-)",11/02/17 06:47,tsth
Pure Gold Euphoria Women Calvin Klein,"I got to test this at an airport and despite not being listed in the notes my first impression was of a strong oud over rich vanilla. I thought it worked well in the composition though, being very luxurious. It settles down to a be rather thick and heavy scent, similar to other recent releases but unique enough to tweak my interest. I'd say it had good longevity just based on the fact that the scent has stayed on the tester card for over a week.",08/19/17 04:35,Awater01

Eternity Rose Blush Calvin Klein,"Category: Floral, fruity, slightly aquatic

Notes: Sprays on super fruity, I’d describe it as a sweet grapefruit that quickly intermingles with a very fresh and distinct rose. Within 20 minutes a slightly powdery undertone emerges, I’d say likely from the amber. A bit of spice from the freesia as well. The scent remains floral-heavy throughout and is never overpowered by its base notes.

Vibe: Koi pond and water lilies. Rose petals. Luscious curls. Freshly showered. Fresh spring rain. Monet paintings. Phoenix. Pink and green. Visit to the florists. Wedding day bouquet. Goldfish aquarium. Gazebo. Romance.

Sillage: 5/10. Decent sillage, definitely noticeable when you get up close but not offensive and stronger than a skin scent. In my opinion this is the perfect kind of sillage.

Longevity: 5/10. So far it has lasted me about 3 hours. I’ll add an update later.

Wear: Day or night, all year round. A really beautiful everyday scent.

Overall rating: 6.5/10. This perfume is that fresh-out-the-shower scent wrapped up in a bottle. That might just be a fancier way to say it smells kinda like shampoo actually. It’s floral and fruity, and incredibly feminine. There’s a slight powderiness that appears after it’s been worn for a while that I personally don’t appreciate but it’s not at all overpowering the scent, more of an annoying background noise. This is a lovely perfume, just not for me. If I had to describe this fragrance with one word it would be romantic.

Who would wear it?: Angelina Jolie (current, not during her sleaze-era) or Ingrid Bergman maybe.",09/28/24 16:58,JaneBond

Eternity Rose Blush Calvin Klein,"It's the 'Shirley Temple' effect: take a little ginger ale and infuse with a touch of grenadine. Plop a cherry on top. Keeps the kids happy; lets mom and dad swill their grown-up drinks in peace. 'Eternity' has not left the building -- it's still the most prominent aroma in Rose Blush. I get the feeling that there was less of a blending of fruit and flowers into the original than a handsome dollop of them over the whole composition. It's not bad like that. I do miss the swoop of heliotrope in the original, but welcome the fruit and the extra sandalwood in RB.

In the end, harmless, sweet and diverting. Feel free to wear it whilst crammed onto a commuter jet, holding onto the straps of a loaded subway, or leaning over the cubicle of the most allergic girl in the office. CK Rose Blush speaks no evil.

Whenever anyone trashes CK frags I suggest giving this a try. This stuff competes with ALL the heavy hitters and smashes most of them IMO.

Obsessed for men EDT was OK but honestly quite forgettable to me, this EDP is a totally different beast, a totally under the radar gem that needs to be experienced to be believed. Maybe CK/Coty should re-release this stuff as a standalone scent with the name CK Mystery, keeping the sleek black bottle or maybe giving it a mirrored effect as with Obsession Night.

I don't know anything that smells similar to this (many say Black Afghano though I've never smelled it) but perhaps imagine a combination of CK Encounter and with a touch of L'Homme Lacoste Intense and hint of Azzaro Amber Fever (edit also a little like Euphoria for men Intense, this is way stronger though). Performance is extremely good too, very long-lasting and it creates a beautifully mysterious and compelling sillage. High quality gem from CK.",01/04/22 12:58,Dark Owl
Obsessed for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"@Giskela you have commented on here no less than three times complaining about people thinking this smells like BA. clearly it does, and many people agree. why does it bother you so much? get over it.",09/27/21 11:39,neinmuses
Obsessed for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"One spray at the time, or the guiac wood will hit you in the head. For me, this was a steal. You can never go really wrong with Calvin Klein, and ""eau de parfum intense"" sounds like value for money. But does it smell nice? I was looking for an Amber-Woody successor to my Halston Amber (Amber + Oud) and this one does a marvellous trick. It's a beast for sure, and absolutely NSFW. I sometimes use it as a base layer for Burberry London for men, they are both Guiac Woody, and the tobacco in Burberry London enhances your presence, if that's what you want. Fot those who didn't know, guiac wood is also called palo santo, and some energy workers burn this wood before a session.",09/07/21 17:45,Suburban Gurban

Obsessed for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"People who say this smells like Black Afgano should have their head examined (please don't kill me I'm only joking so take no offense) this to me smells like hair shampoo and it's ok but for a younger crowd for clubbing and similar occasions.

Obsessed for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Short and sweet review! CK Obsessed Intense is a real good smelling fragrance and it surprised me how really nice this scent is. The Projection & Longevity are excellent (but no beast) which is surprising for a CK scent. Most of them(I have around 30) are at the average mark but Obsessed Intense does go further. Not massively but enough to notice a difference.

I really do love this fragrance but I have to go easy on it because it's not that cheap and I heard it has been discontinued but not sure about that. . Three squirts is more than enough to get you noticed! All in all a 8.5 out of 10 for me👌👍😍🍻!",04/30/21 06:34,johnjubal1958
Obsessed for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"since adding Black Afgano to my collection and doing a side by side comparison, I must say the two are strikingly similar. it's that sweet, plastic, playdoh note they manage to create while not sharing any notes.

CK opens up much brighter due to the rhubarb and grapefruit, and stays that way for maybe half an hour. soon after, the cashmeran and guaiac wood peak through, and this is where the likeness to BA begins.

with low prices (despite discontinuation) and great performance for a CK, I think I would choose this over BA. it's more wearable and mass appealing.",10/01/20 09:55,neinmuses
Obsessed for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"This is my initial impression of CK obssesed intense.
The sparkling grapefruit oppening instantly remind me of issey miyake noir argent, but then after 2-3 min latter, they both went into different direction. In noir argent, the insense became more prominent. on the otherside,Obssesed intense went into slighty sweet and balsamic scent. The gurjan balsam smells very similiar to succan absolute notes in Davidoff amber blend.
I think this is more polished and wearable version of davidoff amberblend, i seldom used amber blend because it way to loud, and dont mixed well with high heat.

I will put this more often in my rotation to see how it develop in my skin.",08/05/20 06:47,Spinning@backick
Obsessed for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Yes, this is really similiar to something... I came to conclusion that it is really similiar to 1 Million Prive by Paco Rabanne but more soapy.",06/06/20 02:54,Lamark
Obsessed for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I just don't understand how some people say that this smells similar to Gucci Intense Oud and Black Afgano Nasomatto. I had Gucci 2016 batch and I had a decant of Black Afgano and I have an official sample of Ck and there is absolutely no connection with Gucci and Black Afgano. It is ok scent a bit feminine, reminds me of shampoo but it is not even in the same ballpark with Gucci and Black Afgano, not even on the same planet.",05/30/20 05:30,Giskela

Obsessed for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I've owned a bottle of this for a good while now, since late spring/early summer last year. More extensive 'review' to come but honestly this is one heck of a mysterious (and exceptional) release. Calvin Klein knocked it out of the park with this, extremely high quality, a smash hit waiting to happen yet they don't market it???????

The world (and so the Calvin Klein brand's marketing!) is strange, this is a masterpiece in comparison to most designer releases in the last 10 years. A must buy!

If this does one day get some Youtube hype I can safely say that for a change, the hype would be real.

Dang, maybe I should've kept this a secret?",02/12/20 01:50,TrephineArtist
Obsessed for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Much like the post before me, this smells REALLY similar to another frag and I am going nuts sniffing bottles here... The opening is like a slightly more gourmand version of Man in Black, but it might just be the pepper giving me that vibe. Encre Noire comes to mind as well, but with less of a piercing cashmere note, and more on something sweeter like the grapefruit/rhubarb/vanilla combination. Or as someone else said, I can agree with, it even makes me think of La Nuit D'Issey. La Nuit is ""darker"" and spicier, but this scent DOES have evocations of La Nuit. The dry down is quite woody, and pleasantly smooth. The notes mix quite well, do not seem to fight one another, and I am a fan of this frag overall. It does not have any ""chemical"" smells to the composition, so that is a plus in my book. I love when a blind purchase turns out good!",01/25/20 17:20,Riftwind
Obsessed for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I recently picked this one up in a New year sale.
For me it's a fresh and spicy scent. Very pleasant and wearable but nothing ground breaking or unique, in fact it reminds me of something else I can't quite put my finger on.
Would work well as an office scent or as casual wear.

Longevity is excellent I get 7 to 8 hours easily.
It opens with the grapefruit and rhubarb which fades quickly and then it's pretty much a spicy, woody affair.

Clean, fresh and spicy and overall a very nice fragrance with great lasting power but nothing new or innovative, in my opinion.
Nice one to have in the collection as a simple scent to reach for when you just want to smell pleasant.",01/03/20 06:51,Ticktock

Obsessed for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Finally I found this at a duty free shop in Ireland, I was beginning to wonder if it even existed. Why is this stuff so hard to find??? Mystery to me.

This was just a quick test but Obsessed Intense for me is completely different to the regular EDT version in the clear bottle, to my nose they don't have a lot in common at all. This however is a truly lovely, refined and sumptuous fragrance from CK. Such frag snob s will snigger at that statement and this next one- the house of Calvin Klein continue to surprise me with decent releases (CK one shock for men, Obsession night for men, CK2, CK Obsessed) that soon it will no longer be a surprise but an expectation once again.

Definitely a smooth and dark spicy/oriental gem of a scent this one.",04/17/19 14:11,TrephineArtist

Obsessed for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I found a great deal so I bought a bottle. The ""dark"" fruit at first is nice as well as strong, but doesn't last long. Then it's rather weak, but the blend is pleasant. I can't think of anything it smells a lot like, but at least it doesn't seem too ""chemical."" There's a touch of sweetness and obviously some mild musk. And it's not ""lavender overload"" country. I used two sprays so I'm surprised others think it's strong. Next time I'll use more sprays and report back.

UPDATE: After a couple hours, it started to ""bloom"" and was at its best. The far drydown is similar to Derby Club House Ascot.",03/18/19 16:02,Bigsly
Obsessed for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I picked Obsessed Edp up blind after reading all the favorable reviews. Sadly I'm not too impressed by it. I was expecting an exotic incense scent but it is just another fruity, sweet, spicy nighttime scent.

It seems to have good lasting power but it doesn't project much on me.",02/25/19 01:00,Oldspice

Obsessed for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"Start out as a creamy fruit based scent and evolves into a powdery synthetic woodsy all too familiar generic fragrance, it showed promise until the dry down stage, the scent lingers on for about 4 hours then goes into a close encounter skin scent, overall O.K. for night time events .",07/18/18 14:15,jozemo

Obsessed for Men Intense Calvin Klein,"I never cease to be amazed by CK and their steady output. Even more surprising is just how many I really like among them. This stuff is nothing short of superb, evoking some very notable scents along the way. The opening is a tart, fruity note, not immediately recognisable as rhubarb but settling to it after a moment. This just frames the scent as the main body is one of deep woods and resin, but fruity evoking a little of CdG Floriental. You can really get the smell of guaic wood and cypriol softened in the drydown by vanilla and amber. Obsessed Intense is a very dense leathery oriental in the style of Carner cuirs, Palo Santo or Nasomatto Pardon but slightly cleaner, cheaper and more mainstream. It's hard to pin this stuff down, I think there were several other fragrances it reminded me of, all of which were niche, which I think speaks for itself and tells you where this is going. I want it. I thought it was excellent, kinda messy and all over the place but more thought provoking than most releases I've tried lately.",04/25/18 05:54,Houdini4

There’s a definite warmth to this and something “Tom ford” about it but it sits so close to the skin and has terrible performance. I wish this was more challenging or interesting.

Opens with a warm-spicy burst of cinnamon & fruity-florals, that deepens into a floral heart of black-orchid with near-violet, creamy, sweet, fruity & warm-spicy tones, resting on a sandalwood base with trace patchouli. Overall what I get is the original Euphoria Calvin Klein, with a thin additional layer of cinnamon-sandalwood. It's as if the listed fantasy note of 'black orchid' is code for the original Euphoria Calvin Klein. The longer it's on the skin, the more the cinnamon-sandalwood combo comes out. Personally, I would have liked the original Euphoria to be dialed back even further in this composition, but I'm still enjoying it. Enjoy!",05/16/23 11:43,suzanne_ronald

I thought it was another scent and sprayed liberally according to the other scent's low projection and wow-zuh! Do. Not. Over spray CKLGE! Do. Not.

It was too much because I overdosed. After it settled it was a beautiful quite masculine sandalwood fragrance. A man could EASILY wear this and he would smell fabulous in it!

As for me I will try another day and not over apply by accident. Sandalwood lovers should try this one!

Dec. 2021 - I've been wearing this now in the coolest weather and I really love it. I found an inexpensive body cream with sandalwood (Bodycology S'mores something) and it pairs nicely with this CKE version. I love the lingering scent of this perfume on my sweater.
I still hold to what I said that it is unisex and in fact has a masculine edge to it. In my experience my last few wearings don't seem as strong. I think that is because now it is winter and I am used to wearing my heavier perfumes, so CKLGE doesn't come across so strong to my nose.
I do think all the different names of these flankers get a bit confusing but that seems to be the naming trend we are in currently.

Liquid Gold Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Edit:
When I first tried it, I detested it so bad, I found it super masculine, plus I am not fond of cinnamon neither sandalwood, and I usually find both of these notes “especially cinnamon” are well used in men’s perfumery!! But, as my relationship becomes stronger with perfumes in general, I hold it back again to retest it before saying bye bye to the bottle, and I was surprised when my impression was “mmm this is nice”, and I couldn’t understand why I didn’t give it a second chance!!
Back to the scent: first the Calvin Klein's DNA is clearly recognizable, 100% unisex, leans more to the masculine side, somehow sweet, super spicy, BOLD & sexy, perfect for winter, it’s definitely on the heavy side, not the easiest to pick up.
Longevity and sillage: very very good.

Tag Her has a prominent note of Orchid at the heart of it. Liquid Gold plays on the Sandalwood. So yes, they are quite different, especially in the beginning. Liquid Gold has a very distinct woodsy feel. The Tag has a creamier feel to it, with the sandalwood playing a supporting role, instead of the lead.

Both are EXCELLENT scents and I am happy to have acquired both of them. I actually purchased three of the Liquid Gold.",07/28/16 05:30,hagertygal

Liquid Gold was a limited edition and was on the expensive side. If you missed out, you can feel confident buying the Tag.....for about half the cost. The Tag has a vanilla note in it, but it is not very noticeable, it just gives it a smoother, rounder feel than the Liquid Gold has.

The whole combination has a dirty vibe which make it sexy in a special way,I don't mean dirty in it's negative meaning,I mean something alive,hot and powerful

Liquid Gold Euphoria Calvin Klein,"It's a beautiful scent. I can't believe it includes only 3 notes! I really like wearing this scent, but I must admit its lasting power and sillage is not as strong as I expected. I wish it had a bit stronger sillage and a bit longer staying power.
It's a 4/5 perfume for me. :)",10/30/15 05:04,Hejjdy
Liquid Gold Euphoria Calvin Klein,"This scent is powerful, sensual and demands attention with the elegance of gold and commanding power of a leather whip!

This perfume does seem to have a sensual sweet hint of honey and fruit yet I see none on the list of notes above.

Liquid Gold is not to be abused! One spritz on the wrist will conquer a closed area within seconds!!

Liquid Gold Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I am so disappointed as this perfume is not working for me at all.i travel to Dubai every 3 months,so I get to purchase many perfumes that are not available elsewhere.my mother-in-law asked me to get it for her,so I bought one for myself as well and the male version for my husband.while I really like the male version on my hubby,the female one does something nasty on my skin,turning musky within a very short period of time and leaving me with a feeling that I have to shower immediately to get that scent off me.what a shame!this has never happened to me before,my chemistry usually goes with everything.not liking this perfume doesn't have anything to do with the fact that I don't like middle eastern scent,there are many that I love and that go well with my skin....never ever has wearing a certain scent made me feel dirty and funky before...gotta give it away,hope some of friends like it,otherwise this was a waste of money",04/08/15 08:08,MaryMaryQuiteContrary
Liquid Gold Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Didn't like this one. I have to echo the reviewer below who said it smelled like a man's cologne. I think it's the oud note in it that's throwing me off.. something about it just struck me as way too masculine and although it's sweet, it's not sweet in a feminine way. I know oud isn't in the listed notes, but I definitely detect a really cheap synthetic oud in there, and it gives the scent a plasticy band-aid quality. It's actually a little sickening. This might just be my chemistry or nose though, I seem to have trouble with heavily oud dominated fragrances.

A big thanks to pravda48 who was generous and kind enough to gift me with a sample after my bottle didn't arrive (it did eventually come, but I had to return it due to a broken sprayer). I really appreciated the chance to find out if this was for me or not. FYI, the bottle is very cheap looking and flimsy compared to the original Euphoria bottle. The metal part of mine was literally falling off..",04/01/15 23:15,Alayna1011
Liquid Gold Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Received my bottle today, new, sealed, never used. Blah! I like cinnamon smelling perfumes but I do not like this one. It smells like something a man would wear.

Liquid Gold Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I was gifted euphoria liquid gold on my birthday recently. I'm not a huge fan of ck fragrances, especially his euphoria line ,so was kind of reluctant to try it. But curiosity got the best of me and I sprayed my hand with the smallest of squirts,and OH MY GOD!!!! it was magical. I was instantly transported to the land of flying carpets and spice markets. Spicy yet sensual. I looked at the notes here on fragrantica and was surprised to see just three. Cinnamon, orchid and sandalwood. But then this is what the magic of blending notes in perfumery Is all about.
Opens with a huge blast of woody cinnamon. Not the sweet bakery scent kind, but real cinnamon, raw and woody. There is a note somewhere in it which is kind of familiar to ck's contradiction perfume, but I can't yet place my finger on it. The sandalwood makes it creamy and smooth. I'm not sure how an orchid smells like so can't vouch for that. I do get faint hints of oud but it's not written in the official notes.
I'm hopelessly in love. its available widely in the Middle East. I'm thinking, if shehrzad of 101 Arabian nights wore a perfume, this would be it.Divine!",02/10/15 03:17,fragaholic79

Liquid Gold Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Such a wonderful fragrance, so rich and warm.

The cinnamon and sandalwood steer fragrance throughout, with the classic euphoria orchid note quickly appearing at the beginning, this also has incredible lasting power, 10hr + on my skin.

I've been enjoying wearing this in the recent hot weather, but I also think it will be a fantastic fragrance to wear in the autumn and winter due to its heavy character.

One of my favourite launches from this year so far - 5/5",06/21/14 11:40,BirmanDolman
Liquid Gold Euphoria Calvin Klein,"3 (main) notes only and everyone is in love with this fragrance???
I adore CK and have a lot from his collection...

I saw this perfume in Germany at the duty free. Seems rare, havent seen it in Africa where i live.

It does smell nice, warm and sensual...i never bought it as it was pricey tho, as usual with his frags.
I just wasnt aware that there are so few notes, it smells way more complex.

Reminded me of (Black XS L'Aphrodisiaque) with out the cocoa .. and I agree I can smell the Oud here (so I can understand why it's in middle east only)..

deep spicy oriental scent - very good lasting power and sillage - reasonable for cold weather ..

update: I bought it yesterday, this could be so easily unisex ..
not feminine but still charming and has some hints of the original.

One more thing .. when I sprayed this on my mom wrist to try it immediately she said "" there is cinnamon here ? '' !",04/28/14 01:47,RoRoSe

Downtown Calvin Klein,"The opening made me think candles, craft stores, then potpourri. Surprisingly harsh opening, without the fruit notes I was expecting. Creamy gardenia takes over the middle, which is unfortunate because I have finally realized I dislike gardenia. All the notes appeal to me except incense and gardenia, so it's a shame it doesn't come across as more fruity. I'm relieved I got a sample instead of a bottle, because I am not a fan.",08/29/25 06:00,lilsuccubus
Downtown Calvin Klein,"It was a very light, pear, and citrus fragrance. In my opinion the ads did not reflect the fragrance at all. Rooney Mara seems like a serious, attention grabbing gal, so she wouldn't wear something this inoffensive. I remember the launch at the fragrance store I worked at being uneventful, this did not sell well.

I also disliked the cap. The cap was ""hollow"", so it didn't cover the spray nozzle that much. Discontinued but you can find better, more long lasting fragrances anywhere to be honest.",07/23/25 06:30,theperfumemaniac
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Sparkly and slightly skin scent that is discounted. I have half a bottle left still, and I either wear it on its own or sometimes combine it with red fruity fragrances like si passione or tresor midnight rose. I don't think it's like all the other skin scents, there is something different about it, can be sort of edgy, and that is why I am upset I cannot find it anymore.",04/07/25 05:21,whimsicalgirl

Downtown Calvin Klein,"This perfume is one of my absolute favourites. It really makes me nostalgic though that might just be because I wore it as a teenager. But I think the smell itself is nostalgic, it starts off light and floral, once it settles into your skin it ends on a more comforting, almost sensual note. I've always received compliments from my partners on this one! Wish it hadn't discontinued.",12/10/24 18:18,lolataylor
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I wish this perfume worked as well for everyone else as it did for me, unfortunately it just didn't.

Downtown Calvin Klein,"I can smell pear, plum, and white flowers.
I can find hints of citrus and a bit of incense and maybe musk.

It's a slightly sharp scent that becomes powdery when you sniff too closely.

I have always preferred to have VS Bare Vanilla on top to soften the scent and take off some of the edge.

In general, it's not a perfume I would ever reach for.
But since I once received it and it sits and takes up space on the shelf, I use it occasionally.
I have no idea if it has been discontinued. I have never smelled it on anyone else other than myself.
So I'm probably not the only one who doesn't feel like it's a winner.

It's not bad, but really not a scent you would rave about.
It's the scent you can't remember.
It's the scent you don't need.

There are so many other options in the same vein that I think would work better as a perfume if you're into these notes.

I'm normally a vanilla girl. I could never imagine myself buying something similar.
It reminds me a bit of Tocca Simone.
And I don't like that one either... Unfortunately.",02/28/24 12:21,Cecilie.l.s.m
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I love this pretty fragrance and found out today that it's one that I can safely wear and not have to worry about it bothering my asthma. The performance is not stellar but at the inexpensive price point reapplication isn't a big deal.

Edited to add that it was under $20USD when I bought mine and it was worth that much (but I would never pay more than that due to the abysmal performance, though it DOES last much longer if you also apply to hair and textiles).

6/4/2025 update: my 100ml bottle is still nearly full. Now that I'm finally getting over long-term illness and my senses are improving, my opinion of CK Downtown is more favorable, but - again - I just can't with the prices they'll charge for the discontinued ones like this.",02/20/24 08:37,Abby Normal

Downtown Calvin Klein,I feel insane because for years I’ve scoured the internet and see nobody talking about how it smells exactly like a Hollister circa 2015. Ever since i got this perfume in my teens I’ve thought that. Not sure if they still sell this one but if you have a teenage daughter who doesn’t like any perfume bc of headaches this one might work. The scent might be dated tho.,10/04/23 10:28,Migraine excellence
Downtown Calvin Klein,"i had this years ago, when it first came out. it was on sale at the airport and i loved it so much back then, i asked everyone to bring me a bottle when they went travelling. i still have some left but i don't use it because i don't want it to run out :( i miss it so much, couldn't find anything similar to it. it's easy to like, you can use it daily. makes you smell clean and fresh. i felt so sexy with it.",09/24/23 16:50,idilarins
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I adore this perfume. It is such a sublime balance of accords. Aquatic, woody, aromatic, fruity, citrus, sweet, crisp, juicy, fresh, cucumber, ozone, blue, rain, and air. It is refreshing, cohesive, and wonderful.

I am sniffing it as I write this interview… As I smell it and close my eyes.. it invokes the feeling of being at an airport for the first time… looking out those massive glass windows at the air planes with excitement and butterflies in your stomach. That visceral, curious feeling of being in such a welcoming, fun, modern, grand, airy, exciting transitional place… It smells like flying, traveling, or cooling breeze! It evokes childlike whimsy and excitement in me.

This fragrance is fresh, aquatic, and crisp yet also sweet and fruity. It’s feminine and lovely. It is not as sweet as some other mainstream feminine perfumes tend to be, because it is also crisp, aromatic, woodsy, and it has that cool aquatic smell (which I adore). I would not describe this fragrance as basic like others have, I have not found a fragrance that does it for me quite like Downtown by Calvin Klein does. Maybe I’m just lucky in how it reacts with my body chemistry, because it also smells phenomenal on my skin. The dry down has such a hauntingly beautiful woody dimension; it smells like an enchanted dewy forest with ripe crystal fruits growing on the trees. It's so delicious and beautiful. You need to understand that this perfume drives me absolutely crazy, like it tethers me to past life or something. It feels so good and so familiar to smell it that it hurts. It's nostalgia and reminiscence in a bottle.

It’s one of those perfumes that’s such a treat to wear because it smells delightful and satisfying, whether it is freshly applied or whether it has had time to dry down and settle on your skin. Wow. I love this perfume with my heart and soul. It’s as if it was created specifically to cater to my tastes, my personality, and my whimsy. It is everything I could ever ask for in a perfume and more. Sad to hear how many here don’t like it, or even outright hate it. I must say that I do not understand, but it’s fascinating how vastly our tastes can differ. More for me >:))))))))))))))))))

I hope you enjoy this fragrance even a fraction as much as I do if you decide to try it out. It’s such a treat.",01/31/23 17:14,sillyfruit
Downtown Calvin Klein,I had a bottle of this before. I tried it and didn't like it. Something was putting me off. Through this perfume I found out I don't like perfumes with pink pepper notes.,09/19/22 00:32,J-An5
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Downtown is a very light, airy, soft fragrance. It's pretty linear and all I can smell is the lemon/bergamot mixed with some soft floral note. The perfume also has this bit of a salty quality to it. I guess that's the aquatic/ozonic accord.

It is a fresh, pleasant fragrance and I like it a lot but the longevity and sillage are terrible. It stays close to the skin right from the beginning and I think you'd need to respray every one or two hours since the longevity is poor.

It'd make a really nice perfume for hot summer days since it's quite refreshing.",07/22/22 11:53,Caladhiel
Downtown Calvin Klein,"You know when you go to duty free and spray every single perfume tester you can see? Then after about five sprays of different perfume they all smell the same?

Downtown Calvin Klein,I used to be so in love with this scent. But I just can’t ware one scent season after season and year after year. It came and went and it was time to move on but it’s a nice spicy fruity floral. Very nice scent.,06/03/22 16:55,soniamcalear
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I’ve loved this fragrance for years but in all honesty, this scent has a personality of a wallflower. Doesn’t stand out in any way, not offensive at all but has a nice common feminine scent. Doesn’t really have any sillage and doesn’t make an impression. Very forgettable. But once you get to know it, you like it. It’s a very safe no-brainer pick for running errands.

I love this and I’m going on my 3rd bottle and will always keep one in my collection but I would never give it as a gift. I’m sure my girls would pick a BBW spray over this.",11/19/21 13:11,DanaLorayne
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Not bad, but also not special, non offensive for sure, light.",08/19/21 12:57,Sunshine_jaybird
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I dont understand why this perfume is so unpopular. I personally really really like it. To me, the pink pepper smell is the strongest which I think adds a lovely bit of spice and uniqueness to an otherwise floral fruity feminine fragrance. At the first hit you think it's ordinary until you get to the middle not which is prominently pink pepper. Unlike other feminine fragrances, I think this one has an intrigue to it with each layer giving off a different type of scent. I really liked it and just don't understand why people don't like it as much.",07/05/21 11:47,Tajwer Shamsi
Downtown Calvin Klein,wtf...just throw the whole fragrance away. Smell like wet pencil shavings.,04/20/21 10:56,poppyetpear
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I can see why people dislike this one, but also how it is kinda likable. For me, it's a good one for everyday, office, running errands...but it's just that. Better than nothing kind of smell. Still in love with CK fragrances, just this one didn't wow me.",03/13/21 03:20,Chira
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Blind bought it. I don't dislike it, but don't like it either... just, there's absolutely nothing that stands out about this fragrance. It smells pretty generic, like a fruity/floral shower gel. On me, it lasts only 3-4hours and becomes a skin scent quite quickly.

Bottom line: it's just a generic, faint fruit scent. Chances are when you wear it, no one but you can smell it. Not recommended if you're looking for something a little bit more special or out there.",02/17/21 09:30,LeAx
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Blind buy at Walgreen’s at a super duper clearance price. Keep an eye out for those, seriously, I believe it was 90% off. It is a nice quality fragrance, but nothing to write home about. Perfectly pleasant, but that’s about it. I do wear it, periodically. Mostly when I have little desire or expectation for silage or longevity. If you love it, I hope I have not offended you. If you are unfamiliar and undecided and see it a good price, go for it.",02/11/21 21:45,phunstuph
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I purchased this for £9.99 for 30mls in Savers as a blind buy. I sort of liked it at first, but then I found that the pink pepper in it was just too overwhelming and strong and I came to really dislike it. I tried to use it up, but only managed about a quarter of the bottle and finally admitted to myself that it really wasn't for me and I got rid of it.

It lasts a decent amount of time on me...around 6 hours...why is it that the perfumes I like the least seem to last the longest on me???

On the few times I wore this fragrance to work I did receive compliments from my colleagues, so other people do seem to like it, it's just not for me unfortunately.",02/05/21 12:11,princessbee
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Same vibe to me as Moschino Toy2 (brighter apple; Downtown is muskier pear) - light, inoffensive, pleasant perfumes but not particularly unique. Like a nice shampoo. And that's okay! Sometimes you want a ""dumb reach""/safe perfume.

Longevity is a few hours, and sillage is on the lower end of medium. CK missed the mark for having this be the beginnings of a line ""even more popular than Euphoria"" but it stands fine as a pleasant solo release.",01/01/21 08:50,fyetan
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Big disappointment. Smells generic, like some kind of watered-down fruit juice. Longevity and projection are poor.",09/26/20 09:58,sugaryrose
Downtown Calvin Klein,"The magnolia in this immediately reminded me of Guerlain Champs-Elysees EDT (which I know is mimosa, not magnolia, but these share a definite and undeniable olfactory vibe). Then there's the prominent pink pepper note which is similar to the pink pepper in Jason Wu's first, eponymous release. The pear marries well with the magnolia to provide a sheer sweetness. The rest of the notes seem to create a harmonious base with fleeting appearances made by the plum-violet leaf-musk combination. Very pretty if not the most original.
Performance is mediocre, reapplication is pretty much a must after a few hours, but this isn't an expensive fragrance so other than for convenience's sake this doesn't bother me. In fact, sometimes it's nice as I like to change fragrances throughout the day; that said, this one is nice to start and/or end a day with.
The scent, though not innovative, IS very pretty. CK Downtown is delicately inoffensive and should work for wearing to church, any business, or other places where you'll be around groups of other people.
I found mine online for a song and cannot complain about the minuscule price tag.
Overall? I'd say this one merits a good, solid 6 out of ten.
Sillage and projection are soft; longevity not so good; the scent itself is quite lovely. Again, not ground-breaking but very nice IF you know that you like sweet, light, inoffensive, pretty fragrances among the variety.",03/01/20 04:11,Abby Normal

Downtown Calvin Klein,"This was another super inexpensive blind buy and I really like it!

Not sure why it has had so many negative reviews. I suspect it was victim to poor marketing and timing, being released rather out-of-trend.

Downtown is just a lovely, understated fragrance. I think this is a perfect summer scent for work or going places that you don't want to smell overwhelmingly scented.

This has a nice soft gardenia and the wood notes are just enough to make it interesting. I would wear this to a casual daytime wedding or to a birthday luncheon and it would not offend. This fragrance fits the same category for me that scents like Acqua di Gio femme, Benandre, Nocturnes do. Some occasions call for a more muted fragrance.

I find this has decent longevity and I could still smell it on myself after the day's end.

Downtown Calvin Klein,I have tried this over and over trying to smell something and could never make head or tail of it. This weekend I finally could smell it. It honestly reminds me of DKNY pure just not as green and FCUK night because it is just a synthetic vanilla a plastic vanilla just as though they threw it together for the sake of it to release something I have smelled better hair conditioners than this and it wasn't cheap when I purchased it. It is 1 of the most boring smells I have ever encountered. No spillage no projection or lasting power and no note progression just boring.,05/26/19 19:49,scentsational taste
Downtown Calvin Klein,"It smells fresh and elegant. But it doesn’t have a distinctive smell, almost ordinary but really nice low-key. I maybe use this for a spring-summer go to smell.

Peppery at the start, then moving into juicy fruit notes, then creamy floral and a soft vanilla-musk drydown. It stays pretty close to the skin, almost giving the impression of a beautiful fancy lotion. It reminded me slightly of 212 Sexy, but it's not as sweet as that one. Downtown is a rather nice cozy scent and I believe it suffers from the fate of the smell not matching up with the name, packaging or advertising. I would buy another bottle though, it is a great fragrance for when you're just being relaxed and casual.",08/06/18 08:19,stacia79
Downtown Calvin Klein,"This reminded me of a high end cosmetic smell, like a face or hand cream before my nose got used to it. Must be the creamy gardenia. Mellow, has a bright opening, fruity sweetened and aqueous, a little like being at a creek with some flowers and a campfire nearby.
The opposite of downtown. I think we are decidedly out of town and escaped to nature here. It is relaxing to me, not a loud perfume, just a wear anywhere, naturally pleasing scent to uplift your day. I love perfumes that are natural smelling and don’t whack you in the face. Very inviting! Long lasting especially in the sweet-warm musk drydown which is really nice.",07/29/18 11:02,Erinbath22
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Very faint, can't almost smell anything. Sweetish, musky. Stays Close to skin.",07/11/18 08:52,Cathped
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I blind bought this in a sale and I'm definitely glad I took the chance, despite the negative reviews here. It's fizzy and fruity in the top notes - lovely and sweet without being gourmand, bright and fresh in the opening. This made me smile at the end of a long day - it has a cheerful effect. There is something of Hermes Twilly about the way it fizzes, though this is fruity sherbet boiled sweets and not ginger. I love this uplifting effect.

There is more to it than the fizzy top - as it dries down it gets richer and I feel the musk, woods and incense coming out, cutting through the sweet fruitiness. Quite gentle woods - a good wisp of incense, enough to give it some edge.

It is light, but not invisible for me as some reviews have suggested. It's very much there, but not shouting, which is exactly what I wanted for the summer. Something to delight, something sweet and lovely, something easy and fresh. I have many perfumes with big, attention-seeking personalities - sometimes I just want to smell good, and I can imagine I will be reaching for this a LOT.

Edit: Think the song 'Downtown' by Petula Clark, not sweaty, sexy clubs down town and you're pretty much there.",06/12/18 14:26,NixNox
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I couldnt agree with the comment below me more!

I dont get this.

I dont understand what this perfume is trying to say.

Its pretty much a scent of puberty that has an identity crisis. Like the girl in the picture. PRECISELY!

LOST!

Is it fresh, is it creamy....is it innocent,is it sexy?

Mid development is all about fruity florals with dominant gardenia and with a nice touch of a bit romantic and warm pink pepper.
This all leads into a woody and musky base with a wisper of incense and the floral notes recede into the background.
Downtown is a soft,positive and pleasant scent.However,if you prefer strong fragrances,this is not for you.

Longevity - 6/10(5-6 hours)

Weather -best in early autumn,spring and summer.
Age - 18+
Compliments - 7/10
Scent - 6,5/10

Main notes according to me -
pear,gardenia,pink pepper,lemon,violet leaf,plum,musk.

The drydown is soft,woody and musky and I get some -cedar,flowers,incense and musk.

Emotions -positive,pleasant,comfort,relax,casual.

Occasion -For more or less any ocasion,perfect for casual activities,college and office.

If you like fruity floral fragrances,Downtown is a safe choice for everyday wear.",05/03/18 10:30,Ivanus
Downtown Calvin Klein,Does no one detect a salty note and a relation to Reveal and Womanity?,01/27/18 09:08,vugelke
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Although it's a pretty scent, I just never seemed to reach for this one out of my collection so I sold it off after trying to love or like it more for a good 6 months. The notes are quite accurate (I'm primarily a citrus lover, it being the top note, I had high hopes) however nothing specific stands out, it's almost as though they blend together so much so that they become lost within one another...unfortunately turning it into a fairly generic, almost bland/boring perfume (imo). As said, it is pretty and I can see why others would like it, it is inoffensive but overly safe for me. I wish something more specific made it stand out, whether it be flirty, a go to day (or evening) wear contender, sexy; just ""something"" to give it just a little bit of an edge and personality.",09/03/17 02:19,Cloverstone
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Nice lazy summer day scent, nothing extraordinary or original but pleasing and easy to wear. I don't understand the marketing for this perfume to me it's not a ¨city¨ scent at all, it would be too sickly sweet for the subway, people at the office, the pollution etc... I think it would perfectly suit a girl in a barn taking care of her horse before going on a picnic or swimming in the lake on a very hot day. Maybe it's the way the gardenia in this is mixed with the fruits: it needs a lot of space to not suffocate you, therefore the image of an outdoorsy girl..",07/06/17 07:34,hilili
Downtown Calvin Klein,"One of the few CK scents I don't like. Too sweet and floral, both I don't care for.",07/02/17 23:26,Jacquelyn1
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Like many other reviewers, I don't get it (haha..). That's not to say I don't like it because I'm not sure yet.

I've found that on the skin it's got more personality, and when sprayed on clothes everything is muddled, nondescript and just ""okay"" smelling. So I'd suggest testing it on your skin rather than clothes or a piece of paper.

So here's where it gets weird- on my skin, the fruits come through but if I weren't reading the notes I wouldn't have known which fruits they were. Then a strong, peppery note kicks in which mingles with the fruits in a strange way. Then there's a woodsy element trying to play with all of this. So again, it's not that I don't like it... I'm just not sure what to make of it yet. Sometimes with fragrance I find that it becomes more likable when I get a clear image of what it's supposed to be, or my interpretation of it.

If it's true that the goal for this was to become as popular (if not more so) than Euphoria, they've certainly missed the mark!",06/20/17 20:43,inc0rporeal
Downtown Calvin Klein,This is the only perfume I have tested so many times and still have no idea what it smells like. I just dont get it? It vanishes after an hour it starts out strong but not in a celebrity sweet way just strong a muddled mess. I do not dislike it I just cannot make head or tail from it and the pepper doesnt bother me I know some people are having trouble with that. I will keep trying. Same problem with marc jacobs decadence I test it then cannot remember a thing about it and katy perry mad potion the new pink one.

Downtown Calvin Klein,"I was given a sample of this and have worn it a few times to give it a chance, but I'm not a fan. The pink pepper is way too strong for my liking. It dominated the scent for the first 2-3 hours of wear. I know that pink pepper isn't supposed to smell spicy but rosy, but every perfume I've worn with a pink pepper note has a spicy kick to it. And Downtown has an overload of kick that I feel like I'm walking around with pepper in my pocket.

I will say that I really like the last couple hours, when it wears very close to the skin. It's when the pink pepper has calmed down, and the gardenia and pear smell quite lovely. There's a light sweetness, from either the pear or plum, that projects in the heat and I wish it were stronger throughout because it smells incredible. In its twilight, I can detect an earthy (almost dirty) smell, which I don't mind.

Downtown lasts 6+ hours and has average sillage. Overall, there's nothing really special about this. The first half of wear is spicy, the second half is nice but ordinary. 2/5",02/07/17 12:20,wyrdlam
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Smells horrible, but won't get off my skin so has good lasting power.

Downtown Calvin Klein,"This is the only CK perfume I own. I was hooked from the first spray. The bottle attracted me. It's fruity & floral & quite sharp at first then dries down to a creamy sweetness. I absolutely love it & it's holding it's own in our hideous Australian summer. Not at all cloying - fresh & vibrant
And I see it's been discontinued! No! I must have more...

Downtown Calvin Klein,"The initial citrus hit quickly dries down to a musky floral which is very pleasant and not overly sweet. Nothing super special, but nice for every day",12/10/16 02:50,teapeach
Downtown Calvin Klein,"After blind buying and smelling it, I can't see why this isn't more popular. It's a really nice blend of citrus, white floral, pepper, woody and musk notes. It's definitely clean smelling and not too feminine or fruity. I used to have Elizabeth Taylor Violet Eyes but the woods were just too much for me. Downtown features quite a few similar notes but balances it with other fresh, aquatic ingredients. Because it's decently complex, I can easily smell notes from other perfumes I own. Right now I have a 1 oz and I'm thinking about purchasing a larger bottle since this one is discontinued and very reasonably priced online for the quality.

I get decent wear from this. The top notes base quickly but the base stays for several hours. This is low-moderate sillage. Enough for others to smell but not so strong that it will knock someone out. Should be appropriate for nearly any work setting.",11/23/16 16:56,alyxdavidson
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Nice, sweet, cool perfume with noticeable pear and lemon notes, I also detect some pink flowers - most similar to sweet pea.

Downtown Calvin Klein,"I love this. It's very very pretty, fresh and yummy! It's definitely one of my favourites. I really love all the notes in it, and love it more each time I wear it. And I love wearing it with other perfumes too, especially Chloé Narcisse. They smell divine together.

Great longevity and lovely sillage. Very good quality I think.

I also love the packaging - bottle and box. Very pretty colours, and I adore the shape of the bottle.

It's pretty perfect altogether, in my opinion.

Edit: By the way, I wish people would read the 'odor profile' that Fragrantica has for pink pepper, so they would realise that it is not a spice, but a rose smell. Here is their description: ""Odor profile: Although technically a pepper berry, it doesn't smell spicy, but rosy. A very popular modern accent piece in fragrances that provides a contemporary rosy note"".",11/09/16 15:39,Petunia Peacock
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Lovely!!! A really nice perfume. I love it!

I think it's very interesting and unique. Fresh, sweet, softly oriental, woodsy, lovely citrus and fruit aspect. Soft and creamy as well, and such a delight to wear. Very long lasting, and beautiful sillage. In fact I think it's pretty perfect really.

Calvin Klein's perfumes are really good on me. I love the bottle too. It's so lovely and chunky, and very unique and easy to hold. I love that Calvin Klein is always understated - not show-offy. Basic and very good quality. Very special to me. I also love the soft pretty colour of the liquid. And, I especially love the vivid fuchsia pink in the cap, and of the box. Fab!

Beautiful job as usual Calvin!!!",11/08/16 17:06,Everything Jet Black
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I think Downtown is a terrific perfume! Lovely, soft floral, and sweet citrus, with a beautiful incense enhanced spiciness. The pink pepper adds a gorgeous rosy edge, and the gardenia is perfect. It's delicious. The pear and plum are so juicy, and the cedar and amazing vetiver add depth and strength. It lasts so well; all day, and is still there very nicely the next morning. And the sillage is easily a few feet, if not the whole room!

It's quite delectable. I love Calvin's perfumes; I think they're all very good. And the bottle is great. So chunky and beautifully crafted. The rich pink inside the lid is superb. Thank you Calvin Klein, for another gem.

I love it.",11/08/16 00:02,Moonbeam Blue
Downtown Calvin Klein,"This one doesn't really do it for me. I find this to be the wrong scent with the wrong name with the wrong bottle with the wrong face and it does not surprise me that it more or less flopped. ""The new Euphoria"" it certainly wasn't...

I'm partial against pink pepper but I was still willing to give this one a try. It smells very now, as in, this was probably released in the 10's. Slightly peppery fresh splashy vaguely fruity, ""ozonic"", cool. It doesn't inspire me, but there is nothing ""wrong"" with it. It certainly deserved a better fate than this, but alas.",11/07/16 03:37,Madrona
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I really love this scent! I don't know why it got discontinued. This is by far my favourite scent by Calvin Klein. It reminds me a little bit of Classique by Jean Paul Gaultier, one of my favourite scents and also of Touch of Pink by Lacoste that I love and Guess Seductive that I like.

The combination of citrus, including Italian lemon and bergamot, neroli, pear, gardenia, pink pepper, violet leaves, cedar, incense and musk is really magical!

This scent is fresh, but also oriental because of the incense and spicy because of the pepper.

It smells citrusy-sweet, a little bit like candy, but so extraordinary because of the incense and the pepper. I can't stop sniffing myself. The longevity is really great, when I wake up the next morning, I still smell it and by now, I am wearing this scent for a week straight, my sheets and my clothes are also smelling like it and I keep sniffing everything all the time. This scent is perfect for daytime, but still special enough for parties and I also wore it last friday evening to my baby sister's birthday party in a restaurant.

Because it got discontinued and my best friend loves it, I went to smell it because it was such a bargain at the drugstore: 50 ml for € 23,-. At her request I bought it for her and I was allowed to open it and smell it for myself. I liked it and kept the open bottle for myself and bought another new one for her.

But then I wore it and I totally fell in love with it. So this week it is on sale € 25,- voor 90 ml and I had a coupon for € 5,- discount if I spend € 25,-, so I immediality picked up a larger bottle for myself, to store for when I run out of the 50 ml.

I am so glad that my best friend told me about this scent:-D!",10/12/16 12:31,wendyha
Downtown Calvin Klein,"One of my favorite fragrances, probably because of the main notes of pear and gardenia. I love the fruity opening of it and musky dry down.

Downtown Calvin Klein,"Wow, I never would have tried this fragrance if I had looked up the accords listed -(citrus as top accord?) and read the mean (some very nasty) reviews! This fragrance is more outdoorsy that city to me- camping in the woods by a creek with some little spicy wild flowers nearby. I'm happy to have found this crisp, cedar- freshy that really is a great day wear staple. I'm a teacher and don't want LOUD or candy smell or sneeze-inducing fragrance choking my students throughout the day. I like that this scent doesn't present some loud statement, and is just a light, slightly mysterious, pleasing scent that won't waft into anyone else's personal space. I will use the heck out of this, and it is cheap since I guess it didn't make a grand enough statement on release.

Now, about the notes: there is something intriguing and subtle about the cedar, pink pepper, and I guess incense (not sure if the incense is the smoky vibe) with understated floral that makes this so fresh. If there's a lot of citrus, I'm not smelling it directly so it's blended well. The sweetness of the fruit is not too sweet, just perfect. 2hrs in it is more sweet, less spice with a creamy musky dry down lasting about 7 hrs. Total on me today. Definitely just a skin scent within about 4hrs. I recommend this for people who like subtle non-perfumy scents that are fresh.",09/09/16 17:50,Erinbath22

It wasn't until I gave avoids pray of it on my skin that magic started to happen. It is inoffensive perfect for work or having a coffee, going shopping or to the movies with out knocking anyone out. I have to agree it is doing its own thing. Spicy fruity floral incense woody musk. What a well mixed beautiful combination these notes turn into.

Downtown Calvin Klein,"On my skin:

At first it's a bit of fruit, but turns into a sweet woody powder, pink peppery incense.

The name - Downtown - does not match the scent. It's more of an outdoor, backyard party -- with stringed lights, fun drinks, good beer and friends. A glitter tank, faded jeans and bare feet.

On my skin this is more like a spicy woody scent, and I think it smells pretty good (of course or I wouldn't be wearing this). It is my work scent since its not too loud and just safe for when you want to smell good all year round.

I am not exaggerating when i say that I own over 100 fragrances in my collection. I love all genres so I do not discriminate. I happen to be a HUGE lover of florals though. Downtown starts out spicy and musky on me but also very fresh. As it begins to dry down the BEAUTIFUL florals starts to chime in and I am in ABSOLUTE LOVE. I cannot explain how gorgeous this smells on me!! It's a combination of florals, fresh, subtle sweetness, with a hint of musky spiciness. This doesn't smell like anything else in my colossal perfume collection. Every now and then i get a whiff and it honestly takes my breath away. I suspect that the people that find this regular and not special does not have the right chemistry to pull it off. I adore this. If I could possibly compare this to any other fragrance i would compare it to ED hard Love & Luck with the addition of the most BEAUTIFUL captivating, breathtaking florals EVER! Best Calvin Klein, hands down...in my opinion. It's not the type of fragrance you want to stuff your nose into, just wait for it to waft up to your nose and you'll be swept away. THAT BEAUTIFUL! Not boring or mediocre at all. Your boyfriend will love this on you. Very alluring and sexy.",10/05/15 06:59,shoshana25
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Really nice citrus sweet aquatic scent. I love citrus perfumes in autumn/fall time they remain fresh and mysterious whilst also being ripe and energetic. This perfume is a feel good perfume. I wore it in 2013 in autumn time and I have just received my second bottle of this stuff today in the post- the drydown is quite dewy citrus fruits it is somewhat balmy and tends to linger a while on my skin.
Plum and lemon blended together are the most prominent notes to my nose-surprisingly they work well together. Pear and gardenia are the base notes for me I have to sniff hard to get a whiff of those, though they are present but to me the lemon and plum dominate. Also do not be put of by the pepper notes- you cannot individually detect the pepper in this it is very well blended and is simply used to diffuse the other notes into one another. This perfume has a sweetness It may be the combination of the citrus fruits and pepper together that create the sweet smell but to me this scent is somewhat citrus sweet-although not synthetic candy sweet. It also is very aquatic smells marine and sporty sometimes, other times balmy, then sweet, then sharp citrus, then dewy fruity; this perfume is an interesting one for me it has a lot of different 'feels' to it- it is constantly changing on my skin and I like the fact it does that- it does not bore me. However, there is nothing overly extreme about this perfume it is a variety of changeable pleasantries for me. This makes a safe gift for anyone and is easily wearable for everyday use. I really love this perfume in autumn time. It is soft, comforting, warm and inviting to me. I find it soothing and interesting simultaneously.

Downtown Calvin Klein,"I have tried this perfume both on my skin and clothes and I must say that this was VERY long lasting. On my skin it lasted almost all day and on my scarf I could smell it for days!
It smells very soft and quite sweet but overall I think this is a nice,easy to wear daytime perfume. I think this perfumes is worth a try.
And also, its smells very similar to Roberto Cavalli I love Her.",08/28/15 07:17,Brunette_Bombshell
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I was lucky enough to have found this on clearance at walmart of all places for 2 dollars...

Surprisingly, I really like this perfume. It's soft and sweet. The fruit dominates at first but they dwindle to powdery florals. It's not a night out perfume. it's more like a downtown spring shopping day perfume. Downtown is a perfume for those who want to smell sweet up close, and they don't want everyone within 5 feet to smell it.

I don't understand the whole ""old lady"" aspect. I don't smell it in the perfume. If the powder was stronger then yes I could understand that but it definitely doesn't remind me of an old lady.

Also I put one spray on my wrist (blending it to the other) over 12 hours ago and I can. I can still kind of smell it. I would say the perfume lasts around 6 to 8 hours.",07/25/15 20:51,stina91

Downtown Calvin Klein,"Dominated by pear, starts off very inoffensive, light and summery, but after a couple of hours smells a bit like a cheap, slightly stale body spray. This perfume as the reviewer below has identified has little or no personality to it, it's like it has something missing - it's like it could be one of many prototypes that are produced before you get to a blend that is worth marketing. From Calvin Klein - I am surprised. 3/10 could do a lot better.",06/18/15 23:19,shopgirl
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Soft, gentle, comfortable floral/fruity scent. Not much personality to it but that also makes it pretty inoffensive when wearing in situations where you don't want everyone else in the room to be smacked in the face with your fragrance. It's pretty & I like it but it's quite a departure from CK's other, more bolder perfumes where each had a distinct signature & personality. You'd be hard-pressed to identify this in a crowd (whereas most other CK perfumes are pretty recognisable).",06/18/15 22:19,epiphany

Downtown Calvin Klein,"Honestly, despite this fragrance being disappointing for some and perhaps in its success I rather liked it. It's definitely an aquatic floral and because of the citrus notes, it comes off rather sharp on me. I do like it, as an office friendly - safe everyday scent but I can't smell it for too long. The sharpness/sourness on me becomes overwhelming, but it does have a freshness from the aquatic bent and the floral fruit aspect is pleasant without being that generic celebrity flanker concoction. My mother actually stole it from me and I'm happy to let her keep it. At the discount prices $20 or so for 3.4oz, it's actually a pretty sweet deal.",03/19/15 18:41,pinkchevalier
Downtown Calvin Klein,"This fragrance isn't a heartbreaker...it isn't bold or brave (or popular, as I can gather from the reviews and price I got it for at TJ Maxx) but I think it's a nice citrus that's good for bumming around the house or for a very casual outing. For me it's the perfect ""filler"" fragrance...it's clean and totally unpretentious. Something to wear with yoga pants and a comfy sweater. I have received compliments on it, but it's mostly been from my fellow Coloradoans that are particularly outdoor-sy and generally favor my simple, linear fragrances.

I can see why it bombed (with a name like 'Downtown' you should be aiming for some kind of personality or edge) but I hardly mind the big 3oz bottle I got for $15! Lasting power is ok but I wouldn't be afraid to over-do this one, might as well treat it like a light body mist over an eau de parfum.

My review doesn't sound too positive but I'm honestly totally pleased with it! I thought the yummy pink pepper dry down was nice and this will be a great fragrance for spring for me!",01/31/15 02:50,thehazysea

Like a mix of citrus and powder. I enjoyed it the first time i used it but i started to realize that the more that i use it, the more i dislike it. After only using this for about a month i was already getting very sick of it. The smell gives me a headache now (im NOT sensitive to alot of scents)... the good thing is that it does last a long time. Id say 7 hours. In conclusion, It seems like one of those perfumes that you may love at first but youll get sick of it real quick.",01/21/15 15:04,anetta22
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I've had an interesting interaction with Downtown - I bought it when it came out and then returned it the next day ( didn't need it, although i didn't hate it). I just repurchased it (despite its odd name and fascinating pencil shavings hint) because this perfume is not going down without a fight. It wants so bad to be noticed and is determined to prove that it is not forgettable.

Downtown smells wonderful on me and I enjoy it's lovely prettiness. It has to work hard though - in response to many compliments about how great I smell, I get a look of shock when I say it's Downtown!",01/15/15 18:53,Cams
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I agree that this is not a fragrance to associate with City Women ... they would wear something along the lines of Chanel No5.

Personally, it lasts for hours on me. I went out shopping and I wore this fragrance, sprayed where I was supposed to and the SA that sold me another Fragrance could still smell it on me at approx 3hrs after I sprayed her.

It is a very pretty fragrance that I wear with love and pride. My go to for shopping as it does last a good amount of time on me. Maybe that is what is meant by downtown ... does not always mean clubbing. Afternoon tea in a hotel sort of fragrance.

I would also not say she is devoid of personality. She has one but she is coy about whom she allows to be friends with her, maybe her wallflower status was because she had been betrayed at a very precarious stage in her life so therefore is the type to hide her heart. It is hard to get to know her but if you do manage to crack your way in she will be your best friend for life. Be careful with her though, because you never know when the sweet might become sour!

Hidden away in the corner at a friends party she sits and listens intently as you whisper your secrets to her but refuses to tell you hers. She is always dressed oddly but it fits her. She wants to know all about you ... but you will never understand her.

At the moment I am one of those lucky few whom she has allowed to call her a friend.

I get the peppery quality more than anything and tea, which must be the bergamot, and a warmth that must come from the Cedar and Musk. Nothing overly citric at all.

This was my first 50ml Designer bottle I bought for myself when I had some good news. This fragrance will always sum up that memory for me of winningfor the first time in my life.

I am currently wwaring her on my decollete and I am wearing Alien on my wrists, goes well together I think.

Downtown Calvin Klein,"I have to say, I really do love this perfume. I'm generally pretty picky about perfumes. I've spent the last few months searching for a new signature scent, and I just couldn't find what I was looking for. I absolutely can't stand the new trend towards gourmands, as most, to me, smell like a bakery or a candy store, which seems very juvenile to me. I don't like heavy, cloying florals either, and many of them give me a brutal head ache or an allergic reaction… Then I smelled Down Town…

I agree with other reviewers that I don't really think of ""down town"" when I smell this, but that is OK with me. At first I get more of a ""farmer's market"" smell… fresh ripe berries and fruit, which I really love. It is sweet, but not too sweet. just more fresh and juicy. After the fruit dies down it really starts to warm up and the woods and pepper come through… it gets really sexy and close to the skin. After trying a ton of different perfumes even my husband said ""that is the best one so far.""

I love the 'aquatic' aspect too. It keeps the whole thing really light and fresh and breezy and sexy, without feeling 'beach-y"".

I feel like Down Town really suits my style, which is more tom boy, natural, modern, bohemian (I guess like Rooney Mara) and NOT overly girly or glamorous or dramatic.",12/23/14 09:29,newbie30

Downtown Calvin Klein,"So, I bought a 50ml bottle of this perfume as a gift for a relative.(Obviously had to test it myself!)

It's soft, innofensive, and linear. It's classy, it's sophisticated. It made me think of VB's 'Intamately' perfume. The name doesn't suit, because I can't think of anyone who would wear this ""clubbing"" per say.

I wouldn't buy for myself, though my 51 year old mother loved it.

My own opinion, as fruity floral lover, it's that a little too sheer for my liking. I think it's the gardenia. My skin reacts HORRIBLY to anything with gardenia in, so any perfume that features that note autmatically turns into an ""old lady"" scent.

I'd give it a 6/10. It's very pretty and pleasant, but I would not buy a bottle for myself.",10/13/14 14:40,Jasmindee

Downtown Calvin Klein,"Pretty much the exact opposite of ""downtown"" in my opinion. ""Country Club"" might have been a more appropriate name. ""Nursing Home"", if you're being a bit snarky. It's soft, sweet and safe. It's certainly inoffensive, especially due to its low sillage and minimal longevity, and would not be out of place at church on Sunday morning, or when you go to visit granny in the care home (she'll love the prominent gardenia, if it's still there by the time you arrive).

Anyhow,people who are sensitive to stronger perfumes may fancy Downtown for its softness & if you have a boyfriend/husband,who doesn't like strong scents,I'd recommend you to try Downtown.
It is not a special occasion fragrance,not something you will remember in a few years,but it is a bit edgy & feminine at the same time. Really nice sweet & citrusy blend. Its warm notes always make me think of autumn & New York,maybe because I bought it in September and took it on a trip to the Big Apple.

It's a bright youthful citrus start that dries down very quickly and vanishes. I do wish the citrus lasted just a little longer but it's followed by a soft floral that made me feel like this would be a good perfume for a young sophisticated girl to wear to the office or during the day. It's pretty and young without feeling childish and has a quiet confidence. After an hour or so, I started getting lots of gardenia, pleasant, but not overwhelming - which gardenia can be if it's too strong. Two hours in there's still a soft sweet floral clinging to my skin.

Downtown Calvin Klein,"I just got this fragrance recently. I live in the UK and there's a gift set on sale for £23 which is quite cheap for a quality fragrance at beauty base. I absolutely LOVE this perfume!!! This is my 'first' perfume in terms of me actually buying one so I was very picky in choosing one. I went into the store with a relatively open mind knowing that I liked scents which were light and a little on the fruity side since I don't like too much floral or too much musk. I tested a lot of perfumes but this one really grabbed my attention in a subtle way. A lot of perfumes on the market now seem to have 'distinctive' scents but this one is not very distinctive, it's really soft and pleasant perfect for any time of the year.

From this perfume I initially get the blast of fruity notes of lemon, bergamot, pear and plum. I find this sweet and nice it definitely awakens my senses in the morning when I spray it that's for sure. On my skin during the dry down I get a lot of incense and musk which mixes with the fruitiness and it's quite sensual I enjoy it a lot. The only gripe I have is that it is a 'skin scent' it stays close to the skin and does not have great projection at all and unfortunately it does not last very long probably maximum of 6 hours or so for me. That's okay though considering it's really inoffensive and inexpensive. I can spray 2-3 times or more and not worry about the scent being overpowering because it's definitely not, so for those of you looking for a daytime suitable scent in any environment this one is for you!

I would even go as far as to say to blind buy it if you can't test it because it's so inoffensive and 'safe' I think, have a whiff hopefully you will love it as much as I do!!! :D",02/04/14 14:31,thang92

Beautiful flowers- but not straight from the florist , mainly dominated by gardenia and violets with pink icing . Oh yes the smell is definitely pink , but at the same time very feminine , somehow I do not associate me with a Barbie doll and little girls . Rather romantic with a woman in dress and sandals. The smell is very ethereal , spring-summer , fits into the urban lifestyle. For me it is an unusual and charming , just a pleasant for longer . I test it again now and I am always delighted. It has a certain something that makes I can not break the nose of the wrist. My man also really like and promised me bottle .

Towards the end, when the floral aspect becomes less distinct, it kind of reminds me of berry vanilla combination of CK One Shock, but a bit smoother and less cloying.

The sillage is soft and the longevity is around 9 hours. It's a sweet, pleasant and inoffensive scent that could do well as an everyday fragrance or a safe gift for those who aren't that into perfumes. But I don't think I would particularly recommend it.",12/07/13 13:26,StellaDiverFlynn
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I tried this out in the store and rather thought I liked it enough to buy a small travel size bottle.

I was very disappointed.",12/07/13 08:28,chrissyc15
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I use this perfume when I want to smell pretty, elegant and casual. It does not really stand out, but is a nice touch to overall visage. It does not bother anyone,and although woody/sweet, it is not a headache maker. However, it is not as unique as some of my favourites.

What I smell on my skin is a lot different than on the paper strip. I cannot detect citrus at all - Downtown is not a fresh splash scent for me. But somewhere from below there has something bergamot-y in it when you overcome the first and quite intensive powdery musky feeling. For me - powdery, woody, sweet (but not heavy) with a slight citrusy and floral touch in the background which is more detectable as the time passes. I actually really like it, it comes out as a nice calming fragrance.",12/06/13 15:18,Lumira
Downtown Calvin Klein,"My immediate sense was one of pleasure. This is a scent that hugs you and just makes you feel comfortable. Unfortunately, it's similar to many others on the market today. Is it the pear or the plum again that makes it another common scent that's flooding today's market? Come the dry down, the pepper mixes in delicately to make this a soft fragrance perfect for any age, wearable to the office and perfect for day wear. It's a good relaxing perfume, one to go to sleep with, to spritz your pillows and dream. There's a fruity composition to Downtown and it makes the name a misnomer for some who might have been expecting something else to live up to this name. But, people should learn the name and the face that pushes the fragrance shouldn't matter about what's truly in the bottle. What is important is how a perfume reacts with your chemistry. If it makes you feel good, then it works. Downtown works as another fruity blend of 2013, adding the pepper with a dose of musk. If you don't already own this type of fragrance, certainly give it a trial run. If you do, sample it and see if it's one you'd like to add to your stock. Nothing special, nothing to write home about, nothing to remembered by. Just something comfortable, like an old favorite sweatshirt. Regardless, another one chalked up to the perfume annals of Calvin Klein.",11/30/13 00:36,SorceressOfTheDark
Downtown Calvin Klein,"FIRST IMPRESSION

As some of the reviews said, this may not be anybodys signature perfume, but it is a perfekt busy day perfume for busy women who want to smell nice and not overwhelming in work, while driving children to school and at luch ect. It sill is pretty and the musk makes it quite sensual but the pear and lemon create some freshness about it. I guess what I'm trying to say here it's a universal perfume, and I quite like it, and that'sa big deal cause I normally don't like any perfume without Jasmine in it :)

UPDATE

Sadly after a couple of hours neither the sillagde nor the smell itself passed the test. Somehow all I can smell now is the pear, but not the fresh pear, more like a fermented pear. I can swear something close to vanilla also. All the freshnes is long gone so its only sweet and musk now and I dont think someone looking for a hip city type modern perfume, that this is advertised as, would apreciate it.",11/26/13 12:36,Paulina Ostrowska

It opened, I could smell a little pear and bergamot and lemon, but at the same time it was very musky. Not a true floral. Not fruity-floral the way EL Pleasures Bloom, Versace bright crystal are.. I was expecting more brightness, sharp florals, more citrus. None of that brightness. If this was a color it would be gray fading into dark which creates a musty smell. It dried down to a leather smell, except there is no leather. Kind of reminded me a little of fan di fendi (leather accord) and Vera Wang Lovestruck (musky dry fruit). This is a very dry fragrance with little juiciness from the fruit. I smell almost no floral. It is not a scent I would pay a whole lot of money for, because I don't love it enough to use it. Do not go off of what it smelled like in the magazine strips, but actually test it yourself.",11/08/13 18:58,Eaugirlspirit
Downtown Calvin Klein,Basically all 2013 perfumes are pear fragrances.... so boring....,11/08/13 12:46,susieqrj
Downtown Calvin Klein,"As someone mentioned before Downtosupermarket would be the more suitable name for this one.
Yet another generic fruity/floralish with some incense in the base for good measure.
CK stopped to exist in my life soon after Obsession, with just a short period of Eternity that was new and original, but also aggressive and killed my nerves in 2 months.
On first sniff ALL I could smell was pear, a big big, ripe and annoying PEAR. I'm partial because I hate pear. It kills everything and makes any perfume smell like a joke.
This is just my personal taste, of course, but the opening was not inviting. The rest of the perfume is simply pleasant in a very generic way, it could be put in the safe&inoffensive category, if it ever really existed such a category. It doesn't exist in my book, but it seems that a certain class of perfumes have become so common and acquired that people just don't make a fuss about them.

This is not bad, if you don't mind pear, it's easily wearable, you just dress up in the morning, spray some Downtown (what a name...) and enter the big mechanism of everyday life feeling more or less fit for anything or at least in the stream and not disturbing. Unless you meet a pear-hater on your way, but that's not important based on statistics. Almost everyone wants to smell pear earluy in the morning on a packed train! That ""almost"" is me. No matter.
Someone will give you compliments, because it actually smells pleasant.
It has a good lasting power, but the price is too high and the bottle looks like those copycats from street vendors.",11/08/13 02:52,Mellyhelly
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I felt like I should review CK's Downtown just to defend it from all the bad reviews. For all the nay-sayers out there keep in mind that every perfume has a time and place, and for Downtown it's the everyday.

To me this perfume epitomizes the modern working woman who wants a perfume that makes her feel confident, modern, maybe even edgy, but can also be appropriate for her busy day-to-day life. The incense and musk in this (which is what remains after the top notes are gone) give it an edge, while being discreet enough to wear to the office, to go pick up your kids from daycare, to come home and cook dinner, and yet sensual enough for when your husband leans in at the end of the night for a kiss.

Many complain about longevity... on me this actually lasts a good 8 hours, but because the sillage is so soft (I can only smell it on my hand) it may appear as if it dissapears quickly.

If you want a perfume that you can wear with confidence no matter where you go, or if you want something more discreet (for those of us who let our personalities do the talking and not our perfumes), then this is for you. If that's not what you're looking for, then move on.",10/31/13 13:11,iggypop
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I liked it more than I expected to. Frankly, I expected this fragrance to piss me off because lately I've encountered a lot of fragrances with notes I like that smell like... nothing.
Well, Downtown is hardly exciting, but it's not bad. The gardenia is VERY mild, but it smells like gardenia. The fruits aren't overly sweet. It's quite airy because of the violet leaf.
Nothing particularly Downtown about this fragrance, but it's nice and safe and definitely fits right in with the minimalist Calvin Klein concept I grew up with (90's).",10/26/13 19:54,2746cstreet
Downtown Calvin Klein,"I smelled it even before it came out on the market as I was in a perfume shop and a representative from Calvin Klein was showing it to the shop assistant, explaining what to tell to future buyers in order to saddle them with this. She gave me a generous spray on my wirst and I rembeber thinking 'how can they possibly have come down with this totally uninspiring, boring and average perfume?'. Nothing to add, as a lover of Euphoria this is a total letdown.",10/24/13 11:26,sheherazade80
Downtown Calvin Klein,"CK's Downtown is an inoffensive fruity floral with a pinch of green in it.
This makes a perfect gift, everyone can enjoy it (I dare say, if they are not too much into perfume in general).
It's rather light, and fades quickly.
Perfecty fine to be worn at a business lunch or in school.
There was just no WOW for me.


However on a personal note, I can't help but smile over the fact that everything about this is so perfectly falling in to place, the shallowness of the scent, the uninspired bottle, the plain-jane name, the ""bland new star"" representing it- I mean (I'm getting a little off-topic here but, campaignwise) look at this, and then take a quick look YSL Manifesto, exciting scent, intriguing name, elegant bottle, and the glamorous (crazy talented) Jessica Chastain?! Well, now actually that would be worth a review.",10/18/13 15:07,mocou
Downtown Calvin Klein,"First impression with this one was ""HUH??"".

1) I don't get most of the notes listed.
2) I agree with everyone saying the hype about this is much ado about nothing.
3) The bottle is just...awkward.
4) This is like every other sweet, generic, boring Floral out there (Modern Muse, I'm looking in your direction, dear).
5) The price tag on this is ridiculous.

Calvin Klein and Estee Lauder...Please, PLEASE, for the sake of us Perfumistas who do appreciate your brand and a lot of your work, JOIN the 21st Century :/ Please?

In a nutshell...this is yet another safe, floral, short lived scent that is absolutely forgettable and like Modern Muse, I'd recommend this to shy women who are uncomfortable with being noticed(genuinely, I don't mean any offense by that as I understand there is a market for it).

This one wasn't worth the wait, Sorry.",10/13/13 01:22,EmilyTheStrange
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Decent perfume. I like it. The only thing I don't like is the bottle top. It moves around a lot. I wear this when I'm just going out to the drug store or when I forget to put something on before I leave home I use the rollerball I have. I get multiple compliments throughout the day from customers when I wear it to work. The dry down is much more pleasant and floral which I like (I love strong florals). When I first spray it the fruit is too strong but goes away fast enough. I don't wear it nearly enough for a full sized bottle like I bought. A lot of people get carried away with the reviews. Let's calm down with all the ""WORST PERFUME OF 2013!!1!"" Talk. It's not that serious! Don't be so negative. People come here for their hobbies or passions and it's a drag. If you don't like it, you just say you don't care for it. Problem solved. All in all, if I ever run out (I don't use it enough to run out anytime soon) I would definitely consider getting it (in a much smaller size) again. It's a fun around the house fragrance.",10/13/13 00:31,JordanWenk

I will admit it isn't super unique, but there's something I like about it nonetheless. I certainly would not consider this the next euphoria.

Downtown Calvin Klein,"My first impressions of this fragrance - very soft, delicate and warm. As it develops on my skin over few hours it becomes stronger and warmer. It is a day parfume, very comforting, makes me feel grown up and feminine in a non-defensive and non-offensive way. At the same time I could imagine it wearing in bed. As it is very soft and close to skin it is suitable for work, school, as well as for intimate holiday with your buddy. Only the lucky ones who get close to you enough, can actually smell it. And I like it a lot!",09/30/13 08:10,dana.kalnina

Downtown Calvin Klein,"Downmarket would be a more appropriate name. This one is a letdown for sure.

The lasting power is also extremely poor.",09/23/13 15:37,Jomoves
Downtown Calvin Klein,"The name may be misleading...as many have described, this is not a super-charged urban mixture. It's sweet, soft and gentle, which suits me just fine. I happen to love it, and was delighted with the extra smaller bottles that Boscov's is offering right now. And you need to have a purse size with you, because it's not long lasting, as others have noted, so spray away!
I find this to be fruity but NOT singularly, and not run of the mill. It's not a typical scent in any way...understated but unique. If you appreciate soft, delicate fragrances, I recommend Down Town!",09/20/13 14:58,Flowercat
Downtown Calvin Klein,"Just tried this yesterday in a department store and hadn't heard of it's release before. I just happened to see it, along with some other new perfumes, at the end of some of the perfume shelves, and not because the bottle is particularly eye catching or pretty ... it's really not!

The perfume is just OK ... a fairly bland, generic fruity / floral and I'd have thought it might be a bit more interesting and perhaps sexy. I can't even remember if I sprayed any on my arm (I tested several perfumes, as usual when I'm browsing perfume departments!) but if I did it didn't stand out from the others in any way. I did test it on a Down Town perfume card though and although it's pleasant enough I suppose, there's something about it that I find slightly annoying ... I have no clue what it is but I'm not crazy about it to say the least! Oh, actually (just checking the perfume notes above!) it may be the Tunisian Neroli and the incense ... yuck!

Unlike a couple of other reviewers, it doesn't remind me at all of Champs Elysees or CK One Shock, which are both much nicer perfumes in my opinion. Champs Elysees is much more classy, elegant and expensive smelling and CK One Shock is much more gourmand, sassy and likeable. What Down Town does remind me of though is some of the Paris Hilton perfumes ... generic, fruity perfumes that smell kind of cheap, like fruity body sprays!

As for the commercial for Down Town ... Rooney Mara is an odd choice for such an underwhelming, relatively bland, generic perfume! She's quite edgy and a bit quirky I think and this perfume is neither of those things! I'd have thought someone like Katie Holmes or Reese Witherspoon would be more suitable 'representatives' for a perfume like this.

Overall, Down Town is just an overpiced, OK'ish perfume in a dull bottle with a designer name plastered on it. I'll definitely give it a miss!",09/17/13 12:57,Kittycat63

Downtown Calvin Klein,"Downtown starts as a sweeter floral with the pear, plum, and neroli. Within minutes, the violet leaf, incense, and musk melange join the party. It is such a pleasant sweet floral fragrance! The lemon and bergamot well add to the freshness of this perfume.

I find Downtown a lovely aura scent, in that it is not made for the nose pressed directly on the skin. When I sniff on the point of spray, there is something odd and bitter underneath that can be described as slightly herby or spicy. This may be from the musk, incense, and peony fruits.

Overall, it is a light, sweet, and pleasant fragrance. It's noticed more easily in the closer range, so when my friend wears it, I take an extended sniff during our hugs. :) Downtown definitely has longevity, however, it is a bit lacking in the projection department.",09/13/13 07:51,Layzie

Downtown Calvin Klein,"Very disappointing, generic, synthetic scent. Not offensive, but very little longevity, just a topnote of citrus and deep plum. This smelled very plasticky and synthetic, like it was mixed up in a test tube and some fake smelling chemical stabilizer jumped in and took over the scent profile.

The black band on the bottle makes me giggle. Because it's CK. They make inner-wears. And they put their signature inner-wear band on the bottle. Simple but fun.

On paper, the citrus really sticks out here; however on skin it’s the vetiver and tea that take most of the focus. Soft, slightly fruity, subtle, comforting. Perfect for an office or school setting, as well as lounging or bedtime. Longevity is slightly above average, and projection is pretty good.

Scent wise, this fragrance is definitely at the top of my list of favorites in the entire CK One line (along with Ck One Summer 2010 and Ck One Essence 2024).",06/20/25 20:04,Mr. Fusion
CK Everyone Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"I've blind bought this fragrance around 2024 and I have to say it's a safe blind buy and very suitable for office/school setting because of it's inoffensive and fresh smell. Whenever I smell it, it has this uplifting and stress relieving feeling that I get and the smell is also nostalgic, prolly because I used it in our trip to Japan around a year ago. With that said, the downside is that, it's performance is not the greatest.. It's inconsistent, sometimes it's short lived, sometimes it's long lasting. And another is, my skin reacts badly especially when I apply it in my neck areas. This prolly might be me since I also get irritation when using certain skin care products containing lemon.

CK Everyone Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"It's an ok fragrance. The opening is very green, sort of like leaves and grass after rain. After the citrus kicks in, it develops into fresh lemongrass on my skin. This perfume is nothing challenging - a simple, green citrus scent, slightly masculine leaning in my opinion, but still very versatile. It's the longevity that's the problem - it seemed to evaporate from my skin within an hour tops, so I see no point in buying it again (especially since there's so many more interesing fragrances available on the market).",11/27/24 01:18,lablablador

CK Everyone Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Haters gonna hate… I find this perfume to be one of the easiest going fragrances that I’ve ever owned. It’s versatile, inoffensive, light and it has medium longevity and sillage. It works very well all year around, but it feels a bit misplaced and odd in the dark and cold december nights. It would still be more than wearable even with Santa knocking on the door, but it would just feel a bit misplaced.
That’s the thing with Calvin Klein’s “Everyone”, and lots of other CK offerings, they are so so easy to pull off!
There’s not ONE single occasion where this fragrance would be outright horrible or weird. Even in freezing temperatures this smells decent, but just out of season.

I have several fragrances that outperforms CK Everyone, but one is superior for Christmas only, some for fall and winter, yet others for date nights and romantic events, and then you have the fresh and good citruses, but they are to intense, or contains certain notes that makes them inappropriate for office, dinner at your father in law or whatnot.
Because of this, I’d classify CK Everyone as a very easily wearable fragrance and for that reason alone I’ve ran halfway through a 100ml bottle in just 6 months. I reach for it on a regular basis and with good reason.

So, as I sad, haters gonna hate. This fragrance is not out of this world in any sense, but it’s a great dumb reach for 7 out of 10 occasions. To me I find myself in love with several of my fragrances, but still this one is the only bottle I got with a dent that grows in a pace where you can actually notice changes from one week to another.

It’s not at the level of Nishane Ani, the love of my life, nor is it as beautifully delicate as Dior Homme Intense or as fluffy and clean as JHAG Anyways. Still it’s the one whom I have to repurchase most frequently. That’s alone says a lot!",05/02/24 09:59,Ben&Jerry

It didn't, at least on my skin. Very forgettable, I could only feel citrus and small bit of tea on the opening and then it faded away in a matter of two hours, as if I applied nothing. Ironically, even EDT seemed to perform better on my skin? I only tried EDT at perfume stores, multiple times, but comparing them side by side made me feel like I lean much more towards EDT, which is kinda sad because I waited out for the EDP bottle release thinking it will be EDT on steroids. Shame, but it is what it is.

CK Everyone Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"My bottle of the EDT was running dry and as more of an EDP man I was quite excited for this. Sad to say I’m disappointed, I expected the base notes (or should I say note) to be more prevalent in the EDP but I didn’t realise it would be an entirely different base. The top-middle notes are where the EDT really shines but you really can’t smell much of the them in this. This is really quite bland.

Honestly I would skip but I’d recommend the EDT, it was a daily for me due to the fairly low price point and versatile scent. It’s suitable for spring, summer even warmer fall days. Most definitely for any gender but I personally think it leans feminine despite the consensus. This on the other hand definitely leans male.",05/29/23 11:08,Slydee

CK Everyone Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Not sure, perhaps there is something wrong with my old “sniffer” because I am not seeing (hating) what most people see here. I find it bright and crisp and fresh with some feeling of a tropical (not sweet) fruity vibe.To me it comes off as definitely unisex, perhaps leaning a bit more towards the guys but can equally be worn by all genders, hence “everyONE”. I find that it smells similar to other CK fragrances which makes it not very unique. But I’d hold off on saying that it’s generic. After reading and hearing all of the feedback about this EDP, I never, ever expected to like it like I do. As I said, maybe it’s by nose. “Everyone’s” (no pun intended) nose is different. It’s all subjective I believe.

CK Everyone Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Got this as a free sample sent to me so no clue about the price. Off the top, it does give a similar vibe to Acqua di Gio but that fades within like 30 minutes. I wouldn't go as far as to say it smells like an air freshener but I can see where that comes from. It is a pretty easy-to-wear, dumb reach fragrance that most if not all people will find pleasant but don't expect something complex that will evolve in an interesting manner. The longevity is moderate, I got about 4-5 hours on moisturized skin and ghost smells the day after. But it doesn't really project and sits rather close to the skin. On a positive note, it's not super harsh on the nose, I wouldn't say it smells extremely high quality but it's not crazy synthetic either. Leans masculine but can definitely be unisex or even a tad feminine depending on how it reacts with your skin.",04/24/22 20:58,juhuang2001
CK Everyone Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"This one is interesting. It smells like an abstract drawing of something like Acqua did Gio EdP. It's fresh, faintly aquatic, vaguely green or even almost ozonic. It doesn't go far in either of these directions though. It's kind of everything and nothing at the same time. A curious scent yet it doesn't really smell unique. You could do a lot worse than this but no one will be blown out of their minds either. It also doesn't last super long, similarly to the original EdT.",04/07/22 10:27,Candyandy
CK Everyone Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"This literally smells like a Glade air freshener. The EDT also has the same air freshener vibe as a note in the background. But this somehow manages to smell more like an air freshener than an actual air freshener, which would have some additional scent like flowers or vanilla. This is just the ozonic part of an air freshener in condensed form.

I definitely recommend this to people who want to smell like walking air fresheners! I bet this'll do a great job in covering up any trace of how you naturally smell. Which is very ironic for something advertised with individuality and naturalness.",04/07/22 08:12,santeripe

CK Everyone Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"I've only tried this once but I liked it, just as with the EDT it wasn't a 'love' at first sniff but I like it. Longevity was surprisingly good on my skin with two quick sprays. I find it paradoxically laughable but sad that CK fragrances get such a bad rap in 'fragcom'. Especially when there are such fine under the radar gems to be had such as Obsessed for men intense EDP and CK2.

For me this one isn't going to rank up alongside the two aforementioned scents and I don't think I'll buy a full bottle but that's mainly because I'm not so into this type of fresh 'green' scent. It's pretty good though and I liked it more the longer I wore it.",01/16/22 15:44,Dark Owl

Eternity Love Calvin Klein,"I was fortunate enough to stumble upon this fragrance recently, which was a limited edition flanker of Eternity, released more than 7 years ago. I own the original Eternity, and while I like its crisp, white freshness, it's nice to experience different takes on such a popular scent through its flankers.

Eternity Love is a very 'pink' fruity floral. It's not an overly unique composition, it's something that is easily in comparison to other fragrances, however it has a prettiness that I can't deny.

It opens with juicy orange, pink lotus and magnolia. At first it smelt a little bit like Lanvin's Rumeur 2 Rose, which I own in a shower gel. It has that clean fruitiness that is ever so present in shampoos and bath products. I found it quite uninspiring.

However, once settled, Eternity Love becomes more floral and sweet. The rose and peony stand out a lot, making this fragrance quite rosy and pleasantly tarty. At times it smells like a bouquet of pretty and delicate blooms. Very romantic and feminine.

Unfortunately this fragrance is extremely light and airy. It became almost non-existant on my skin which soaked it up in seconds. The lasting strength isn't particularly great either, just managing to last four hours. For the sake of this fragrance being rare, Eternity Love still has me captivated, however it's not something that has me overly thrilled. I would most likely recommend this fragrance for wear in Spring and Summer.",04/22/11 02:11,missk
Eternity Love Calvin Klein,"Nothing to write home about. For me it's not memorable, just a very mediocre fragrance, like a million other florals that I just would not find necessary to rave about. Well I still would not completely slam-dunk it. It's OK if you like ordinary.",09/06/10 12:54,Roma27
Eternity Love Calvin Klein,"CK ETERNITY LOVE is one of a plethora of flankers to the classic CK ETERNITY. I'm somewhat surprised at precisely how indistinct this composition is, given that Calvin Klein frags tend not to smell like anything but themselves!

ETERNITY LOVE edp is a gentle fruity floral which is neither too sweet nor too floral. The fruits and the flowers do not stand out as individual notes to my nose. ETERNITY LOVE smells nothing like ETERNITY, but it does smell a lot like many other frags. This is an inoffensive and even pleasant bouquet to be sure, but since I find it similar to about a dozen other fruity florals, I'll not make any effort to procure more.

ETERNITY LOVE has low sillage and is remarkably evanescent compared to its namesake, which is aptly named, for it does indeed last a veritable eternity. Perhaps this is a cynical statement about the mercurial quality of love?",07/21/10 11:05,sherapop

CK One Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"My review differs a little from the previous reviews. I really like this perfume.... I find it more masculine than feminine even though it is unisex, on my skin (feminine) it has an evolution very similar to a """" male” and I have to say that I find it fantastic.... different from the usual perfumes I wear (sometimes too feminine). It gives me the sensation of a fresh, aromatic fougere aftershave.... I can't wait to let my husband try it to hear what he thinks, seen from a male perspective... I wear it to feel fresh and invigorated, as if I had just finished taking a shower, in short it makes me feel really good! I think I'll buy it again, I'll stock up on it, my androgynous side makes itself felt thanks to this delicious summer perfume, the only flaw if we want the duration, it doesn't last on me for more than 3-4 hours... too bad, it means that I will spray it several times throughout the day, its hint of lime pepper and maybe a light cucumber are wonderful as far as I'm concerned.",01/28/24 08:59,Ariete76

I buy the latest and greatest bottle each and every Summer.

Sadly, 2017 is the ONLY CK One Summer flanker that I did not like. Basically, I detect sour cucumbers when this one hits my skin...no fun...no refreshing blasts of citrus, no aromatic or aquatic tones...just shame and stench. Sad, but true!

CK One Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"I work full time, 12 (more like 15+) hour shifts as an RN (registered nurse). I wear scents that smell clean, fresh, and feminine, but nothing too floral or sweet as it turns my patients’ stomachs.

CK One Summer (‘17) is perfect for work. As it settles, it has that CK base of musk and a slight woody note, but in this version, it’s soft and blends nicely with the other notes to keep it fresh and summery. I never overdo it - just enough to smell clean.

Longevity - I can still smell remnants of it at the end of my shifts. Sillage is not as long lasting but my patients comment on it when I’m close completing my assessments. They like it - none have ever shared it makes them nauseated as what I first wore when I started as a new grad and wore strong sweet florals. I think it because it’s close to what clean linens would smell like after they’ve been on the clothesline by a salty ocean.

I can see this being a good one to spray on when it’s just skin-to-skin, right before an intimate moment, because it’s so clean but it’s got that wood-musk base. I’ll let you know if I ever find a date - lol - I think maybe I’m working too much but I digress 😁",07/03/19 02:00,Petals_and_Perfumes
CK One Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"It makes me die of laughter. It seems to scream ""cucumber"" from all sides. Cucumber covering all other notes, maybe only the file manages to re-emerge. If it was a person, this scent would be just a clumsy clown that makes jokes and games with cucumbers (believe me, I'm bursting out laughing while I write it.) Where is the saffron? Where is the pepper?
I do not know, but if something makes me laugh it's because I like it (its meaning but not the fragrance) then promoted but rejected.",10/24/18 06:27,giuseppe98gp83
CK One Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,This one is really cloying and I bought it before I knew much about fragrances. It is very sweet with a peppery background which makes it very shallow. I paid way too much for it and will never wear it again.,07/23/18 10:33,Fragro

CK One Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"I love Ck One and it's flankers, but this one smells very unpleasant on my skin. I just smell pepper and a little bit of cucumber. I like using unisex or even male fragrances, but due to the harsh pepper note I find this fragrance super masculine.

The bottle looks awesome though and longevity is really good. I wanted to get rid of the smell and washed my wrist with soap and could still smell the pepper!

I am looking forward to Ck One Summer 2018. Hopefully it is something coconutty!",12/28/17 03:25,running_girl
CK One Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"I got it this by my dear friend yesterday.

Citrusy in a bottle :)
It's fresh, casual everyday, summer scent.

Main composition is citrus, lime and lemon, its linear and stays that way. The whole character of this fragrance is citrusy. You get very synthetic lemony lime vibe.
Cucumber is not existent, maybe the first 2 minutes at the beginning, but than completely gone. There is not even a slight resemblance to Polo Blue or Eternity Aqua, None!

I find it very, Very similar to Tommy Hilfiger Jeans for him.
The longevity and sillage is medium to soft.
I like it for everyday summer use and the bottle is great, sunny rays across.",07/20/17 04:50,ProtonN
CK One Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"I quite like it, the most masculine of all editions I can think of, very strong in the cucumber department, fair longevity, not much sweetness, but nice.",07/10/17 05:56,Coffee King
CK One Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"I purchased the 2017 edition of the ck One summer edition for myself but more so for my girlfriend. I wore it a few times before giving it to her formally since I have too many. I'll leave this in my collection because it is at her apartment. This is my longer form review after she has used it as well.

I get a peppery unisex Ralph Lauren Polo Blue/Calvin Klein Eternity Aqua for Men with this. Lots of cucumber and pepper in this but not much else at all. That said, those are notes I do like. I think it is a bit better on women than men honestly, especially with the pricing. Women wear it bit better, especially my girlfriend. It is good while it lasts about 4/5 hours tops similar to most accounts of the modern Polo Blue and maybe CK Eternity Aqua for Men if you can't carry it. This is man or women and it is a light summer scent. If you want a more peppery take on Eternity Aqua (for Men) go with CK One Summer 2017 men. Ladies, go with this for a summer option that isn't overtly tropical or overly sweet.

Other than the length, I think the main issue is the retail pricing. I got it for less than half of Kohl's $54USD for 100 ml and honestly, I wouldn't pay much more than $30USD for it. Now I think I've seen it in Ross now for a bit less. I say this as the CK One Summer scents often have similar box designs so I wasn't sure but my girlfriend thinks it was. Whatever CK One Summer scents I saw in Ross were $19.99 USD for 100 ml. So if this box design is what you see, get it for that price and don't think twice.

Rating wise, I can't give it good for men, maybe 6.8 out of 10 for a bit common scent. Especially considering Calvin Klein has Eternity Aqua for men for a lower price. I do like it though. For women, I think a 7.5 is in order as to me it seems a bit more unique though not strong performing. It smells great on my girlfriend but just OK on me due to the obvious similar scents.",07/05/17 00:47,mkpunk

CK One Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"Meh, when did this line become so synthetic? I know, someone might say “since forever!” but it seems to me it used to be a kinder, friendlier synthetic. I still have some of 2011 left, and it smells as it’s supposed to, whereas in 2016, and now 2017, some harsh chemical dominates so completely as to make notes irrelevant. 2016 smelled 95% like window cleaner and 5% like juniper, and this one is the same, except the 5% is cucumber. Too bad, because it’s a lovely cucumber, and the bottle is gorgeous.

Still, if you liked 2016 (and don’t hate cucumber), you might enjoy this one as well.",06/18/17 06:51,aquarius_moon
CK One Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"This is already hitting the shelves at discount stores in the US. Picked up mine for $19.99 at Ross. Similar to the 2015 version, but not as syrupy sweet. I'm not getting the cucumber or ""pepper trio"" accord at all though. First spray actually reminded me more or Dior Homme Sport 2012. Big blast of citrus and what feels like ginger to me, but maybe that's the saffron and pepper. Thr Dior-ness fades away pretty quickly, leaving your skin smelling like a boat drink. That isn't necessarily a bad thing :)

It's as non-offensive as all the others and slightly more versatile than previous years. If you can't find it at a heavy discount yet, give it 30 days or so. By July of last year, Kohl's had already marked down the 2016 version to about $13.",06/15/17 08:49,foreignshores

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"I blind bought this having really high expectations. I love a good fresh coconut scent which I thought this was gonna be since its being compared to JPG le beau and others. Its not bad but its definitely not your typical coconut freshie. As some one else mentioned there's a liquorice type of scent in the background which I'm not that fond of. It's a lot sweeter than CK aromatic essence and not at all alike. Still it's a good and rather unique scent for summer if you don't wanna smell like everyone else with their JPG.
I'm going to try another coconut scent perfume and if that doesn't do it for me then either a dupe of jpg le beau or Ill just stick to a straight up coconut scent. This scent is pretty close to Lattafas badee al oud honor and glory but lattafas is much better in my opinion.

In conclusion it's an okay scent, a little overpriced because you now that CK frags don't last that long. It's best at its dry down which becomes a skin scent only . At least it wasn't a total failure.",03/28/25 08:41,Glassmoon

Milky coconut builds up mid with mild cedar adding tasteful dryness. Star fruit brings unique sweetness. Ultimately uses coconut in the way fragrances use wood, which is curious and impressive.

Side note: This fragrance was used as a part of a pop art exhibit in 2015 - Sylvie Fleury created a large green neon sign ""ETERNITY NOW"" in the brand's font and everything, to sit atop the Bass Art Museum in Miami.

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"Late to the game, I got this recently on a pretty good deal: $25 for 100ml, which turns out to be just fair.

It's a very smooth and enjoyable scent all the way through from the very opening. Tonka, vanilla, coconut is the overall theme with ginger, cedar and patchouli around the edges. I'm not sure I can tell there's star fruit in here, but there's a sort of freshness that tames this otherwise crazy sweet scent along with the help of cedar both in the heart and in the base. I think it's safe to say that the scent itself doesn't evolve much and stays somewhat linear. Longevity and sillage are only slightly better than your average CK due to the amped up sweet notes that push out.

This is by no means a formal scent--this is the kind you put on when you're going out for a brunch or meeting friends for a drink. I'd categorize this as a cool-weather scent, so pretty much good to wear anytime in the spring and fall, and fine for cooler summer evenings, but I don't necessarily put this on in the dead heat of the summer as I'd imagine the sweetness would overwhelm me, and others around as much as they can smell this.

Lastly, I have to say there's a certain elegance to the ultimately simple bottle presentation. I have a feeling that the round edges mimic the smoothness of the scent itself, and the color of the juice resembles its vibe.

All in all, I think it's a worthwhile buy at the heavily discounted price, but will I buy another bottle? Perhaps; I'll see if I can find something better in the same category when this runs out. Also a side note, my bottle is made in the US.",05/04/22 13:59,kalilax

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"This has got to be one of the most puzzling juices I have ever had.

Step 1: Tested on my wrist. I was extremely disappointed to find that the coconut smelled very synthetic: coconut was a major reason why I had wanted this perfume. On the wrist it smelled more and more disgusting with every hour, though I realized that could be because of unintended mixing with other smells.

Step 2: Tested on a piece of cloth. OK at first, nausea-inducing after a while.

Step 3: Wore it in real life conditions, under the arm and around the neck. To my surprise it felt considerably better than in steps 2 and 3. I applied it late morning and went out spending hours outside under conditions that were both humid and rainy. The fragrance held up well under such conditions.

Longevity was weak; at the end of the day it was smelling vaguely like incense.

So after all those tests I still can't figure out whether it was a good frag or not. I am probably more disappointed than pleased with it. I had the chance to get Eternity Flame for cheaper, maybe should have given it a go despite negative reviews.

Within the CK catalogue the Euphoria collection probably suits me more than Eternity, at least based on samples I tried in-store.

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"Personally, I don't think it's that Arabic.

The blurb for this product said it was an 'Oriental' fougère fragrance for men, with exotic woods. I get a rather unique summery creamy coconut-y vibe from it than the 'oriental' whatever they advertised. If this is indeed an 'oriental' fragrance, then it is one that I can somehow tolerate.

What I get is this: a layer of coconut and vanilla over a very strong tonka bean base.

Normally, I'm indifferent to coconut (as a scent - I like to eat them though) and I hate vanilla and tonka beans. HOWEVER, somehow in this fragrance, those notes blend together well enough that I don't mind smelling it. Nevertheless, I would still not be getting a bottle of it - it's just ok for me. I don't mind smelling it on people, and I don't mind wearing the remaining bits of the sample I have left on myself occasionally (if I'm in the mood), but I don't see myself liking it to the extent I'd get a bottle. If I get it as a gift, sure, I'd not mind keeping it, but I won't be spending money on it.

To sum up, if you expect a full-blown 'oriental' fragrance, you'll be sorely disappointed. (I'm glad it didn't smell like that but whatever.) Instead, expect a summery coconut-y creamy fragrance from this one.",02/13/22 13:32,washudtoj

Okay...Definitely smells better after the initial ""nuclear-alcohol-blast"" spray dries-up some. That made my eyes water...yeesh. Now that it's dried down and the alcohol has mellowed out...I can smell more flavors in this...though none are specifically ""Coconut"".
(15 mins later...)
Okay, now this smells like what I was expecting...soft, creamy vanilla smelling with a hint of woodiness and a hint of CK-ONE DNA in the background...and I think I can just barely smell a hint of coconut in there. BUT then again, this was a napkin test.
Ah well...I will wear it on skin when I go out tonight and update after I return home...

UPDATE: (0000)
Just getting back in. Applied ""NOW"" to body and shirt earlier around 1832.
3 shots on chest, one on each side of neck and rear of neck, two on shirt-front.
Left the house smelling like nothing I have ever smelled before...
This fragrance smells AMAZING on skin!! Oh...My...Goodness...
This was the first time that I have loaded up on sprays and my wife did not complain the whole time we were out! No complaints, but also no compliments from anyone...but that could be because she was with me. I'll see how it does in the morning.
The body sprays faded after about 4 hours...around 2200, and the shirt sprays lasted still!! They're STILL smellable (to me) from about a foot away....amazing! Now that I know it lasts longer on my clothes than it does on my skin, I can load up my shirt with it and spray something else that lasts longer on my skin...

16SEP21
Layered this with two shots of ""Bentley - Azure"" today. I sprayed about 10 shots of ""NOW"" all over...neck...chest...shirt. And nothing...
Nothing when I went out for breakfast, nothing at work, nothing when I went out for lunch but by that time i couldn't even smell it anymore.

Now I know why my wife didn't have a reaction to this cologne...there is ZERO projection!
Usually when I go out, I either turn heads because they get gassed out by my cologne, or I turn heads because someone likes my fragrance and asks me what I'm wearing.
But with this weaksauce...no reaction anywhere from anyone. Now I understand why this frag has such a low rating....no one can smell this cologne!
I think I have this cologne backwards...it's not something you use as a featured scent...IT is the base layer and you put something better on top of it. So I had my mixture backwards this morning, I should have used this stuff as a base layer and put something else on top of it!! Welp, I guess I don't need a second bottle of this...it's not a winner. This would be in the donation bin or given to my son if I knew of a better ""Coconut"" fragrance... =[

UPDATE: WOO+!!! Layered this today and got a compliment from the wife!! I base-layered my chest and upper arms with ""Oxford Bleu"", then shot about 5-6 sprays on my shirt of ""NOW"" and one shot of ""Himalaya"" behind each ear. She said I smelled like a pina colada...lol. PERFECT!! Also got a compliment at the gas station this morning.
No scent remaining 2 hours after I arrived at work...all left is the Oxford Bleu and Himalaya. This gets put in the backup bin...there has to be a better coconut fragrance than this ""Hide-and-go-seek"" mess...

NOTE: This fragrance WILL stain on light colors...but they will disappear after washing.",09/15/21 10:10,Detman101
Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"Believe it or not, this is not only my cheapest fragrances but also one of my most complimented. The coconut in the opening is excellent and the dry down with vanilla and tonka bean is to die for. Such a smooth, sweet, and somehow both cozy and playful scent that has good projection and decent longevity. I also think this is a very versatile scent that is for both night and day as well as every season except potentially winter depending on your personal preference.

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"Eternity Now for Men is yet another Eternity for Men flanker from Calvin Klein that is mis-marketed. I don't see this as a ""now"" fragrance similar to Tommy Now. What is it with ""now"" fragrances not being current? Now don't get me wrong, I don't hate it. I know people dunked on this, but I cannot. Well other than it being CK release and the typical CK fragrance performance issues. IMHO, if you ignore the performance issues, most CKs are good releases and some have good performance and are good releases (Reveal Men, Euphoria Gold Men.)

Eternity Now is very much a tropical Virgin Island cologne smell. I wore it this morning and honestly I got an alcoholic smell to it that I previously didn't detect. It is a bit rubbing alcohol, but due to the tropical notes, it comes off like a mojito or maybe a pina colada as it settles on the skin. I think the coconut gives it the tropical cocktail feel to the initial rubbing alcohol blast. There is a spice from the anise and the ginger too. From there, you get some starfruit and a little cedar in the mid. The base is very vanillic and somewhat tonka beany. I say that since by this point, you need a summer breeze to really carry the scent to your nose.

Eternity Now is very much a spring and summer scent, though with the spice you could pull it off for fall. I think Eternity Now is a casual and vacation scent. Due to the alcoholic vibe, I think you shouldn't wear it at work. Eternity Now will get you about 4/5 hours. Maybe 6 if you are lucky.

Eternity Now for Men I got on the back of the two Eternity Summer for Men releases I got (2019 and 2020) and I really think this should have been a Eternity Summer release more so than its own release. I think it got unnecessary dislike but it isn't a great fragrance. I say Eternity Now for Men is a solid 7 out of 10 like Eternity Summer for Men 2019, because of the uniqueness, even if I do love the smell of Eternity Summer for Men 2019 better.",06/21/21 22:07,mkpunk
Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"Amazing cologne and my signature scent of 2020, wore through two bottles in a year and never failed to reach for it, appropriate for any occasion and any season. Don't let the negative reviews stop you from smelling this yourself, in my experience Eternity Now has been a compliment monster. Coconut, Ginger and Starfruit dominate this fragrance creating a strong, manly smelling tropical scent that is irresistible to women. I compare it to Virgin Island water as the non alcoholic more effervescent counterpart to VIW.",06/09/21 23:12,Captaintanner81
Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"I really didn't think i was going to like this when i bought it. It was just a blind buy after something else was surprisingly cheaper. Its around 23C today and currently wearing this inside as a work scent. And I really like it on a summers day with its coconut opening. This is a very very pleasant smell. Its not sweet but definitely spicy gourmand. A discerning partner would think you are edible.

This is not for the flashy extroverts. Its not a statement scent. Its just very much a very workmanlike summer scent. I didn't get Eternity in the 90s, but i can see why the buzz was there now. It reminds me a tad of Versace Dreamer, which is a lot more flamboyant.",06/02/21 05:28,sameenuk
Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"Just got this yesterday and I legit don’t understand how some people can call this a “meh” flanker or just overall mediocre. It’s smells smooth and relaxed; it has a great trifecta of sweet, tropical, and creamy but with a manly twist. It’s honestly—now—my go-to for these hot summer days. It makes the day feel and smell like a beach day or a vacation. I’m not much of a “sweet & creamy” scent kinda guy. The only creamy scent I’ve ever liked is the Chanel Allure Homme but THIS, this is creamy tropical coconut magic!

I HIGHLY recommend you blind buy this if you fuck with coconut.

Scent: 9/10 (the coconut 🤌🏼)

Longevity: 4-6 hours

Lasts 1-2 hours during a sweaty workout if you’re looking to smell good at the gym and after the gym.

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,This fragrance has a pleasant coconut note without smelling too much like suntan lotion. It also has a nice musky smell on my skin.,05/05/21 07:25,timotomate
Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"This is a very fresh coconut and vanilla scent creamy and light, nothing really heavy or to gourmand. The dry down makes it even better as the cedar and patchouli kick in. I didn't get much star fruit as I do with st. Kitts by Tommy Bahama. This is great for a warm spring/summer's evening. Great smell and vibe for a function or venue will get you compliments. Sillage was great for about 4-5 hours while I was out. After that skin and you can still smell it radiating. I smelled it well into this morning on my skin. This is actually a great blind buy, especially if you don't want to be grouped in the usual summer citrus juices. As always! Try it for yourself, everyone has different DNA!!!",04/26/21 07:36,Xzotic Smells
Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"Coconut with a light, creamy vanilla. Warm, mildly spiced, yet tropical. Don't expect suntan lotion. This is not as heavy, and slightly more elegant than that.

Tip: You want to feel like a walking summer vacation or pina colada for a good six hours? Layer this on top of freshly applied cocoa butter/ coconut lotion. It enhances the scent and makes it last a solid 3/4th's a day.

Good for summer days. Even better for summer nights. I enjoy it.

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"Like ""mikestro"" skillfully wrote below, here the coconut vanilla blend is warm and spicy. The woody aspect of the scent is subdued but present throughout it's life. I find Eternity Now an innovative but coherent and probably the most successful entry in the Eternity line, considering the likes of Aqua, Air, or the summer editions.

I use this fragrance in the spring and summer, day or night, I find it's performance to be astoundingly good, where you get at least 4 hours of moderate projection and at least 12 hours as a skin scent. I also use this perfume during the winter doldrums after the shower as a reminder of the better times to come.

I wholeheartedly can recommend this perfume to all those lazy sunbathers who are into coconut fragrances, but desire a warm, woody, manly twist into it.",03/30/21 14:53,sapeur1999

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,This one is a really nice tropical sweet vanilla scent. I love wearing it,03/18/21 20:47,adamh9201
Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"I would consider this a gourmand of sorts because of the warm, sweet milky coconut; the vanilla, tonka bean and the licorice-y spiciness coming from the star anise. i don't really smell any fruitiness from the star fruit as listed in the note breakdown here on fragrantica.

I really like this scent, I've never smelled coconut done like this. This to me is not a tropical, bright summery coconut but a darker, lightly spiced coconut whose scent evokes more of a late spring early fall vibe.

I can't see this being a dead of summer scent, its too cozy smelling. Another facet of this scent I'm really digging is the subtle but noticeable patchouli in the late drydown; this earthy facet augments the warm spiced feel of this fragrance.

Lastly, is the performance. i give this a 6 out of 10. i get decent performance from this, about 6 hrs and probably 2 or 3 good hrs of projection. All the people who are saying the longevity is terrible, i dont know what to say, i have really oily skin to start with and i moisturize the areas i apply fragrance to. I rarely find a fragrance - including the cheapies - that i dont get a minimum of 4 to 5 hours of longevity.

I am not wowed by this fragrance but it is a strong like. its great layered with fruity fragrances for a brighter more tropical vibe.",10/19/20 18:58,mikestro
Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"I love this scent. It is magical and reminds me of my childhood. It is sweet like cotton candy at first glance, then dries down to a sugary lemon. It is a gourmand frag for sure. There is a drink called a ""chocolate cake"" where after you take the shot, you bite into a lemon covered in sugar and it tastes almost exactly like chocolate cake. This stuff smells just like the first second you taste the cake in it. The bad side is that it doesn't last for more than 2 hours. I use this as a bedtime frag to cover up the disgusting smell I make from being an alcoholic. 2 sprays and my gal thinks I sprayed on Christian Audiger's 1958 and not sank 1/2 a bottle of rum.

Yes it might be generic, that's not always a bad thing tho'..I think it's fresh easy going and shouldn't offend many ppl. A really nice summer/spring frag for me and I'm a bit surprised that it hasn't recieved more love. My first 30ml bottle is almost done for so I'm currently ordering a new 100ml. For the price I found online I will be paying 300 sek for 100 ml, it's about $32..and for that price this frag is an absolute no brainer in my book!

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"Smells great for the first 30 minutes and I’m not joking, but within 45 minutes it’s a skin scent. I bought this at a department store, checked the batch codes and this is legit. Judging from the moderate longevity scores I am going to assume that there was a major reformulation because the performance in this sucks really really bad, this falls into the poor performance catergory on here. To test if this was a skin issue for me I lent the bottle out to 2 other friends and both said the same thing. The coconut nectar and ginger in this one are just beautiful. I am not impressed and a little salty because of the waste of money on this one. Even some Zara scents I have outperform this one. This is below average to me. Save your money.

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"Summery, fresh, exotic, and sweet!

Opening: Fun and sweet with noticeable tonka bean. Sweetness will get you noticed and complimented, a very youthful type of sweetness- not gourmand.

Middle: Sweetness dries down to reveal very prominent woody note

End: Minimal Sweetness with a synthetic boring woody note.

Performance: Projects strongly for a solid 1-2 hours depending on skin but then sits close to skin for a sensual and fun drydown. Ultimately, performance will depend on your skin type.

OVERALL: 8/10 This is for those who tire of constantly smelling spicy and dark men's fragrances. It is fun and youthful with a ""night on the town"" type vibe. Recommended for all ages looking to add variety to their collection.",06/27/19 12:46,FragranceTester9292

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"I really like it. It's my favorite Calvin Klein flanker. Coconut and vanilla that thankfully avoids being suntan lotion. It is sweet but my chemistry somehow tones down sweet scents so I can enjoy it but others may not. You know, when to wear it is a good question. It is probably too sweet to wear out in the heat (summer) yet with the coconut that's exactly when it should be worn. So, I'd say wear it in the summer when you expect to be indoors most of the time. Works where I'm at (the South) because as much as we all like to talk about being outside during the summer down here, the truth is many, many Southerners spend the ungodly hot summers in the A/C. If I'm outside I'll be on the jet ski or in the lake and won't bother with fragrance anyways. So there you go. It's an indoors summer scent. Or, a summer night scent depending on the heat.",08/27/18 14:41,Tigidy101
Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"To describe this perfume as an oriental is to stretch that word to the limit.
This is an oriental for millenials, a likable water down version. Having grown in the 80's, I still have memories of cloying car rides where the likes of Opium reigned.
Still, Eternity Now is attractive, mellow and soft, feels like suede. Comforting and not intrusive.
The coconut nectar ( whatever that might be) is the main character, some flimsy bare noticeable citrus note lingers for a few minutes. Then is Woody, clean.

If I were to compare it beyond 1 Million, it would be to Chanel's Egoiste Platinum, that too was supposed to be a scent I would love but whatever is causing the brassiness is in it as well.

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"This is a really peculiar gourmand scent, the opening is amazingly unique and in fairness that’s true of many Calvin Klein fragrances, they open well but then become less obscure, more familiar and uninspiring. I can only attribute this to the fruity opening of star fruit, another thing CK tend to do is use unusual fruits in the top notes, normally I’d say they smell a bit like apple or tangerine or grapefruit but they usually smell very much different to normal fruits which is a nice attention to detail and leads me to conclude they really do resemble the exotic and rarer fruits. I have actually had a star fruit before but I can’t remember what it was like? Anyway then comes a powerful and almost niche sweetness which is already building a big Tonka Bean and vanilla base. As it delveops the candy floss sweetness and a very nice coconut note which isn’t ridiculous and sun lotion like, I’d say more dark, remind me of Only the Brave WILD a fragrance I thought was cheap and throwaway but actually, strangely enjoyed. It starts to loose itself in the drydown becoming more generic and annoying Tonka based, overly busy, messy stuff. When it settles to a very low skin scent after several hours is just a sweet Rochas Man but not as charming or subtle. I actually thought I’d buy this for the over sweet and unique opening alone but as the notes developed the composition just became more and more jumbled",04/24/18 16:04,Houdini4
Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"It's good, but painfully mild. It smells mostly like that Tahitian Treat/Tahiti Treat fruit punch soft drink. Get for cheap! I paid $24.99 for a 50ml and I think that was too much! lol Also, to be a(true) flanker, you'd think this would bare 1% at least resemblance to the Original Eternity. Maybe worthy of a class-action lawsuit! ;)",02/24/18 18:59,lespritz.1
Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"Eternity now definitely shocked me but not with how good it smells but for how it smells. With coconut listed I was expecting something along the lines of Tommy Bahama or even something similar to the CK One Summers.

Unfortunately this is just another sweet but fresh,bubble-gummy type of smells along the lines of One Million,Polo Red, and Eros. ( I’m so sick of this genre)

This does add a different take as the coconut and star fruit make it unique,and I liked what they did with this scent but it’s to immature and sugary sweet for my taste. However, I’m not going to say this is a bad scent but it’s personally not for me !

On my skin this smelled very similar to a girly Pina colada air freshener 1 of my exes used to have in her car.lol

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"Wow, this is actually quite nice. I was quite expecting to hate it, but I wore the original back in the early 90s.

Starts off overwhelmingly sweet and gourmand and coconuts everywhere, but eventually starts to morph and adopt some of the more classic lavender/vanilla of the fougère original...although no idea where the lavender note comes from - a combo of other things? This is an admittedly modern, sickly sweet fougère but a fougère nonetheless - and quite well put together, or even dare I say it 'balanced', in the notes somehow, despite being so sweet and coconutty.

Important to note, this fougère development happened to me on a test strip after two hours, so on skin I'm sure it would happen quicker, and might be why many turn their noses up so soon if testing on paper.)

I'm not sure I'd wear it now, though I'm sure young men would love it.",11/13/17 08:26,Jareth
Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,This fragrance has a brilliant and unique opening owed to the carambola (star fruit).

Quite disappointed.,10/26/17 22:14,kingc01
Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"My husband probably accidentally bought this one instead of Eternity which he bought for years, until I asked him to try something else, because he was wearing Eternity at a time when everyone else was wearing it all the time too and I just grew tired of being surrounded by Eternity for Men.

I'm glad he accidentally bought this fragrance, because I love orientals, Eternity Now has Tonka, vanilla, cedar and coconut, which are all notes I love. The fruity notes aren't detectable on my husband or maybe they evaporated immediately, because he applies it at the same time as his aftershave, right out of the shower, in a steamy bathroom.

Eternity Now seems like it's best for cooler weather, but knowing hub, he won't stop wearing it until the bottle's empty, even if if lasts him into next Summer *sigh!*.

It's masculine and not in a heavy overbearing way, though with so many people being fragrance phobic today, I'm sure someone at a family gathering or work will complain.:(

Hub just sprayed it on before driving out to a buddy's HAM shack, so I can't say anything about longevity. If the other HAMS don't lilke the fragrance, then hub might be able to get a radio and computer all to himself.:D

While hub didn't put any thought into this purchase and just grabbed what he thought was the only Eternity out there (I don't think he's noticed flankers and wouldn't understand the term) for me, this is a win and the first men's fragrance from Calvin Klein, that I've liked for years!:)",09/24/17 03:30,WildViolet76

I was about to finish up my sample and for the first time I used it in the morning right after my shower. Well 7 hours later I was still smelling it. Put on later in the day it didn't last, but when I put it on early, it stayed with me.

bought it!!!",03/11/17 22:41,avaloncm

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"I have to admit I'm quite attracted to this fragrance. There's nothing cheap about it except for the price tag. To me, the scent and the packaging are both great. My husband got it last year and it has become his new signature since then..I really love the smell whenever he wears it and I just can't stop smelling him when he's wearing it..

Unlike me, he isn't a perfume snob or a perfume collector, he doesn't care for expensive fragrances and only likes to own one cologne/scent at a time. That's just the opposite of me, which I find it pretty adorable. On the day we picked up this fragrance, I smelt tones of other male fragrances, only this one got my immediate attention. Because to me it smelt fun, modern, unique and sweet. It's a sweet masculine scent with some fresh tropical notes in the background. It smells like vanilla with star fruit and coconut. The notes are quite balanced in my opinion. The great thing is he likes it, too. He was going to get his old time favorite, Eternity Summer, but we were glad to come across this one instead.

I'm not very attracted to something too spicy or citrusy nowadays. In the gym, on the train or in the shopping centres, I'm just not a fan of those in your face citrusy male scents or super spicy stuff. Too me some male frag can even smell sharp or dated.This one is subtle, fresh, sweet and creamy. The opening is quite nice and strong. It projects well for a good 3-4 hours and then becomes a light skin scent.

Overall, I really like it and after half of the bottle it's still going strong. I haven't had enough of it yet, so I hope he might get another bottle of it once he finishes this one. ;)

By the way, he recently gifted me a 50ml CK Euphoria which looks lovely next to his 100ml Eternity Now. Unfortunately Eternity Now for Women doesn't work for me, too floral and sharp. But Euphoria is a total different story. Although I was never interested in it before, now I own it I think it's such a classic and sexy fragrance which shouldn't be ignored by me all these years.",01/27/17 20:37,Vampiris
Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"Years on and almost everything smells so much alike. Anything related to Eternity is barely detectable, perhaps a faint citric note in the begining. But in the end I get a less sweet, less cloying, and a better, in general, Burberry Brit Rhythm. Impressions are not always the same, and can change. It was fresher on paper strip.",12/15/16 07:18,periquito89

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"I agree with those who view this as unisex. If you like sweet gourmands I think you'll enjoy the first half hour or so. After that it doesn't seem to be as complex, which isn't uncommon, but I also begin to pick up a ""chemical"" quality, though it's not that strong (unlike some other recent CK scents I've tried). It comes across as a ""synthetic"" wood note. I don't understand why some ""cheapo"" companies can avoid this and yet still have good longevity (for example, Insurrection Wild II or whatever that Pure Havane type scent is called), but CK can't. Do they want this as their ""house note"" or are they too lazy to formulate properly, or is it just the cheapest way to go? Anyway, it goes in a cherry pipe tobacco direction, but it feels like the sweetness prevents that from ever developing, if that makes sense. A woman who thinks Pure Havane is too masculine might like this one. Perhaps I've just sampled too many of these and my standards have been raised substantially, but it's not a ""bad"" scent if you are seeking this sort of thing. I am, but I've already got ones I prefer. I'm not sure if I'll keep my 1 ounce bottle or swap it, but I'm leaning towards the latter. Note that I got none of original Eternity for Men here, though of course they share some ingredients, as is the case for 99% of other ""masculine"" designers.

UPDATE: That wood-ish note lasted more than 24 hours, but it's a bit screechy, probably because all the other notes were gone. Again, why load up a scent with such an irritating aroma chemical in a composition like this? I would have liked it without this harsh note - ""addition by subtraction"" is a lesson they apparently need to learn!",05/30/16 18:36,Bigsly
Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"CK can do better if just rename this to CK Now, nothing resembles the Eternity. It started with dusty citrus for 10 min, it evolve to strong powderish tonka-patchoulli scent for hours later. Projection is good, silliage is weak, stay close to your skin.

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"I ran into this new Calvin Klein Eternity Now at Sephora so I sprayed some on the tester strip to see what it is all about.. This is just my first impression of this fragrance.. Eternity Now opens up very fresh & fruity! The coconut is noticeable immediately and it is one of the prominent notes in this fragrance.. The star fruit adds a nice fruity touch which together with the coconut gives Eternity Now a bit of a tropical vibe.. As the fragrance progresses the scent begins to warm up a bit & get sweeter.. In the dry down notes of tonka & vanilla begin to take over.. Eternity Now is fresh, fruity, & somewhat sweet.. It is a very pleasant scent, although it does smell a bit synthetic but that is the usual for Calvin Klein fragrances.. I detect a bit of a similarity to Yves Saint Laurent's new Kouros Silver.. Eternity Now is a bit more fresh fruity & tropical whereas Kouros Silver is a bit warmer, & woodier but nevertheless the two share a similar vibe..",02/09/16 16:02,dolcethadon

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"Have you ever smelled a fragrance and thought to yourself, ""Now THIS would be MY SIGNATURE scent... if only I didn't have lots of other fragrances!""

That's how I feel about CK Eternity Now. If I didn't have 60 other fragrances, this would be my signature scent.

Something about it is so familiar but it's wholly unique for a men's fragrance. It's sweet, uniquely fresh, and clean. When I wear it, I feel confident and approachable. I feel friendly and inviting without being inappropriate or trying too hard.

It's very sweet, but it's fresh. It smells like a shampoo or hair conditioner but doesn't smell ""soapy"" which is a good thing. It's completely linear with this coconut nectar note being the dominating accord. This coconut nectar is the scent of the juice and not the flesh. A woman could easily wear this thing, it's that versatile. It's an every season type of fragrance. The vanilla cuts through arctic air of winter and the coconut nectar keeps things fruity and light in the summer.

I highly recommend this. Some days I wish for simpler times when I only had 1 or 2 fragrances. If I still lived in those times, Eternity Now for men would definitely be 1 of those 2 fragrances.",01/18/16 06:02,LolitoLempicko

Eternity Now For Men Calvin Klein,"Indeed a cozy warm and casual scent that combines the epic notes of Paco Rabannes 1 million and YSL la unit de l'homme. A whole other take on the Eternity line with their yearly summer edition and several flankers.

In the latter years CK have not dropped their defences and tried something new and avant garde and some of the recent newbies like Reveal is somewhat a scent that doesn't matter to most people.

As a scent it is good for winter and late autumn and the longevity is above average.

Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"CLEAN (TROPICAL) & FRESH - Neroli & Peach-Blossom. Opens with a burst of quince sorbet supported by litchi with the granular texture of sorbet. That deepens into the neroli heart with clean facets rounded out by peony & peach-blossom bringing a velvety peachy feel, resting on a floral support base of cashmere-woods, ambroxan & musk. Neroli here is more forward than the notes would suggest, and to my nose this is overall a neroli & peach-blossom scent, which come very close to evoking an orange-blossom. Performance is average or slightly above average for a light summer wearing experience. Overall: clean & fresh tropical/peachy neroli & peach-blossom scent. It's a love for me. Enjoy!

Contrast to Burberry Brit Sheer 2015:
These are different, but similarities with peach-blossom and a fluffy-musky floral-fruity. Burberry Brit Sheer 2015 has a more forward pineapple note. Eternity Now had stronger performance initially, but now they're roughly equivalent.

Contrast to Island Hawaii Michael Kors:
These are different, but there's similarities with the clean, orange-peachy floral. Island Hawaii has a more forward clementine-orange and orange-blossom instead of neroli. Eternity Now has better performance.

Contrast to Quatre Boucheron:
These are different, but there's a similar vibe with clean fluffy-musky floral-fruity. Quatre is louder, bolder with a more distinct jasmine note. Quatre has stronger performance.

Update 05/25/25: I'm noticing something more salty-musky in this today which may be the musk-cashmeran. Because of this it's reminding me of the Olympéa range today, specifically Olympéa Aqua & Olympéa Aqua EDP Légère although it's not a dupe. Still the delightful fluffy, clean floral-fruity vibe in the top. Love it.",07/25/23 07:42,suzanne_ronald

Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"ASSISTANCE REQUIRED:
I blind bought the lotion because I love peonies and hoped that would shine through. It's slightly too fruity or too something, I'm not sure what. Can anyone suggest what perfume to wear on top of this if one doesn't own the actual CK perfume? I looked to see what ""this perfume reminds me of"" and I don't have any of those perfumes listed. Don't get me wrong, it's a very lovely scent and though I can't see myself buying the actual perfume itself unless it was dirt cheap, it seems like a safe blind buy. I'd like to wear something on top that compliments it and doesn't clash while also not highlighting whatever that ""too muchness"" is lol
Any suggestions welcome!
Edit - I do really like this.. I think the too muchness is the fruit. Something sweet. Might work best for summertime, bet it would be delicious in June/July/Aug, but it's middle of winter in Canada. I might try DKNY Be Delicious on this come spring, but for now I'd rather pull out the powdery soap and florals.
Edit#2 - Oooohh I sprayed JLo's Glow over this and I am now in love with both! What a wonderful combo! I haven't touched Glow in years and something told me to check it out, glad I did because I've forgotten how lovely a clean scent that is, especially since most of her others were failed attempts for me. On top of this Eternity Now lotion, they both sparkle. So clean, soapy and fresh... and peonies! Ugh love it.

Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"There is an explosion of almost fruity gun powder that hits you when you first smell this. This is refreshing, fruity, a bit brisk because of the explosive notes within the fragrance gun powder which reacts almost like staccato notes within a music composition. (Flower Bomb Nectar is another perfume that has this same type of explosive floral type composition).

I think I would have enjoyed this more in junior high school, high school, college - than now... although this is truly an ageless and timeless scent - it does lean more towards the juvenile end of things...but this is probably similar to Burberry Body (the original) where someone's energy could determine whether they could continue wearing this later. I can see a few women pulling this off, very well. It would definitely have to fit your personality.

I initially ordered this sample hoping that I would like the quince fruity notes as much as I did in Avon's Incandessence Lotus, but this is a different interpretation of quince, I still prefer Incandessence Lotus.

-----------

My first impression was that Eternity Now is very similar to the same type of chemical reaction that happens in perfumes such as Burberry ""The Beat"" perfume - and Burberry ""Body"" (the Original) - (although Eternity Now is much louder and brighter going into an almost sharp type expression compared to Burberry ""The Beat""). This could also be compared to Ivanka Trump's signature perfume which is more of a pink lemonade type perfume, but Eternity Now is more explosive, brisk, and loud.",04/19/22 00:40,correspondencepersonal

This scent has that spring fresh vibe, which make it very likeable and super girly but once it dries down is a little bit more mature floral fragrance, you can feel the neroli very strong, then with the back of the cashmere is elegant and pretty, I just do not know why for some reason this perfume smell similar to La vie Est Belle Eclat to me once is settle... silage is decent and projection okay. I have had this scent for quite sometime now, but I would be giving it away to my mom since I do not use it as much and even tho is a beautiful one, I feel I am past this type of sweet and floral scents. You can blind buy this one safely if you have not smell it before specially if you love pretty floral perfumes.",12/11/21 02:51,AndraLau
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"This is really pretty and feminine. Litchi seems to be showing up in several perfumes of late, at least that I've got my hands on. I'm enjoying them all so far. This one is a smooth, mature, slightly sweet floral. Pretty classic in nature, goes anywhere and anyone could like it. I like it very much.",10/03/21 19:41,mevans
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"Simple, fresh and feminine, this frag is delightful. Peachy but not too sweet. Somewhat “coconutty” to my nose. If this fragrance were a colour it would be nude rose beige. Ladylike and never overpowering, yet identifiable, this would be a good signature. Ok for office or just swirling around in your favourite dress.",09/27/21 11:23,temo
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"I remember being in Ulta when this first came out. Something compelled me to buy a small bottle right then and there that I kept in my slight rotation. It was never memorable enough that I felt the need to repurchase it though because I found my now nearly empty bottle at the bottom of a drawer recently. Maybe I felt that Eternity Now was too boring. Maybe I got caught up in wanting to explore bigger and better options. But now after that long neglected first spritz, it’s all coming back to me why I liked this so much.

Like a lot of people here are mentioning, this is a clean, fresh, sweet, salty, slightly aquatic scent. It’s very common and yet there is something that sets it apart from the multitude of scents in this category. I’ve never heard of a sorbet note in perfume before. It makes sense though. It starts saccharine and dries a little sour. The quince adds the zest and citrus. I really want to believe that I am an independent thinker but my opinion was swayed when I heard shampoo. Yes!!! This definitely has a sudsy, air-dried shampoo vibe. Think old school, rose hip Herbal Essences. I know that sounds generic especially considering how many options there are today but this had me wanting more. It was criminally affordable for a brand new 100 ml off of EBay. Longevity is surprisingly incredible. I could still smell this way after the standard five hour mark. Sillage is very quiet and intimate. It does become a skin scent. If there’s any fault I can find with this one, it would be that I wish that whatever note is bringing the saltiness was amplified and helped it to stay intact during the drydown. Not a big deal because this is still really delicious but that would really make a small improvement. It’s not overly sweet, cloying or in anyway obnoxious which can happen with fragrances like this. I often see the comparison of perfume to a cozy sweater or a white T-shirt. Likewise, Eternity Now would be that Lycra/spandex/viscose tee that knows your body and fits you like a second skin. You are wrapped in familiarity, comfort and cheerful optimism. Nothing exotic, of course. You might feel like it has run its course after a while but there’s still no denying that there is something a little soothingly special here that would compel you to come back every now and again. I am glad to have this in my collection again.",06/20/21 17:15,DieT CroaK
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"This smells like a lovely spring/summer floral fruity body lotion. Why body lotion? Because it has some creaminess to it, but not too much. As someone already said, it does smell a bit salty too! :-) Really uncomplicated floral scent, safe blind buy as an everyday simple feminine scent.",06/01/21 06:54,Elynthia
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"Fruity yes! Wasn't expecting so fruity after the elegant floral and spicy experience of the original eternity! Very wearable, similar to the original in mood, not scent. Warm, intimate, but pure, mature and elegant. Especially for a fruity scent, which can often be overly sweet. Wouldn't describe this as juicy either. Genius perfumer. Am I fan. To me it's a casual, everyday scent to wear at home - when you share it with someone special 😉",05/21/21 00:39,Evenfragrance

Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"It was the first fragrance I purchased with my own money when I came to Europe on a study abroad program in 2015. So there is a lot of sentimental value I have towards this fragrance.

It's a nice floral smell with a little bit of sweetness from the litchi. But the sweetness is more watered down because of the neroli I presume. It's a very easy to wear fragrance throughout the year, anytime of the day. It lasts on my skin about 4~5hrs.

Over the years after trying many other different perfumes, I kind of fell out of love with it. I finished my bottle today. Don't think I will repurchase this but I do have a lot of fond memories associated with Eternity Now :)",03/25/21 14:14,Hum_C
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"I really like this perfume, it’s creamy peony and bitter from citrus zest , and it’s not sharp at all to my nose rather rounded, I thought it would be sharp as seen sorbet on the top note , I never smell anything like this before , I think this is beautiful soothing perfume and last at least 4-5 hours on my very dry skin .",03/04/21 11:37,Yimyim2525
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"I love it. Its unlike any other perfume I've smelled or had. But unlike niche perfumes that are unusual, CK unusual creation Eternity Now is perfectly wearable. It has this wonderful pink soft yet bitter scent to it which is present through and through. So it is linear, being a bit fruity at the start and a bit woody at the dry down. Bright, pink fruity floral but not sweet and with a pretty bitter note.",02/12/21 04:29,bel.gravia
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"A very intimate fragrance sitting so close to the skin no-one will notice you wear it. Eternity now has citrusy and litchi sweet opening. Once it settles it smells floral, fresh and with just enough sweetness to make it pretty. Later developing heavier cashmere musky tones. It's ok for summer day at home scent.",01/19/21 11:53,kobylnice
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"Very fresh and light! To my nose there is a minty, herbal quality, and quite a dose of what seems to me to be lavender. The floral aspect is very very faint to me, and there is very little sweetness in my opinion. Just fresh, maybe even woody. I have tested it twice with the same result each time and I even went back to the website where I purchased the sample to double check it was CK eternity now for women that I had ordered, because my impression seems to be different from what others have written. But everyone’s different! 😁 Final thoughts: I like it but don’t love it. I wish I could smell the fruity notes- it would add so much :)",12/13/20 15:49,TammyRoxanne

Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"Nice rollerball scent.

Fresh fruity scent, indistinguishable floral notes, warmer musky base.

Good for office /t shirt / casual wear, unless you are on top of someone I doubt they will notice

Terrible in terms of strength or longevity. I must have applied 15 times today, rollerball all over wrists neck and cleavage, for a very mild scent.

Basic but lovely.",09/02/20 01:28,tessiebee
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"I don't smell any of the distinct notes described but yet it is still sharp--like Ralph Lauren's Romance and slightly powdery. The initial sweetness disappears extremely quickly. On my skin, it gets more peppery and slightly plastic-y. It reminds me of some body care or hair care product of the 90's. I do think this perfume feels rushed and unfinished, but not in a minimalistic way.",06/16/20 18:52,katsong
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"Bling bought it. Loved it. Its a little bit sour, fresh, floral, sweet. I love any sour fruity fragrance!!! This is a little artificial smell but I still like it.

Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"I purchased this for cheap at the duty free shop. I would say it is very fresh (without being aquatic) and fruity. I mostly get peach - it somehow reminds me a bit of Tresor in love but without the rose note. I have not worn it for a full day as it is very cold where I live right now - I think this would be better suited for spring and / or summer. From what I recall when I tried it out at the airport, sillage was moderate and longevity was quite short lived. I didn't pay much for it so I don't mind that. I am happy to add this to my growing collection.",01/28/20 21:15,Tessa03

Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"Very nice fresh fruity scent - great to wear even on a summer day. Office appropriate.

Reminds me of Chanel Chance Eau Tendre EDT, but if I had to choose between the two, I would choose Chanel in a heartbeat - I think that one has more charm. Eternity Now is like the shy younger sister of Chance Eau Tendre - nice in its own way, but not quite as beautiful as older sis', sorry!",11/06/19 20:38,JustSimpleThings
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"Got a tester of this and it is this sweet fruity scent on my skin. Very similar to other fragrances I have. It makes for a great office scent. I personally don't think it is full bottle worthy but that is because I already own other fragrances that are similar and I love them more.

Longevity: 4 hours
Sillage: very close to the skin
Recommend: If you don't have anything like it
Office appropriate: Absolutely.
Purchase: Nope. I won't be buying it.",07/25/19 05:21,DebiL1211
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"I bought this on a whim shortly after I started wearing MJ’s Daisy Eau So Fresh (which I LOOOOVE but dies to a whisper after half an hour on me) and I was definitely feeling more of the fresh fruity floral vibes as opposed to the cloying floral powder bombs that I’ve been obsessed with in the past.
I’ve never been a fan of CK, I wouldn’t have touched it but the sales assistant was optimistic so I thought wth and sprayed it directly into my wrist.. WOW!! It was an instant YES for me, the sparkling hit of lychee instantly lifted my spirits and I’m feeling the neroli love during the mid. The base notes are soft but there’s just enough muskiness to feel womanly, fruity fragrances are usually too saccharine and girly for my taste.
Yes, it’s inoffensive, it’s not groundbreaking or niche. It’s an everyday fragrance for sure but I can live with being ordinary (most of the time)",03/11/19 03:53,Dark Petal
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"For some reason I got a whole bunch of testers of this during this spring time's perfume shopping. Only recently got into giving it a good test drive as my after gym/pool perfume (love samples for that purpose, cause they don't take up any space).

I have no clue what that fruit is which the main note consists of. There is no translation of it to my language it seems.

Anyway I do really like that peachy/fruity floral yet powdery opening burst. It's really very 'there' for the first half hour or so. It doesn't smell sharp or too sweet on me at all. But mind I live in a very hot and humid climate and most scents are a bit muted down by the heavy air here. It does settle though quite quickly to a peachy floral and within 3 hours it's mostly floral and musky.

I can imagine this being a cozy scent for any kind of climate. It would fit with a turtle neck cashmere sweater just as will as with a blouse or polo shirt.

If you're going to meet people who are sensitive to perfumes, maybe spray it an hour before meeting them. The beginning definitely has an 'oomph' but after an hour I can't really imagine anyone being offended by it.

No big wow here, but I really do like it. If I see a good offer anywhere in store I'll definitely grab myself a bottle.",09/27/18 09:06,latafan

Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"I've got many samples, Eternity Now is one of them I test sometime in office.
To me it's litchi and musk. At some point there's a beautiful salty vibe in it, similar but not identical to coconut milk, that unfortunately for me disappears in the drydown. It's smooth, simple but pretty, delightful indeed!",08/30/18 05:42,masako_30
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"Nice sharp smelling fragrance. I seem to smell coconut through it for some reason, Slightly sickly, but overall a pleasant safe choice. Would class as day wear. Would not buy it again.",08/04/18 15:29,Iris-Siberica
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"It smells sharp and not so great to me when just sprayed, to the point that it makes my nose itch. But once it settles, it's crisp/cold and fresh, almost soapy. I don't smell any litchi or peachy notes. On me, neroli becomes more dominant than anything else. It has got an attitude of a headmistress who is not so approachable and scares the kids to be on her bad side.
I'd give it 8/10 for longevity and 6/10 for sillage.
It's a great to wear in the office or even casually if you like to keep weak people away. It's not warm or mushy at all. I'd wear it from time to time but never make it my signature for my nose's sake.",07/16/18 02:58,rajnigandha
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"My newest blind buy. My initial reaction is, it smells like Paco Robanne Olympea, (which i strongly dislike as it makes me nauseous)..... Eternity Now, however, has a different dry down, and i can see myself reaching for this one occasionally...... The peachy note is more mellow than in Olympea.....",06/19/18 11:37,bango_mo
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"my bad, I didn't spray it on my body when I bought this parfume. it was good when I sniffed from the bottle.
the first time when I sprayed it on my wirst, I was like ""ew, this is bad"" it did smell like Tokyo by paris hilton; I agree with a comment above.
maybe it's from the lemon, but it's too sharp and makes me a bit dizzy.

the day after, I gave it a chance and well the dry down smells better than Tokyo and maybe I started to like this.",06/12/18 04:31,crescentalks
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"I started wearing this again with a new found love. It is peony and neroli with a woody base. Sweet, sour and a tad bitter all seamlessly blended into a masterful concoction that with only a couple sprays projects a clean and fresh veil of scent. This is quality. This is a grown up classic and a refreshing change from all of the new gourmands out there that to me do not project. This is not a skin scent but the fragrance seems to float around you. I would call it a fresh powerhouse.It only takes a couple of sprays so do not overdo.",04/17/18 20:36,sandifitzg

Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"Eternity Now is a fresh, citrusy floral best suited to Summer and Spring. It has an almost shampoo-vibe and brings to mind the Incanto range by Salvatore Ferragamo, which share a similar fresh fruitiness on the skin.

I wore the original Eternity for Women when I was still a university student. I loved its laundry-fresh scent during the warmer months and it was a fragrance I could either dress up or dress down. The subsequent Eternity flankers have honoured the crisp, fresh aroma found in the original by adding more floral notes or centering more on the citrus aspects.

Eternity Now is a bright, sparkling burst of yuzu, litchi, peony, neroli and musk to my nose. It's more fruity and citrusy than floral, however I must admit that this appears to be in its favour. Eternity Now is sure to appeal to those women that live in a humid, warm climate as the scent's longevity keeps you smelling fresh and clean for hours.

Unfortunately Eternity Now is not my personal cup of tea, however I do understand its appeal. It's one of the better flankers from the Eternity range, although it shares very little in common with the original.",09/16/17 22:32,missk
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"To my nose this is a combination of original Eternity and Eternity Moment with a touch of fruit, although I don't find it to be as nice or as interesting as either of those two perfumes.

Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"I curiously reached for the tester and at first spritz I found it simply horrible..even after half an hour I was wondering who would want to even bother with this fragrance or what occasion would it suit..Only when a good bit of time elapsed did I start finding it familiar, and it dawned on me that I had something similar in my younger years..as I started thinking I realized it was Moschino Cheap and Chic..Maybe they`re not similar otherwise, but on me - hell yea.
It`s nothing like the original Eternity or Eternity Summer, this is probably a brand new take - although it`s not quite my cup of tea I must say it would make a good summer perfume as it isn`t too sweet or flowery, more sour, unlike most of today`s perfs, which is really refreshing these days as there has been too much sugary going on..So if you are in need of something a little different than all the candies - try this one of the days this summer. Or if you ever liked Moschino Cheap and Chic (black-white-gold bottle) it could be a top notch for you.",06/29/17 11:16,meliecat

Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"My quest for a Summer heatwave appropriate fragrance continues - and this is definitely in the top 5! My tastes tend towards heavier florals and orientals, however these just don't work in Sydney weather right now.
I wanted something bright and refreshing, like a frozen margerita to wear, and this is perfect. The opening is fizzy and fruity without being sugary, and the musky drydown stays tingly, but a bit cheeky at the same time, and with a surprising depth.
Brilliant for hot summer days and balmy nights.

It is very fruity with the main fruit note being peaches. It makes me nostalgic. I think I had a toy cleaning kit as a child that smelled like this. After a while, it becomes much more musky and dry, and even more reminiscent of peachy dryer sheets. It also somewhat reminds me of a fizzy bath bomb.

I was happily testing away when my hubby said ""smell this one ""I really like it""!
I sprayed a card, and immediately smelled Grapefruit. I sprayed on my elbow crease and went to the Hanndbags.
About Ten minutes later I smelled a fresh, sweetness with that grapefruit still prominent and knew this was for me.

Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"Wow. I really do not understand the negative ratings. I have noticed that often times fresh light fruity/florals get a lot of bad rep on this site, whereas sweeter, heavier more complex fragrances seem to get a lot more fan love. Maybe I am an odd bird, but I generally gravitate towards the lighter fresher scents. Easy-going, fun-loving. They usually seem to resinate more with me. They are just more ""me"" somehow. Lighter, fresher scents make me feel comfortable in my own skin, like me but better if you will. However there is something extra special about CK Eternity Now. I think it is the Peach blossom and the Sorbet that make me go completely gaga over it :)

Granted, I also appreciate many sweet and some heavier scents, but sometimes they make me work for their love, whereas with perfume like CK Eterny Now things are just easy from the get go. That is what I love about this scent. It actually smells AMAZING and I don't have to take time to get to know it or understand it. It's just plain good, from start to finish. No hidden agenda. What you smell is what you get. I love that.

Some might say that this is not a masterpiece. That it is simple and linear and that there is no complexity to be found. Those to me can be positive qualities in a fragrance. To me that does not equal this being a ""bad"" perfume. It means that this is the PERFECT every day scent. The complex and heavy hitters are not the beginning and the end in the world of perfume. They are not all there is. We can have variety. In my case the heavy hitters are surely also appreciated but they can wait for special occasions. I don't want to smell ""complex"" every day. I want to smell approachable and just plain nice and that is exactly what Eternity Now does for me :)",02/04/16 06:03,SillySue
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"After being thoroughly impressed and instantly liking with Eternity Now for Men, I was eager to try Eternity Now for Women.

Unfortunately, this one is not as unique or original as Eternity Now for Men. Eternity Now for Women smells like so so so many other floral-fruity-musky melange fragrances out for women. It's safe and bland. It does nothing different or nothing new. It opens as a bright, aqueous floral with a wisp of something fruity. Eventually it becomes a floral musk.

Ladies, skip this one and check out Eternity Now for Men. That one is unique, original, fresh, and entirely unisex (much like CK Reveal for Men is entirely unisex).

Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"So I found a tester of this, 100mls size for 39.99 on my fav website :) I just got it, and I noticed this site says it's an EDT when the box says EDP. Either way OMFG it's so nice! Hands down new fav!",10/26/15 15:49,Dort0625
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"This is stunning! I was blown away honestly! I kind of like eternity moment and a few other from this line but not any love for any of them, this however was a major love. I'm not sure what notes stand out, but it's very fresh, very soft but bold at the same time. It's the type of grown up woman scent, but a grown up that doesn't have to be too grown up all the time, someone fun and flirty. Love this! Sad that it's so bloody expensive! Saw it for 98 dollars, and. I doNOT pay that kind of price lol",10/04/15 14:23,Dort0625
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,This smelled like a fruit salad on the verge of rotting. Something is just 'off' in this composition to me. Another disappointing new release...,10/03/15 18:12,DarlingNikki
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"Wooow, what a weird sensation to smell this for the first time! It's so artificially fruity - like a strawberry in the middle of winter - with more preservatives than the fruit itself:( And so generic! In no way does this correspond to the whole Eternity range which is a legendary one, it smells more like a low-shelf EDT for schoolgirls below 10. Not that it's very bad but totally out of place and time - like some ""Moomin"" or ""Alice in Wonderland"" sort of thing - childlish-psychodelic kind of sensation... As if someone entered the perfume lab and experimented there for the first time without any knowledge and eventually came up with this with a big smile on their face! No offense, but this was my first impression. I think I'll give it another chance some day but rather reluctantly.",10/02/15 14:54,LadyPilot

Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"As going to buy me a staple I've been missing today....Versace Versense.
I might have just bought me this instead !
I was so surprised over Eternity getting a fresh family member .
As a contrary to most of the earlier reviewers above me, I really liked it !
It was fresh and juicy and lovely , perhaps cause it was this type of perfume I was aiming for this time...
Today I was persistent and bought my old staple for the fourth time,
as I am soon to leave for summerholidays.
I think this is no where near detergent and one of us here , cant count it out so soon...you just wait....
Well done , fresh juicy and potent - not an easy thing to do !",09/23/15 14:45,evacecilias

Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"let me say, I love Ann Gottlieb.
But, this perfume is a disaster. It is a smell, that hit your nose when you enter place where cleaning is done generically. It is this cheap spray or aroma that keep you feeling dizzy and wanting to get out of there as of Now. Sorry, just a disaster.",09/16/15 18:15,Lizka7
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,Peachy scents are often quite nauseous to my nose and this time it hasn't been any different. I can smell a lot of peach blossom and barely any other note. Eternity would be a disaster with such an unhealthy scent.,09/16/15 13:57,Arlene-Beatrix
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"I discovered this today, it overpowered any other perfume I sampled it's quite nice but way too strong for me- very long silage. I have a feeling if I spent more time with her I would come to like her better.",09/05/15 02:07,Jasmine2024
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"Grapefruit!!! That is what Eternity Now screams at you right at the get go. The ""sorbet"" is just an icy sweetness dulling down the sharp tang. The florals never really have a chance to sing because the soapy muskiness masks their beauty, and instead really has a BO scent that rears its ugly head in about 3 hours. No one wants that. Another disappointment from CK in their women's line in my opinion. The unisex and men's cologne are generally far more pleasing.",09/03/15 23:25,SpaceCowgirl

Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,"I found it for a decent price on eBay, and I got a decent fragrance...let' s just say I expected different..seems Ann Gotlieb has a thing for juicy light fragrances..first notes are very bright, juicy bright, like a tropical cocktail, nice, the quince sorbet gives it a different edge,almost like a grapefruit vibrant scent, but the dry down falls flat in my opinion...it is a bit warm, a bit musky, nothing great...i
I don't think it is like Eternity Moment, but it isn't in the base radically different. I kind of prefer Moment...
Calvin Klein is for me a hit and miss, at times, brilliant creations, most of the times, purely mainstream and a bit forgettable.
Eternity Now is just a flop in my opinion, it will never capture the beauty of the original,Eternity Now is more like an Escada, in its fruity cocktail character.",08/07/15 12:08,genny17
Eternity Now For Women Calvin Klein,An update for eternity moment? that one is being discontined but this one seems very similar even the color of the juice is similar.

CK One Summer 2006 Calvin Klein,"For those who miss this perfume, I highly recommend DS&Durga’s Steamed Rainbow. The scent is nearly identical - though Steamed Rainbow is more refined and has better longevity.

CK One Summer 2006 Calvin Klein,"This was my first ""real"" perfume back in high school. Given as a birthday gift, this meant I was no longer limited to the body sprays and splashes of my classmates. This was around the same time I got my drivers license, and a car with no working air conditioning in the Pennsylvania summer. So to me, the sunshiney citrus and bright greens evoke the nostalgia of wind blowing through my hair and the freedom and hope that comes from just starting to grow up.

I wish I could find this or a good dupe",01/28/23 07:15,ScreaminBeeman

CK One Summer 2006 Calvin Klein,"Just picked this up today for about $17, about 90ml left in the bottle. Some of the reviews, such as the one below this, made me go out and find it. I smelled lemon and cantaloupe right off the first few test sprays. After about 20 seconds, I went nose blind to it. Couldn't really smell it anymore after the first half-minute. I'm sure it's very nice for other people to smell it on me, which is one reason to wear it.",05/28/20 03:34,Eau De Treasure
CK One Summer 2006 Calvin Klein,"I searched for this for 9 years! A female friend wore it in 07 and I asked what it was cause I LOVED it.

Sadly, all she said was 'calvin Klein' so I searched and bought anything CK 08 or before so basically purchased all eternity summers and realize none were what I woas looking for. I also bought CK summer unisex 07/08 and nope, so I KNEW it had to be CK summer 06!

Sadly, NOBODY had this for purchase until I found it on eBay! Yayyy and got it cheap considering it's discontinued. I love this, very fresh and citrusy. A bona fide unisex fragrance. My wait was worth it :)",01/28/17 15:05,JetsBabe
CK One Summer 2006 Calvin Klein,"Works really good on my skin, the opening note of melon and citrus combine to create a fresh cucumber/honey dew type scent with sweet and salty undertones created by the musk and incense it is a really sexy and nice fragrance for males that women will be drawn to.",06/27/15 19:27,dayzaway99

CK One Summer 2006 Calvin Klein,"This is my favorite cologne, aside from all the memories it carries. It is very simple, a soft citrus smell that not too lemony/limey, very good blend. I get migraines from smells so for me its longevity is good as well as its projection although for others I can understand it might be too soft.

I really wish they would re release this smell, or recycle it in a future ck summer",08/30/12 20:05,regui8er
CK One Summer 2006 Calvin Klein,"I have this in the 3.4 oz EDT. In my opinion, this is a horrible fragrance in the bottle and on my skin. I think it was a blind buy, or I just thought it smelled good at the perfume store. Either way, I absolutely hate it. It's very strong, and almost has an alcohol scent. It's manly in a bad way. Maybe it's the cedar and incense notes that ruin it? I just can't bring myself to like it, so would not suggest this to anyone.

But I do keep it, because the bottle is very pretty, and looks nice on my makeup table. :)",04/06/12 21:31,Irenee
CK One Summer 2006 Calvin Klein,"I am the kind of person that loves unisex perfume so much especially CK one Summer line, and of course I really like this bottle of CK one Summer.

I would say it's perfect for summer, opens very fresh and citrusy, but sweet and tender enough to be a feminine perfume. I love it from the top to dry-down where it gives a very warm and tender feeling of Musk and Cedar.

I would say that it lasted quite long on my skin, I thought it does not last at all, but I get off work at 6 in the evening and I can't smell anything anymore, yet my co-workers says I smell so lovely so I would say it last about 8 hours, which is good enough for me, although I would say that it has average sillage.

Bottom line: it's a good summer perfume, very uplifting.",08/16/11 19:44,arubadream
CK One Summer 2006 Calvin Klein,"At the time this came out my mother loved it, but I thought it was a little girlie (not that I don't wear femme scents it's just there were so many other mens scents I wanted for my collection) so I passed. Now I wish I'd got it and she won't part with it...DRAT!)

It begins with a melon and petit grain top, fruity fresh and green. The heart is floral-green with the unique sourness of rhubarb and a twist of lemon, quite refreshing. The base is where it got strange for me peach (usually appears earlier in the development)and musk and incense dance around a cedar core that mellows it slightly. I must admit: this one is quite different and while it is marketed as unisex it leans toward the feminine while finishing with a sweet masculine fruity yet aromatic whisper. This is the kind of thing I look for nowadays and there is nothing like this. Three or four years ago I was more worried about how OTHER people thought about how I smelled than with my OWN preferences and pleasure. Learn from my mistakes, I sure did!

CK One Summer 2005 Calvin Klein,"I haven't been able to find this vintage in a few years, kinda sad actually. As we can all tell, this was one of the best years vintages of CK one summer ever. Everything you wanted in a summertime scent, day or night, was in this bottle. So many other designer scents, and more recent vintages of this scent have copied it. It just smelled so Friggen amazing, people actually you'd walk by them on the pier, or in the gas lamp district on the street, and they'd come back after you just to get a smell of this juice.

CK One Summer 2005 Calvin Klein,"I ordered my dad to buy me a specific perfume while he was abroad, but he got the wrong one, which is this one. :p But I like it though. I wouldn't have thought of buying a perfume like this, it's more masculine than my other scents. But it can work for me too, a day I'm feeling sporty.

It's fresh and orangy. I think it can be worn both in the summer and in the winter. It's not heavy.It's a sweet but not too sweet floral perfume, with a fruity tone added by the citrus.

I think it's great for casual everyday wear and it's rather inoffensive. Smells good.",03/02/10 17:13,Hilde
CK One Summer 2005 Calvin Klein,"CK One Summer 2005 is quite close to its previous edition. It starts with really strong notes of orange and peach, but it soon becomes a heavy floral (at least on my skin). I can detect the frangipani note, one of my favorite flowers.

Eternity Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"I blind bought this because of such nice reviews, but this to me smells so soapy! Not woody (that I was hoping for) or floral… it’s aquatic and “fresh clean sheets” smelling, but I must admit that I’m disappointed.",05/26/23 02:02,AimeeZD
Eternity Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"I had this fragrance in 2017, from kohl’s on sale (I think another commenter said the same) and OMG I loved it. I bought the 3.4 oz and used it with reckless abandon…because it’s Calvin Klein! Who would’ve thought finding a Calvin Klein fragrance would be hard?!

Anyway, it WAS hard. I quickly realized how hard it was to find after 2019. Recently, (in 2022!) I finally got my hands on brand new bottles and stocked up.

The middle aquatic notes are so very Calvin Klein (who made some of the most iconic scents in the 80s and 90s)…but something about the bergamot and desert rose top notes, and the saffron middle with sandalwood and musk base notes make an enticing exotic elixir that satisfies my nose and soul.

The aquatic notes appeal to my ""coming of age in the 90s"" heart, but the added saffron in the middle, musk, and spice base notes makes it an alluring sexy adult summer scent.",07/11/22 08:51,COLOREDGIRLSHUFFLE

Eternity Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"Came across this in Khols yesterday half price 34.50 for a 3.4oz. Figured what the heck! Glad I went for it. Got the Men's version as well.

So its a typical CK. Great smell, but sits closer to the skin and can be worn in hot weather or in close proximity to people you wouldn't want to offend with your fragrance. Even though the scent is light it lasts! I sprayed it on my hand last night before bed, and it has withstood numerous hand washings! Scent is an aqueous slightly spiced woody subtle floral. It is somewhat reminiscent of the desert as the inspiration point. However I live in Florida and in the humidity I think it comes off quite beachy. At its base its a lovely sandalwood salted musk. Trust me that smells better than it sounds. Another kill for this bargain hunter! Whoop Whooo!",07/05/18 05:49,Mrs. ELE Arjona

This is very woody to me.
Bvlgari woody.

It has fresh notes along the same strain as others from the eternity summer line.
It could be masculine, especially to someone just starting to try fragrance. I wouldn't say it's a safe blind buy.

Fro me, one would have to layer this with another, I thought maybe Gucci flora, I have that on and I dislike the end sweet notes of it.

Wearable yes, for any occasion or season, no.

Yeah, very woody, floral, fresh.
Nothing sweet or warm about it. Which is also an ok thing.",04/28/17 01:18,dglightblue

Eternity Summer 2017 Calvin Klein,"I just smelled this at Ulta and I'm wondering if these notes are right because I swear this smells similar to CK Eternity Night for Women! This smells like the daytime tropical/beach version of Eternity Night in fact and I love it! Eternity Night is a heavy white floral, but it has a lot of appeal for me; Eternity Summer 2017 has a nice tropical twist added. Even my mom, who isn't into fragrances, said it smells really good. Projection is nice and it's lasted for a few hours so far without changing much on me (another plus since my skin can do some funky things to perfumes).

For what it’s worth, I actually quite like this. It smells like powdery Parma violets to me. Not the most seductive, and it’s certainly a world away from Eternity and Eternity Moment but it’s nice enough.

It lasts a couple of hours of me. I won’t get through a whole bottle so I’m giving it away.",10/03/25 16:34,Gillzathrillza

AND GUYS.... today is a rainy autumn dark grey damy, when I usually wear chopard casmir at home and that was that. I layered them both and it was magic. The mediocre eternity gained sweter vanilla and spices from Casmir and became a bad sexy bitch. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THiS COMBINATION.",09/14/25 02:53,malafoczka77
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"Why I didn’t look up the notes of this before purchasing is beyond me. My personal preferences are not for anything iris or orris or powdery. This is a sweet powdery floral musk. I don’t really see any of the original Eternity’s characteristics. The dry down is slightly more likable to me, although the synthetic sweetness isn’t something I enjoy. I think I was roped in by the deep topaz glass bottle. I’m a sucker for that, and usually find them to hold warm sexy fragrances. This is not that. I admit, I’m just not into this style of fragrance. It is not my personal taste in any way. There are those who love iris, and those who don’t. It’s a pretty polarizing note in my opinion.

Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"I love a powdery, earthy iris scent - and the notes on this looked so promising. Unfortunately I find it to be quite a dense, sweet powder note that dominates in this perfume. It lacks the dry, dusty, otherworldly characteristics of orris that I love.

It's not a bad scent, and for sure it is more appealing to me than the original Eternity, but it also lasts about an hour max even on clothes, so it's a bit disappointing in terms of performance.",05/14/25 17:03,Nocciola23
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"Straight up its marshmallows. Strong, almost overpowering with just one spray on one arm. After 2 hours mellows a little to a nutty, powdery scent. After 4 hours, its the sooty, slightly burnt bottom of the pan you have cooked caramel in.
After 5 hours, a softer vanilla and still powdery but now that just one spray is a skin scent. I have had for about a year, and rarely reach for it because of the very strong opening. Definitely a winter scent.",03/28/25 14:47,rubyred
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"I have to agree with the other reviewers. Way too powdery! It starts off with a strong floral bergamot scent, but then smells like baby powder. Not impressed & would not recommend it.",02/16/25 17:08,Arina8Sierra
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"I find this scent heavy and perfumey. It has a vintage quality to it... it makes me think of showgirls or stage performers from old movies. I can imagine them spritzing this on as the final touch after they've finished their hair and makeup. It's feminine, grown and formal. I wouldn't say it particularly smells like iris to me, but maybe that's just because it's a different iris than what I'm used to. A better one, to be honest! I've never been a big iris fan but I don't mind this. Overall not bad, but it's a bit too dated for me. I like some of the associations it evokes, but it's not something I see myself reaching for that often. It's for who it's for. Not a bad scent, just not fully my taste.",12/20/24 03:43,LaMiaRosa
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"One of the best irisis I ever smelled. It's a refined scent that reminds me of chloé nomad a little bit... but it is definetly not a fresh scent, I would reccommend this more for women between the ages of 30-40 or so.. or for elder ladies.",11/14/24 10:49,sapphirnymphe

Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"This one is actually one of the best irises I've smelled, closest to the bottle I could see myself buying. A buttery, make up bag iris, lipstick, a little synthetic but, definitely iris dominant, no violets, just that touch sweet, smells like a boudoir and i am here for it. Even has that touch carrot seedy earthy vibe which I LOVE in these style perfumes, and a touch of rose always puts a lovely romantic twist on such a perfume. I really like it, lets see how long it performs, I could see myself owning this and wearing a full bottle over the next years! Drydown a beautiful aromatic spring floral. Love it.",05/26/24 11:25,Cherry_Darling
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"This is more of a note-to-self rather than a review.

Yes, it’s synthetic and cheap-smelling compared to my go-to fragrances, but lipstick usually smells synthetic anyway so I don’t mind.
I reach for this when I’m in the mood for a (mostly linear) makeup/lipstick scent that has prominent iris and orris notes, but doesn’t have much complexity or “sophistication” going on -I use Lipstick Rose for that. This smells like a beautiful woman getting ready for an occasion with all of her makeup open and spread on her vanity. When I first got this, I did get the weird banana scent; now it’s been replaced with a bright albeit slightly synthetic raspberry. For the price, this is a lovely option to scratch that makeup scent itch.
It smells nothing like OG Eternity and it makes no sense as a flanker, probably why it got discontinued which is a shame, as this is much more interesting than that entire lineup.",03/08/24 16:18,SalZs
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"The original Eternity was my signature scent in the 90s, and this is a deeper yet more playful iteration. The opening was quite similar to the original, but once the aquatic note dissipates and the base notes unveil is when this one really shines. It is sweeter, and the dry down is beautiful, with the osmanthus shining through.",03/08/24 06:21,christinebyh
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"A creamy , buttery orris in the opening that is soft and settles into a beautiful makeup-y iris . I like that it’s not too sweet , and on my skin I get mainly a make up scent. Wish it projected more but it’s beautiful and worth it for the cheap price .",01/15/24 12:06,Msala140
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"I wore this to bed last night, and whoa! Iris galore! But it's not sickly sweet, and it has an intense chocolate note along with lots of lovely orris root. I can't believe how good this is, and I think it's a pity that it was discontinued. I find it much more interesting than any other recent Calvin Klein scents that I can recall. It probably wasn't the best bedtime scent because it didn't seem to fade away, as I expected--it intensified over hours into a delectable iris-chocolate-rose-vanilla sandalwood concotion. It's a real trip, and it seems to behave nicely on my skin (which I prepped beforehand with unscented body lotion, contributing to the longevity, I'm sure). I will buy another, bigger bottle if the price is right. I wish they would just rerelease this under a different name since it smells nothing like Eternity or any other CK fragrance I can think of.

As others have noticed, it has a pronounced makeup-powder scent, like old-timey luxury makeup, with an almost photorealistic ""lipstick rose"" effect, only it's suffused with iris. It reminds me a tiny bit of my beloved Misia because it's such a good makeup smell, but it's a lot weirder. I see why it's listed as being comparable to Alien--so many of my favorite scents are--but that one is all about the jasmine, and this one lets the iris dominate (along with the similar, more powdery orris). I don't think I have anything else in my collection that carries quite such a Golden Age Hollywood face powder vibe. Just to indulge in some mild anachronism here, I could imagine Rita Hayworth wearing this, but I could also imagine Jeanne Moreau or Simone Signoret wearing it. To me it smells glamorous and melancholy, like a rainy spring day in Paris. It smells like a deep violet dusk. Spectacular!",10/04/23 13:30,rene.saller

Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"I cannot wear the original Eternity. Too aquatic. But these notes look just lovely and I adore a good iris. So I was pleased to see Sephora carrying such a promising looking flanker. Could this be the Eternity for me?

NO!

I want to add that it is an excellent fragrance. The notes are strong and have good sillage and smell feminine, expensive, and modern. It is not particularly unique, nor do I smell iris, but that's non-essential. As a fragrance it is quite presentable and even a good value considering the poor sillage and longevity of many a brand name release.

But.

Do not attempt to wear this thinking that it has no aquatic nature. I don't smell a 'watery note', but the aroma chemical 'calone' is here in abundance. It reeks on me, as 'calone' always has. No complaints on the right skin, obviously.

One note: I'm rather surprised to see these notes listed. I almost smelled the sweet orange blossom/pear note so popular right now with a hint of purple (the elusive iris?!) rather than anything else. But regardless, this is a decent and powerful perfume. ONE spray lasted long past 3 doses of hand sani...",02/06/23 19:07,drugstore classics
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"A familiar lipstick-y waxiness and powdery cold raspberries open up this fragrance. Noting the comparisons to my much grieved Lipstick On, I was excited for it to unfold on my skin. So I waited and waited for the opening to blossom into a warm, powdery iris and vanilla.

It did not.

It simply weakened until it vanished.",01/09/23 16:09,Sanrio
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"This is my daughter’s perfume ( given to her by an admirer) and I just tried it at her house .

I’m a bit spoilt being a niche perfumer lover so on first blast, all I thought was synthetic , sweet vanilla notes .

Very girlie based on the sweet vanilla notes yet mature at the same with the powdery , Orris notes .

I find a lot of mass produced designer/ performers/ cosmetics companies manufactured perfumes just don’t smell like quality ingredients .

Saying that , it’s a pretty scent and I can see it’s popularity.",12/29/22 13:00,Air of Grace
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"I blind bought a 1oz bottle of this because I recently discovered I love lipstick and makeup scents, and this was a cheap find. The opening isn't the best - I dislike watery notes, and mixed with the orris, it's a bit too sharp and gives off wet cardboard vibes. But the water dissipates quickly and a wonderful lipstick scent emerges. I appreciate the addition of the osmanthus note in contrast to the raspberry that's often added to lipstick fragrances - this makes Eternity Intense softer and not so tangy. I wouldn't call it powdery - it's not even comparable to perfumes like Valentina Poudre or Putain des Palaces, which I also enjoy - and I don't get any Play-doh or banana like some others have smelled. To me, it's a soft, slightly sweet lipstick scent, and since that's what I was hoping for, it's a keeper!

EDIT: When I wore this the other day, I realized I smelled like Dr. Pepper in the absolute best way possible. This definitely got sweeter with some time, but I'm not mad about it at all!",12/15/22 11:17,meganlamode
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"My first whiff of this was really off putting to my nose. A strong chemical smell that was just awful. I’ve allowed it to dry down and it’s ok I suppose. Nothing to write home about and I don’t know if I can stand putting myself through the initial blast long term. Not a safe blind buy at all. For some reason it reminds me of the colour purple. Strange scent.

Edit: The dry down is actually nice. Soft, powdery & musky. You wouldn’t know it’s the same perfume compared to the initial blast. Not long lasting or strong.

Edit: Just came back to it again and no, that opening is just nasty. I’ll be giving this one away. It’s not worth me keeping it. Really disgusting olfactory experience for me.",12/01/22 17:48,Gyps
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"Sweet and a bit powdery scent with a hint of ripe and dried autumn fruits. Reminds me of the aesthetics I discovered and adopted when I was 18. Comfortable yet excting and poetic evenings at a conservatory while practicing piano. Warm purple colours of sunsets in a city. A fuzzy sweater. Maple shedding the yellow leaves on the street in front of my school. Bohemian and decadent, I was savoring the moments and seizing the days like there was no tomorrow 🙂",11/21/22 08:29,katarinamalik
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"A blind buy and an interesting addition to the CK Eternity family. The first hit I get overwhelmingly is overripe plum, with strong undertones that took me a hot minute to recognise what I can only describe as "" Eau De Play Doh"".

This was quickly followed by Parma violets with hints of dark chocolate and this continued throughout as a top note. The overall impression I get is of some sort of thick syrupy melange that dries down into the sort of vanilla tobacco that an old boss used to puff on in his pipe back in the days when smoking was allowed in offices.

Sounds terrible but Eternity Intense is not unwearable - pleasant enough and not displaying enough sillage to offend others around you. If anything, sillage is almost non-existent from the get-go - I have to clamp my nose over my wrist to smell it almost as soon as I've sprayed it .

I enjoy a warm skin scent, which I suspect this one will turn out to be, but right now I'm unconvinced about it as a whole. I may grow to like it, but there is a bit too much vanilla in it for me to totally fall in love with right now.

Update: Three hours later and the vanilla has vanished. I am left with Parma violets and similar chalky sweets - a rather pretty skin scent only discoverable by others if they are in close contact with you.",11/16/22 09:00,genericjanedoe
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"Got it because of Yana from The Scented and it's much better than Lipstick Fever. Smells like a modernized powdery iris. Has a woody and clean smelling drydown.
BTW, I don't get any banana smell",11/15/22 11:02,viktorijavla
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,Of course this bears no relation to the original at all but it's a great perfume on its own merit. The opening has one of the most realistic pear notes I have ever smelled. It captures the essence of a perfectly ripe pear - without any syrup on it. Then comes the lovely violet and smooth creamy iris. Again no added sugar - it's much more a classic fragrance. It's quite cold until the very end of the drydown when the warmer earthy base develops. The lack of sweetness might put some people off but if you want a break from 'sugar rush' fragrance this is perfect. Personally I love it - especially for Spring and Autumn. Good sillage and very long lasting.,10/07/22 04:35,cleo cupcake
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"I have been waiting a few weeks now, to get this from the mail. Blind buy, of course, as usual... 🙄 I bought it, because I have heard from so many, that it resembles Lipstick On from MMM Replica. Not really... I have
Lipstick On, and love it so much. Was so happy at the thought of having a dupe for that one, since it is discontinued. But this is unfortunately nothing like it. To me, it is almost a little wimpy. Still, it is a nice fragrance for someone who like soft fragrances, a little bit fresh. I like both soft and fresh fragrances as well, but not this one, so much. I suspect and hope that my best friend would like this, so I will give it to her as a birthday present.
It will be a very good unoffensive random
every-or-any-day fragrance.
I think it was quite pricey for such a soft fragrance, but that was probably because it is not so easy to find anymore. But I think - if my friend likes it, the money will be well spent on her. Because she's worth it.

P.S. And I do not agree that it is powdery at all. To me, first it is too cold and sharp, and then it dries down to something nicer and rounder. With a sillage of one inch from my wrist. Too bad it is not Play-Doh, cherry chapstick and soft makeup, lasting all day, like Lipstick On.

Edit, a few hours later: Having read about some individuals here, who sensed a touch of banana - I began to feel that too. Banana jam, to be precise. So I started to like it better, accepting that it is not a dupe for Lipstick On. I realized that I also can layer it with some ylang-ylang fragrance, or some spicy tropical, to enhance that effect.
So I took a shower, oversprayed this one happily and liberally, and then added a small touch of Le Couvent Aqua Nymphae on each wrist. Now I can sleep well, and dream nice dreams about a caribbean island. 😊
No more bad consciense about wasted money. And I will give my best friend something else, that I actually KNOW she will like.",07/23/22 06:54,Miasha
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"the initial spray made me giggle. It reminded me of a banana shake. That banana scent lingered for a good half hour. then the perfume transformed. it is a "" cuddle weather"" type of perfume. It does remind me of other lipstick-like perfumes, but this stands good on its own. It is not as sweet as lipstick fever, but the powdery makeup accord is present. I would consider buying this if I found it for cheap!",07/07/22 06:04,Aglopez09
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"I had bought a 1oz bottle of this perfume awhile ago. I liked it, but it just either wasn’t my vibe or the right time of year, so I never wore it. One day my 13 year old daughter and I were going through my fragrance collection and she fell in love with this! Previously the only one of my perfumes she ever wore was Hypnotic Poison, but she started wearing Eternity Intense every day, and it smelled wonderful on her! It was fresh and youthful and it just fit her somehow, I ended up giving it to her, as it is now “her scent”. I recently noticed that she was running low, so I ordered her a 3.4oz bottle. I just received it in the mail today and sprayed it on my arm to test it out and it smelled so off to me, I thought I had got a bottle that might have gone bad. I went and grabbed her other bottle and sprayed it on my other arm to test the difference, BUT to my surprise, it smelled the exact same!! I don’t know if it is just the way it works with my body chemistry, or maybe my nose is off, but I can’t believe the difference in the scent on my daughter compared to myself.

She has been told by a few different people that she smells like Dr. Pepper, which is funny because that is her favorite soda. And I can see that when she wears it now that it’s been pointed out
When I sprayed it on my skin it has a weird cardboard scent.
I don’t know what the point of this review is, since I’m not really talking about the notes in this fragrance. I guess just to talk about how different scents smell different to everybody and reacts differently to a persons body chemistry.
I was going to wait to give this new bottle to my daughter for her birthday, but now I’m going to have to have her test it just to make sure it hasn’t gone off so I will be able to return it if it is bad.",05/20/22 08:55,Tifffyy
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"The first time i sprayed it, ughhh! I thought i was struck by strong chemical blast of artificial iris and violet. I waited for a couple of minutes, then i smell some overdoing berries. So lipsticky, syrupy, and almost head-aching. But of course i gave it a chance and glad that i did it!

It became more velvety and elegant after around 20 mins. It has seductive and mysterious vibes in it. The drydown is lipsticky, deep and powdery iris, violet, with strong hint of berries even though they are not in the notes list. Just beware not wearing this in a hot humid day, or otherwise you might kill the human next to you.",04/29/22 03:13,dualaokto
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"I tried this at the store and I liked it enough to buy a full sized bottle online; but the bottle I got was weak and similar to other reviews where the scent seemed nonexistent after a few minutes. I used to own Eternity, and this ""Intense"" version was an Iris bodyspray vs. how much sillage Eternity has when first sprayed. I was expecting a stronger lipstick scent based on what I read, watched on YouTube, then smelled at the store. I expected this perfume to have a much higher projection, sillage, and performance that matched the current reformulated original version. Oh well, it will go on my everyday work/inoffensive scents shelf. The scent does linger on but weakly for at least 5 hours running errands on a sunny morning if that helps. I have smelled Lipstick on and it's similar (just vintage lipstick), but I would recommend more powerful flowery makeup/lipstick scents in this order: Red Door edt, Fred Hayman's Touch, Charlie Red, and the original version of Gloria Vanderbilt. I'm not into spending much on perfumes with heavy violet notes that still smell like makeup, since it reminds me of violet spray cologne and bodysprays sold in Miami, which I enjoy but that scent is normally smelled in my environment.",04/02/22 17:52,panitaz
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"This is one of those cases where the flanker is, for me, so much better than the original. This has the original Eternity DNA, but instead of a blast of white florals, this opens up with a subdued, powdery iris, some soft amber notes, and slowly begins to morph into a beautiful sandalwood dry down that eventually gives way to hints of dark chocolate. For me, this is the epitome of fall, but I can see wearing this in any season. It's relaxing, subdued, subtle, powdery and beautiful.",01/16/22 19:08,cmmarti3

With Eternity Intense, I can definitely see why some people mention that lipsticky/makeup scent in relation to that, I can definitely smell it. :) But it's also fruity (someone mentioned bananas/berries there and I can only agree with that). Very nice fragrance, not a typical drugstore floral, nor an entirely sweet smell. :) It also shares certain similarity with Infusion d'Iris (obviously becaue of that iris note that reminds me slightly of pencil shavings, too).

Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"I expected to like this one, but I can’t say I do. Something about it reminds me of banana moon pies.

As it dries down, I find it more palatable in some aspects, but the parts I like are too soft in dry down and I have a tough time getting past the intro. Maybe I will learn to love it. Doubtful, but I like a challenge.
Update: Performance is disappointing. The iris is so soft on me that I feel it doesn’t live up to the 1st place listing in the accords listing on here. Maybe it’s just me.

I can't smell the ""banana smell"" a lot of the reviewers here were talking about. I could not even smell any flowers. on me it is just sweet powdery vanilla.

Let's say it gets better over time but I still struggle with the first half hour, this period is almost painful but it'snice after that.

Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"Am I the only one who thinks that this smells like baby powder (aka talc)?
Not that that's bad, but I wish someone had mentioned that! I was looking for a Love, Chloe by Chloe - sort of powdery cosmetic scent... and to me, this just isn't it. This is much more demure, very innnocent powder, nothing womanly or sexy in this, to my nose. :/

Edit:
After a few months of owning it.. it has definitely grown on me. I use it as a workplace scent, it makes me feel confident and fresh.
This is a really hard scent to describe but on my skin I would say this is: very strong osmanthus opening but that goes away in 20 minutes and then I'm left with powdery human skin scent. It's bizarre!

Edit2: I totally changed my mind about this perfume, I love it now! I wear it a a bedtime scent usually because I find it very comforting: it's an iris/orris and rose 🌹 powder cloud ☁️🤍😍 ! The 'aquatic' facet adds interest, makes the scent airy (so the powder doesn't become too heavy/ cloying, which is great.)
I think it too me time to learn to appreciate this scent because it is so unusual. But yeah, definitely love it now! 🥰🤍🤍🤍",06/04/20 21:36,JustSimpleThings
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"This smells just like green bananas, just how I like them! I see that its considered powdery, so that must be in the drydown. I just sprayed this and I smell nothing close to powdery. Sometimes iris scents can start off very fruity and then dry down to powdery, so time will tell

15 min later, I'm starting to smell powdery bananas. I'm liking this. I enjoy perfumes that change",05/12/20 03:32,lmwimsatt
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"I jsut received this fragrance from FragranceX. OMG This fragragrance smells so bad. its like wearing a lint sheet and febreze plug in on my arm. Its not lovely., the scent is not something natural. It smells synthetic. I had an idea about what this would smell like and it does not. I will be returning it.",05/09/20 19:01,vluvsperf
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"This is really well done. I don't have a lot of perfumes with iris that I can think of and this fragrance is very unique. It has a fruity scent, at first I thought cherry but it could equally seem like plum or grape. It's sweet and just a bit tart with bergamot. Vanilla definitely and I get a bit of the musky sandalwood base. It's so good!",05/07/20 09:14,mevans
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"As a Iris lover, I'm willing to blind buy almost any fragrance with Iris in it, and that was the case with Eternity Intense.
I'm shocked that i haven't discovered this fragrance sooner as much as I'm on here browsing for another fragrance to fall in love with.

So about the scent! Upon the first spray, i get a sharp sweet Iris, but it's not harsh to the nose. It's almost candy like, but not in a juvenile way. As it settles, the Iris softens and the vanilla kicks in. As it dries down, the Iris and vanilla is still detectable, but it's accompanied by a hint of sandalwood, which i can barely smell. I can't detect the other notes listed and that's totally fine because the Iris is so amazing in this fragrance. This sweet-tart Iris note reminds me so much of the Iris in The Only One by Dolce & Gabbana. As far as performance, it's very moderate. It's starts out strong in sillage and becomes a skin scent after a good 4+ hours.

I recommend that Iris lovers give this a try.

Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,Just received this and have to agree with reviewer before me ... all I get is PEAR ... a lot of pear !! It does quiet down a bit but that's mostly all I get. Have not worn it out for a full day yet so cannot speak for its longevity. Will update my review later on.,02/06/20 00:31,Tessa03

Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"It's not listed in the pyramid and hence not used in this fragrance probably, and I may be the only one sensing it, but I'm gonna write it nevertheless... what I feel in the opening very strongly is... the pear. A lovely one btw. Sort of the one with which Poirier d'un Soir by Miller Harris starts. It's here for about 10 minutes and then it fades. This is when other notes (normal ones:D) start to surface. Absolutely intoxicating iris flower and orris. At the end it settles down to a cosy musk and sandalwood with a hint of vanilla. It does smell niche and it's not a crowd-pleaser imho. I'm so glad I added it to my collection. Blind buy at the TK Maxx and absolutely worth it!",01/15/20 00:49,agarobka
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"Lovely perfume, a dry iris with a lot of make up powdery notes, chic and easy to wear. Reasonably priced while it smells way more niche.

Not an Eternity kind of perfume by any means, but who cares. I am tired of trying to explain marketing choices. This could be called Serenity or Sincerity or Protection and it would work just fine.
I'm giving ideas here people! Ha, I would wear sth called Protection. We all need it.",01/05/20 03:29,mypersonalharmonics

Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"This opens with an unconventional combination of clear watery notes and powdery iris. Unfortunately, on my skin, this comes off as plasticky, as others have mentioned.

The watery notes fade away in a few minutes and leave behind a sweet vanilla-iris combo. The drydown is pleasant enough, but the opening isn't great imo.",02/20/19 09:05,zhiang0113

Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"I love Iris and Orris. And here I get Orris, bergamott and Iris. First minute it was all about playdoo-plastic-smell, but after 8-10 minutes I got Orris and Bergamott. A come-and-hug-me-scent. Lovely indeed. For a daring man I say - try it, if you're into orris-scents. I like it alot. Not in your-face-strong, more like a teasing ghost circeling around you.",12/07/18 12:33,Mooniq
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"OMG the powder in this one ...
The Iris note smells almost like candied violets...
Eternity Intense I adore you.
Heavy powdery, feminine and beautiful Iris, followed by orris, vanilla and musk.
Clean, comforting and very sexy in a non screaming way...
The beginning is very out there and the drydown is more subtle.
Classy, modern and elegant.
Longevity and silage is average.",12/05/18 23:34,louiee

Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,So disappointed once again. I started wearing Eternity for women back in 1990 or maybe a little before and it was the best smell humanly possible. Years later I bought a new bottle and it was not at all the same as I remembered it. I figured out what was missing mostly was the green notes that made it so beautiful back then. It's as if they took everything great out of Eternity and left us with some shell just enough to remember what it used to smell like for a second. The Vintage eternity also lasted all day long. What they're selling now as eternity doesn't last an hour. Anyway enough complaining but I've been on a mission for a long time to find something that smells like it. I thought I was going to get lucky with this. Why not bring back real eternity and call it eternity intense? Makes perfect sense. Of course that's not what they did. I don't understand. Where has the Beautiful special eternity gone? And since they know that they have destroyed what once was a beautiful perfume why would they not attempt to bring it back even as one of the flankers? I bet it's not possible to find one single person that would prefer the fake eternity that they're selling now over the real thing that they put out in the late 80s. If anybody knows of any of these Calvin Klein fragrances that resembles real actual eternity please tell me what that is.,06/30/18 19:55,waskotransportation
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"I picked up a 1oz at Marshalls for a good price, and I wish I would have bought the bigger bottle they had because I really like it! Its earthy and sweet. It is powdery, but in a good way. This is one I suggest smelling for yourself. My Husband and I liked this so much we wanted to get the Eternity Intense for Men, but when we smelled it we didn't prefer it. I think we should try it again, because we were sampling too many fragrances that day. This reminds me of the ""invent your scent"" collection The Body Shop had in the early 2000's. They had 8 different fragrances, and you picked two and sprayed them together to make up your own signature. What two it was is kind of moot, because they discontinued it, so hopefully CK doesn't do away with the Intense any time soon. Try it, hopefully it works for you.
*****UPDATE 7/3/18****** Just got a bottle of Lacoste Natural and it smells like a sport version of CK Eternity Intense in the dry down. CK Eternity Intense has become one of my favorite fragrances, and my Husband also loves it! I think its pretty unique and I haven't smelled it on anyone else.",05/02/18 03:51,Mrs. ELE Arjona
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"Wow. I typically have trouble wearing iris, and most Calvin Klein scents don't agree with me, but this is actually pretty good.

This opens with osmanthus and doll skin musk. The vanilla is creamy and ever-present and keeps the iris and orris from going powdery and soapy as my skin likes it to do. Occasionally there is a fresh bergamont note or sweet sandalwood. There is a candy sweetness that comes and goes.

This is fascinating and I will definitely be playing with it in the future.",04/09/18 09:01,cedar_lea
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"After applying from my decant, I had to run right here to figure out if I had one from a really old bottle, etc. It appears the consensus is this is an odd one, so here's my take from my sample.

The first two minutes were dead on for my grandfather's barn -- which is actually a scent I crave, but did NOT expect to find in a Calvin Klein release. Before you get too afraid, his barn was full of old hay and alfalfa (a very fragrant, sweet grass), dust and never had animals in it. In the first minute or so, blam, there's the dust and hay if you sniff hard enough. Then it vanishes as the alcohol fades and the iris and vanilla slowly turn up. There's a point where it seems like there's no scent at all between the hay and the iris/vanilla. Just wait. It'll get there. When it does, it's fine. It's nothing special, not necessarily worth the trek through the barn unless you dig that sort of thing.

Needless to say, this is not the scent you spritz on *just* before your big job interview. (Unless it's at a farm supply store.)

I can't speak to a comparison to Le Fin Du Monde, but I can see comparing this to a creation of Etat Libre d'Orange. The level of experimentation is way beyond the usual safe zone of Calvin Klein. I'm surprised this made it past all the marketing focus groups, etc., that it likely had to go through and really wonder if there isn't some chemical ""time bomb"" of sorts that turned or altered before all the bottles made it into the distribution network. But that is just a *completely uneducated* guess.",01/03/18 09:12,mulberryletter23
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"I really like this one. Feminine but not too flowery or fruity. This reminds me of something I already have though...Avon Attraction. This is kind of like a better blended version of the Avon perfume. I like it though!!! It is sweet and woody and with a bit of musk. I probably won't buy this one since I have Avon's version, but this one is really pretty :)Floral is the second listed note for this, but I don't get very much floral out of this at all...",12/20/17 04:29,kristamb
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"Now for something different! This smells like the inside of a suede purse with lipstick, face powder, a used mini bottle of vodka and a travel tin of cocoa butter all rolled into one warm, unusual fragrance. Not for me in the least, but this smells so different and sophisticated, I might be willing to give the sample a try on skin (I smelled it off a clean cotton pad to get a general gist of it).",08/05/17 15:04,DarlingNikki
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"I love the original eternity for women, but it's winter here in Australia at the moment, and I think it's a summer fragrance.
I tested Eternity Imtense today amd I really liked it very much. It is soft, powdery, classy and a bit different. It lasted about 4 hours and I'm happy with that as it's inexpensive from My Beauty Spot.
I was wondering if it would layer well with the original eternity?? What does everyone else think?",06/17/17 20:52,1Madeleine2
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"After wearing this more, it gives an illusion that's it's an EDP. It's heady without going cloying. It has some weight and you'd expect it to stick around. Only, it doesn't. After the 4 to 6 hours mark this will fade. Granted I live in a hot and humid country but this one definitely performs like a cologne or EDT. It's a shame because it is a gorgeous scent. I still enjoy it though.",05/13/17 18:04,PocketRocket
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"This is just such a lovely warm comforting fragrance to me.
Not 'screechy' sharp or sickening sweet, it is definitely a skin scent with my body chemistry.

Love the opening & it's transition to the heart & base notes is pretty swift...I wish the longevity was there & am disappointed about the misleading 'intense' sale pitch.

It probably needs just one or two more notes/chemicals to bring it more to life & an intense level, but all the same, it is gorgeous & I just have to keep reapplying throughout the day to get my 'fix' of this scent.

It is not in the slightest bit related to the original & they could have called it something else entirely new.
Not as unique as REVEAL, but still something different than other current releases out there, especially for lovers of iris/violet powdery freshness with underlying creamy vanilla.
All in all, a beautiful wearable scent, for all seasons, all times of the day.",04/30/17 19:07,bananas
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"Chocolaty, plummy with a slight coffee aroma. I know this is supposed to be Iris + Orris + Vanilla but I get a toned-down boozy quality that may taste like coffee and chocolate.
This is of the night but not dark, midnight or pitch black. It has a dusky quality that I enjoy.
I've noticed how young perfume users will recoil but experienced fragheads will like this or at least acknowledge its uniqueness.
Probably underrated.
This isn't a sledgehammer. It has average longevity and amazing initial sillage that will taper down.
I didn't care for the male version.",04/30/17 17:57,PocketRocket
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"Eternity intense

Tried again today on a pulse point not layered.

What notes are in the top and heart? Tell me please.

I get straight alcohol, not as in the cheapie frags, but actual vodka, that taste of a vodka shot, not the burning, the flavour.

The end notes are what I would like the scent to be, then and only then do I get the main accords.

Try before you buy, not safe blind buy",04/29/17 01:04,dglightblue
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"Bug spray opening, I thought yuck straight off, it was like a plastic.
But now is woody, warm, dark vanilla, powdery, yeah not bad

So... medicinal opening perhaps, with woody overtones, I layered it with eternity now just because it was on the same shelf in the shop, that helped to lift it.
Not a pretty girly or intense light sort.
If you're exploring woodsy, or medicinal but not huge sillege sorts, check it out.

Hope that helps",03/31/17 22:31,dglightblue
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"Got to test this today, on paper and skin. It was rather nice on paper first, definitely got a lovely iris/orris root powder scent. Sprayed on my skin (one spray to wrist), it unfortunately fell short of expectations - mostly synthetic vanilla and 'water'. Put me in mind of sunscreen, beach etc. Longevity and projection are quite good - I could smell it without lifting my arm to my face for about 4 or so hours.",03/26/17 23:30,Equestre
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"Tried it today. I collect the eternity line so I've been waiting for this very impatiently. The sales assistant past me a square of paper with a spray on it and it smelt unusual but all I could smell was the paper. I applied it to the back of my hand and all I could smell was the paper again. Obviously that wasn't the paper I was smelling. I was getting a deep warm sweet caramelly vanilla all hidden under a starchy paper smell. I was very disappointed. ""Different"" the sales assistant commented. I had to agree. I've nothing papery in my collection. Feeling deflated I returned to work where one co worker hated it and the other loved it. I wanted to love it too but it just wasn't happening.
An hour or so later I reached up to scratch my face and got the most beautiful soft vanilla fragrance, which some 4 hours later still remains, having withstood several hand washes.
So it seems maybe I do love it after all.",03/15/17 22:01,Sammi_co
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"To my surprise, I am in love with this! The first moment of this scent are like a soft, sweet tide taking me. :) All I can say is for me this fragrance is a total feel-good perfume. Sweet and strong and warm, the first instance a big surprise (check the notes and try it yourself, it is a unique combination, trust me). On me, vanilla is the most powerful after some time. Totally love it. Must have it the sooner the better.",03/13/17 22:55,trucalling
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"It is goooood! Strange,but nice. The first few moments are the best. Powdery, sligthly earthy iris. My favourit. After a while it becomes sweet and mild. For me this sweetness is a little bit Cherry flavoured, and not the listed simple vanilla.",03/09/17 11:09,dormir6
Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"A strange fragrance.
I almost washed it off my hand because the first (and second, third, etc.) sniff was like being slapped or running into a wall. I could not even identify what it was but I did not like it. I am guessing it was the orris, but I found it unpleasant.
Now, luckily I was quite busy with work and I started to sniff something pleasant after a few hours. It developed into a lovely clean vanilla scent that is just now fading after about 8 hours.
I do not see much in common in this scent and the original one.
However, in total I gave it a ""Love"" rating because how pleasant it turned out to be.
I am just not quite sure what I could do to rush through the unpleasant first hour (or so) of its development.",03/09/17 10:47,arrowdk

Eternity Intense Calvin Klein,"Tried it at the store, walked around for a bit, I thought, oh my, this is different! Not your typical Eternity flanker...it has a bit of the original, in the Chypre undertone, some orris, some sea notes give it a different edge...so yes, I bought it because it simply smells not ordinary!! I like the warm Iris too...the dry down is more basic sweet, not too much..I don't know about the intense part though, it isn't real bold, it doesn't project greatly...but it has depth, this isn't a boring generic flanker..I like it, very feminine...pretty vanilla/ Iris combination.",02/22/17 13:13,genny17

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"I bought this when it first came out because I liked it. I still think it was one of the best of its kind, aquatic floral or cucumber/melon/calone summer freshie. Not usually my cup of tea, but this is really good.
At the time, I wore the original Eternity every day for about a decade. It was a perfect workhorse or highly functional fragrance, I loved it, people around me did too, it was cool, comfortable and with incredible longevity. Many people still associate it with me. But, after more or less a decade, I was not the same person anymore.

This came from the time when CK ment quality. I have two handbags, about 15 and 20 years old, that are in mint condition. Worn a lot, but pretty much indestructible. I payed for a bottle of Eternity 15 years ago twice what I would today. I haven't finished it yet. I don't wear it much, but when I do, it's even better than I remember. So what happened with this brand? How it became cheap instead of just reasonable? Did reformulations destroy perfumes I knew back in the day? How about clothes and handbags today, certainly not as fashionable as they were, but how do they behave?",08/14/25 15:32,jazzfan

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"About now when spring is just right around the corner with summer coming up not far behind, you are probably looking around for your usual staples for spring and summer wear. For those looking for this scent, you might have a problem finding it and if you do, the price is exorbitant. Here’s an option for you but I highly suggest you try getting a sample of this first to see if you have the same result that I do.

…and just what is that result, you ask? That DKNY Be Delicious Fresh Blossom is very nearly a dead ringer for this scent. I have both and for the most part, I can’t tell them apart. They both have several notes in common. So, if you can’t find this scent, give DKNY BD FB a go. I don’t think you will be disappointed.

Another scent to try is Beautiful Magnolia by Estée Lauder. I find it to be even closer to being a perfect match. About 95% I think.",03/06/23 19:42,ChelleBelle84

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"I came in with low expectations but I was pleasantly surprised! Although it is a little sweeter than I would usually go for, I find that it has enough ""freshness"" to it to still balance out into a pleasant, refreshing scent. Also, it performed WAY better than I expected it to- I got a full day's wear when I wore it to work (office setting), and it was still projecting pretty well by the end of the day!

It smells like a sweet ocean breeze to me- perfect for the summer! It will also generally be my office scent because I usually lean towards dramatic and imposing where this is a good balance of being strong, but not intense. It's definitely what I needed to diversify my range. It's also a major compliment-getter. I will admit that it's not the most unique or impressive scent out there but it's a lovely perfume if you take it for what it was intended to be and set the highbrow standards aside (coming from a former ""snob"" who refused to go anywhere near sweet florals).

Would highly recommend, especially for the summer or if you live in a tropical area.",05/12/22 13:57,peebs1605

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"Upon first spritz, before evaporation it's watery and cucumber heavy, but once it's settled its very floral. I can smell most of all the dewy decadence of fresh bloomed jasmin, with hearty notes of white Musk and mellow sandlewood. It's unusual not to smell any citrus in an aquatic perfume, but it works. I think there may be a dash of lemongrass in there, though. It a has mild, sweet, grassy allure to it.

A wonderful fresh soapy scent. It's incredibly clean, but I wouldn't say unique. Growing up in the early 00's there was a lot of aquatic perfumes from Disney Princess EDT to department stores own like Next. This reminds me of a fragrance I got for my birthday from the above mentioned, Next. It's very nostalgic, and I feel its impossible to be down while wearing it. It's very uplifting",06/08/21 06:30,Nazbro

I also feel it is similar to Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue, except this is lighter. Highly recommend!",11/08/18 13:59,Katastroph33
Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"GREAT WOKR BY CK!

So, I did some blind test on my wife and so the first impression she got was — uh that's nice and has a bit of masculine side to it. I smiled because it's women's version. She then said that yeah it's sort of unisex like CK2 (She loves that one).

Then later I did another blind tests with two samples — Aqua for men and women. She had a total turnoff for men's version as she said it was just very intrusive with the strong peppary note on top of it.

In the end Eternity Aqua for Women (not men's version) is a great smell for ladies and millennial lads too.

I personally like both version's of aqua, but the guy's version is just too needy and offensive at times. This one is just a great smell for any human to have",09/14/18 12:23,arielX

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"Putting my nose to my wrist I really enjoyed the freshness an floral notes. Until from a distance I cought a wiff and absent mindedly thought ""What smells like cat urine?"" The perfume started to smell sour and a wrong kind of sweet. It just doesn't work for me.",08/29/17 16:50,arodarmt
Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"If you're in the cool air conditioning, 15 minutes after spraying this on, you will not be able to smell it. This blooms in the heat. This is great for outdoor events like picnics, barbecues, being around the pool or at the beach, on a boat, etc., this is where this perfume shines. Lasts about 6 hours on me starting from cool cucumber and juicy apple to a floral heart and then woody musk at the end. Some have said that the cucumber and apple sours on them but I haven't experienced that on my skin. It stays cool, crisp, and aquatic until you reach the base notes. Been wearing this every summer since it came out. I've tried many CK fragrances over the years and I have to say that this and Eternity Purple Orchid were the best.",07/02/17 18:58,ChelleBelle84

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"Because I am the fragrance addict that I am, I'm leaving yet another review!!! Ya know it's funny, being from where I am from within Canada, I am very limited in places to buy perfume...mostly Shoppers Drug Mat and Sears, which are both outrageously overpriced....so I always love going to the USA on a shopping trips because there is Kohls, Marshalls, TJMAXX, Ulta, Sephora, JCPenny, and that's just to name a very VERY small few of the stores I venture to while on said trip...so ya know, tonight I was out-supposed to be Xmas shopping- and I realized that holy crap there is a Winners in the city I live...its on the total opposite side of the city from where I live so that's why I assume I never even thought to look there! WELL WELL WELL MERRY CHRISTMAS TO MEEEEEEEEE!!! Hahaha I found this in a gift set for $29.99- it had a 50mls bottle 15mls bottle (bother of perfume)and a 100mls of the lotion.

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"This is my hot weather fragrance I wear to work for a professional, yet cool sort of feeling. I live in a coastal beach area in Western Australia. I would describe my fashion sense as classic, stylish yet has a slight undone look. For example, white crisp linen shirt with a crumpled look paired with a professional looking pencil skirt. Hair kind of messy from an undone bun and skin golden from the summer, but I always have a YSL or Chanel lipstick. Caring and carefree, like this fragrance. It's about 40 degrees today so I was using this a few times in the day to fresh up and give that clean shower feeling.

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"I'm not sure what it is with me and summery scents but my skin just eats them up and my nose can't detect them. Or if it does, it doesn't smell anything special.

I have been looking for a light summery ""holiday"" kind of perfume, I liked the look of the notes and so I blind bought this.

At first sniff i smell cucumber, apple, and some generic summery florals. Pleasant enough but half an hour later it's gone, and when I sniff my skin close up, all I can smell is cheapish generic ""smelt it all before"" kind of smell. I kept reapplying this throughout the day and still could barely smell it. And again, when I did there was nothing special. I'll probably use it up on holiday or chuck it in the drawer at work to reapply throughout the day but overall it's disappointing. Nothing special at all. Meh...",08/16/16 12:11,gugute
Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"Beeyooootiful!!!! Gorgeous, scrumptious perfume! Oh Calvin, you've done it again for me! I'm in LOVE with this! It's so fruity, (I can smell the apricot very strongly, as well as the pink lady apple - so yummy, mouth-watering!) florally (all those fabulous white flowers! Oh, so delicate, so fresh, yet very strong) and warm woody smells. It is so fresh and uplifting, clean, watery, like I'm floating in a beautiful cool calm sea, with a slight breeze wafting around me full of delightful scents, the sun gently warming me, and the lovely lovely blue ocean stretching as far as the eye can see, and smell. Oh, just wonderful! Blissfully peaceful and calming. A truly perfect perfume. Fantastic longevity (15+ hours, and very good sillage). One of my very favourites! And I love the style and elegant shape of the bottle, and the gorgeous blue of the perfume! (although it's probably the bottle that's coloured? I haven't used enough of it yet to be able to tell! I'm sure it won't take me too long though!) My husband loves it too, and he is very fussy! He thinks it's very nice!",07/01/16 21:50,blue angelic

I already own the original Eternity which I love (has nothing to do with this though) and the Summer Version 2014 and Eternity Purple and Eternity Night - they are all just perfect and my favorietes from the Eternity Range.

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"I tried the Eternity Aqua about 3 years ago and thought it was nice, but I did not buy it. Now, in the dead of winter, I bought a one once bottle at a great price. I sprayed and my enter body, not just my nose responded with, ""lets have more of that"" as if I were eating a cookie! I really do like it. It's a crisp floral with extra freshness (cucuumber?) and a sexy, seductive quaity that must be the cedar and musk. this is definately a unisex scent (strong masculine quality - a turn on for me) and yet is pleasantly floral. the aquatic aspect is in the background (nice and will be appreciated in the summer months). All and all, it is different from the other aquatic ozionic fragrances I have (cool water, Paradise Blue or Avon's Instant Vacation scents) Eternity Aqua is fuller and richer than the rest. I am able to smell most of the notes and the blending is very good. I have personal problems with smell these days and am not able to smell many scents for more than 30 seconds and only part of the composition. this leads to screechy scents in many cases. this perfume seems very full bodied although I have sprayed quite a few times and can feel a headache from overload. I am very happy to have this in my collection and will be wearing it tomorrow after my shower for a more intense evaluation. I am very pleased.",01/17/16 00:25,ingahoberg
Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"The other fragrance the salesperson suggested when I asked for a ""fresh, not sweet"" fragrance. Sprayed on the top of my other hand.

It is indeed not sweet. On me, starts very aquatic and a little woody, with not much fruit or flowers.

This would have pleased me, were it not for an unpleasant note which I suspect is the cucumber. Unfortunately, most cucumber notes get unpleasantly artificial and odd on me.

As the cucumber note disappears, around 1 hour or so from spraying, becomes a woody aquatic fragrance, and dry like a dry wine. Almost what I wanted, only a bit too linear. There's some clean musk there too.

Not buying this one either, because of the cucumber and because I still hope to find a wood scent that suits me more.

It seems nice and office-friendly if your skin handles cucumber better than mine.",01/14/16 14:25,theuntrainednose
Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"It is what it is, an aquatic ozonic splash with a pinch of sweetness from the apple note. I find it like Gap 655 for Women but not as harsh in the dry down.

My new summer favourites don't have that ozonic note.",11/26/15 21:31,Swamp Lily

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"Eternity Aqua by Calvin Klein is a very fresh, summery aquatic that people will either love or hate. Floral aquatics are possibly one of the hardest fragrance groups to wear as many women can't get past the oddly synthetic nature of such scents. Admittedly I don't wear many aquatic scents, but I do appreciate them come Summer, especially seeing that I live in a very warm and dry climate.

This fragrance has a crisp floral aspect intermixed with sea salt and a blast of refreshing ocean air. It is very Summer appropriate and would make an excellent choice for anyone that lives in a particularly humid part of the world.

The watery cucumber note in the opening of Eternity Aqua smells really pleasant on my skin. As I already own the masculine version of Eternity Aqua which also shares this note, I am very fond of the cucumber accord. Towards the heart the floral notes come into play with tons of peony, jasmine and magnolia. The drydown is predominantly a soft mix of white musk and salty woods.

I do enjoy wearing Eternity Aqua for Women, however I must admit that it can't hold a candle to its masculine counterpart Eternity Aqua for Men. I find the female version just a touch too floral for my personal tastes.

Eternity Aqua is a fragrance along the same lines as Davidoff's Cool Water and Issey Miyake's L'eau d'Issey. If you like those fragrances, you'll surely enjoy Eternity Aqua as well.",09/16/15 17:41,missk

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"I absolutely love this! Eternity Aqua is such a clean and refreshing aquatic fragrance!

It starts with a splash of fresh and crisp cucumber and apple-apricot note, and then mellow down to soothing floral notes like gardenia, magnolia, jasmine etc and light musk.

The scent doesn't change too much though - it is a very weak fragrance which barely lasts for about one hour max on my skin (sometimes just half an hour!). Overall, if you like something fresh and aquatic with crisp fruity top and floral base that doesn't offend anyone, try this out!",08/26/15 21:13,cyyong29
Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"Before buying this preciosity I read most of the reviews I found here and a word caught my attention: CUCUMBER.

Now that I finally got the perfume (a blind buy as you see) I assure you that Eternity Aqua for Women is on the top of my favorite fragrances list! I can´t stop sniffing myself! lol

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"Oh yeah, much better than plain ol' Eternity. my first day wearing this, and I am truly enjoying it. It starts with a bold water scent to me, very little cucumber, and none of the other top notes listed. Just water water water, and i love that. it's one of my favorite scents in summer. Then as it dries down I get a watery honeysuckle scent that catches my attention on occasion. Finally, after about 5 hours, all I'm getting is honeysuckle. Again, not on the list of notes, but at this point I don't care. I guess I could call it jasmine, but it's not like that to me. I love both flowers, and this is very specifically honeysuckle. Mmmm. I am still catching whiffs of it through this last, 6th, hour, from one arm. I truly like this one. Finally!",06/04/15 11:13,AnitaWV

Very VERY refreshing. Got it for cheap at tj maxx.

I wish the other notes would say something to me, especially the apricot.

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"i love this stuff. I know there are a quite a few people here that arent impressed, but I am the kind of girl that prefers lighter, easier to wear scents for the most part. This one is fresh and clean, aquatic but not too crisp, all without being soapy. Its light enough to wear in the summer in Florida heat and humidity, which is hard to find in my opinion. (I hate when I can smell someones perfume from 10ft away... ugh.) The drydown is nice and soft as well, not overly musky (I also dislike most musk scents- too heavy and oppressive.) This is my staple scent throughout the year... (except the few cooler days in FL when I can wear my heavier, creamy caramel based smellies without offending everyone on the block.) ;)

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"I get lots of cucumber and apple, obviously...its lush and it is ozonic and airy. Not as good as the original only because it isn't as unique. If you are wearing this, you could certainly confuse this with a handful of others. A better ozonic is Bvlgari omnia crystalline edp in my opinion. But it is fresh, and it lasts a few hours.

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"Eternity is my signature fragrance but, when it comes to Eternity Aqua, all I can say is - no, no and no!
And this, pretty much, applies to all other special editions as well.

I often compare them to Issey Miyake which is my 2nd most favourite fragrance- I love all versions of that perfume. The designers have, somehow, managed to keep the base intact and play with the character. Moreover, every single version echoes the name that it carries- floral, lotus, Absolute...
I can't say any of this for Eternity versions. From the perspective of a happy customer of Issey Miyake special editions, I could say that something seems to have gone badly wrong with the variations of Eternity- I just don't feel the original notes anymore. I don't find Aqua at all aquatic. The aquatic version of a ozonic/aquatic fragrance should, IMHO; be lighter and more airy than the original. In this case, it's an almost green, an not at all light. It has no character either. What I find to be soapy in a positive way about the original, turns into a dish-washing detergent soapy in this version. And, I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't care for this detergent either.
I'm having trouble detecting the base note that spoils the fun, it's not Cedar but it is something woody.
I just don't like it. Besides, it leans towards a man's cologne.
It definitely doesn't match the price.",10/29/14 12:38,promaya

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"got a sample at Sephora, and I usually will spritz my wrist then sit at computer looking at this site, and wait for the full effect of the perfume. So far, I get just a clean/sharp scent, almost masculine on me. I prefer more sensual, soft, musky amber vanilla scents so this is far from that. To me it smells like men's cologne and it kind of gives me a stomach ache the more I keep sniffing it up close. But when I wave my arm around, it smells nice and fresh. Might be a good one for hot summer days. I prefer my VS Bombshell though.

Update: I always like to sample perfumes again, because maybe that day was different. So decided to try this one again. I get the same effect as before. Very sharp on my skin. When I get ones that are too sharp they remind me more of a house cleaning product like windex rather then perfume. Not my cup of tea for sure.",06/14/14 05:24,cheriebeary73

It doesn't draw too much attention to yourself although people do notice it when you walk by, even when you think the scent is gone. So the longevity is good at 6+ hours and so is the sillage although not overpowering. Glad I picked up this perfume.

Update: Make sure your skin is well moisturized. This, I've found, has a very high alcohol content that can dry your skin making the fragrance not last very long. Argan oil helps tremendously.",02/28/14 17:26,michelle.p.stpierre

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"Not that I need another perfume... but I bought it anyway. It was on sale at a fantastic price (which is rare for Australian retail!) and I just could not resist because the thought of this scent lingered in my mind since first trying it several weeks ago. To me, this is just lovely. Not a ""wow"" type of fragrance, but more of a ""mmm delicious, I just want to whiff my wrists"" type of scent.

Eternity Aqua is clean and opens with a refreshing cucumber note. Not in a tangy or irritating way either (ever notice how some scents just get right up your nose and almost burn the skin inside your nostril from their harshness?). Not this one, this scent is well bodied and rounded and soothing from the first moment of application. This scent has both gardenia and magnolia, which are my favourite flowers-their blooms are beautiful and smell divine to me. There is almost a sweetness to the floral and aquatic notes, which hits the spot with a gourmand lover like me. I find this perfume to be a really great base to layer with sweeter perfumes. The scent doesn't change too much during the drydown for me, other than for the crisp top notes mellowing down to softer and warmer versions.

To me, this is a grown-up take on Cool Water Woman, which was my signature scent as a teenager years ago. Definitely love at first whiff. This scent takes me away to a happy place.",06/20/13 16:27,jennylovesjohnny

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"I was so excited to try this - it's been a while since CK has wowed me with something and that despite me being a big time CK fan in the early and late nineties. So this I had high expectations for.

Let's just say, for something with the name ""Eternity"" on it, it sure falls short. Very short. It's nice, yes. But that's just about it. Nice. Inoffensive. Ok.

I'm missing thart je ne sais quois, that splash of freshness, that mmmmmmmm effect I was so hoping for, instead it's just blah. Kinda clean, kinda nice. To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. Maybe a little less floral and a little more citrus or wood would have made a big (positive) difference.",05/22/13 07:21,aray
Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"Lovely and fresh, but I can dupe this with many aqua scented shower gels. I enjoyed my test spray, but it falls short of being a signature scent.

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"A very dry and crispy scent. There is a sharp note in it that seriousely bothers me like rotten apples or something. Also, the cucumber here isn't very great. It actually turned sour on me. Overall i don't think this is a feminin scent. And personally i don't want to smell anything like this, for fear of offending anyone near me with the smell of sour apples.

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"I'm a big fan of the freshness of ""aquatic"" and ""ozone"" fragrances, and haven't really hit anything as good as my old 80's favoriate ""New West"" by Aramis. So when this was advertised, I was really excited and couldn't wait to get my hands on a bottle!! I love CKone, but it was a little too ambiguous sexually for me, I have been holding out for something special for a long time, making do with ""Acqua di Gioia"" in the meantime. So you are getting the picture of the fragrances I like...

Eternity Acqua is nice. Just that, nice. Even when you first spray it, the fragrance isn't strong at all, it just smells astringent. After two or three minutes, you get a vague scent of ozonic sea mixed with green wood. Then that's it. Done. It's got less staying power than a 16 year old boy on his first date!!! Honestly, by the time I've sprayed it on my skin and clothes, brushed my teeth and walked down the stairs the fragrance is gone. Even layering with the body lotion doesn't seem to give it any more staying power. I have to ask if anyone likes it, and they have to lean in and practically rub their nose on my skin to smell anything!!! The answer is usually ""smells fresh, like soap or laundry softener"". Not the effect I've been after So, I'm back to Acqua di Gioia - which at least I get compliments on!!",04/26/13 02:38,kidsitaly1996

Eternity Aqua for Women Calvin Klein,"I was able to test this jem in the Mall yesterday and was quite impressed.A very nice, clean, aquatic scent,not a marine,though.It starts fruity with apricots and apple,but is not exactly juicy,the cucumber gives freshness,while the apple instead of making the composition crispy,gave it a little tartness,which makes it quite unique into my eyes.Then the white floral came out .I sprayed a lot of the perfume on me and also sprayed on a piece of paper.Well,it mixed quickly with my body chemistry,so after may be 10 min.I wasn't able to smell it any more on me.But the scent remained on the paper.I can actually still smell it from it.Apparently it is mostly the drown-down which is a very pleasant cedar,mixed with woodsy motes and not too much musk.I am planing to buy it,but right now is quite pricey-$54 for 1.7fl.oz and $74 for 3.4.I'll wait for a better offer or if they decide to make sets.I love the perfume,but in this bad economy,I'd rather shop wisely.",06/22/12 17:20,goldpoint

Eternity Calvin Klein,"A delicate, fresh, elegant, classic, aromatic, musky perfume that evokes a feeling of freshness and cleanliness, like after a shower, perfect for this upcoming summer. An old perfume, created in 1988, but completely timeless. Eternity is a type of perfume that has evolved and aged very well.
A perfume that has a sweetness of cleanliness and white floral notes very present here. It's a floral, with an aromatic opening, with green notes, which doesn't bother me at all, as it's all very well done. And then comes the white floral note, which I'm completely in love with, and which takes over this perfume, with lots of jasmine, freesia, and lily. This floral note gives it the characteristic of a clean, transparent, fresh, slightly soapy, and very striking perfume.
A perfume that earns compliments and is totally versatile, to be used on any occasion.

Eternity Calvin Klein,"I absolutely love this fragrance. It’s a beautiful green, clean floral that makes me feel so fresh and happy whenever I wear it.

The violet is super prominent on me, it gives off such a lovely powdery vibe to the perfume which makes it feel softer and not too floral. I saw some other reviews say it has an almost tea scent to it which I totally get! It’s an almost green tea note somewhere mixed in and it’s so pretty. I wear this as a daily perfume a lot as it’s perfect for daytime occasions, I’m not too sure I would wear this as an evening fragrance though as I don’t think it suits that vibe.

I highly recommend if you are looking for a fresh, floral fragrance that is perfect for everyday wear.",07/19/25 15:49,Mymble

Didn’t wear this in the ‘90s and wish I had. Has the distinctive, fantasy universe, fruit and flower tea base that is Sophia Grojsman’s trademark. She rules that domain. Eternity adds fresh, sweet-green, citrusy, round, lush, and miraculously spicy to her magical tea thing. The mix is beautiful.

This fragrance deserves way higher marks than it seems to be getting here — trends don’t interest me, just art, interest, fun, and beauty and Eternity checks those boxes. Enjoying the hell out of wearing this. It’s fun, a lot of fun.",07/13/25 15:13,MyleeMK

Eternity Calvin Klein,"I have both the OG formulation and the new one. I shall describe them thusly.

The original Eternity is the OG Karen of all the vintage fragrances. Loud. Entitled. In your face. Smelling of citrus. Demanding attention from the management. She requires extra lemon in her water. Then, she morphs into some kind of weird, sweetish pipe tobacco smell that lingers for days on your clothes or whatever zip code was invaded during her visitation. In the end, no flowers detected here, only vitriol.

The new iteration is an elderly version of Karen after she broke her hip and went to the nursing home. She can’t wander freely about the premises, but she can still run her mouth, make demands of the staff, and guilt her children and grandchildren into visiting her. Whereupon they will once more smell the weird tobacco essence, just less strong and now accompanied by a vague white floral-ness.

OG Karen is insufferable. Elderly Karen is much nicer to wear. I’m not at all sorry that this has been reformulated. Regardless, I hate them both based on my personal preferences, but I must say the OG version was truly a revelation in its time.",06/12/25 05:47,amrlittle
Eternity Calvin Klein,"The opening is crisp, citrusy, almost dry. Over time, it softens into a lightly floral, perhaps subtly powdery direction.

Eternity Calvin Klein,"Spring florals. Lots and lots of spring florals. It's like you are wearing a spring floral bouquet on your skin.

It's not like 24 Faubourg, which also smells like lots of spring florals. But 24 Faubourg smells like the inside of a florist shop and quite hyacinth heavy. It has green stems in the scent profile, which Eternity has not.

In comparison Eternity has more of a freesia and carnation dominant floral bouquet scent profile (rather than hyacinth and green stems). So it's equally mega floral, but more of a floral bouquet rather than a flower shop (as it doesn't have that cut stems note).

Very lovely, very appropriate for spring and summer. It has a lovely freshness to it.
If you don't mind gardenia (which can sometimes come across as ""vintage"" smelling) and you'll love spring florals then you'll love it.",04/19/25 07:55,Lebkuchen
Eternity Calvin Klein,"Floral perfumes are one of my favorites so I had to try this one obviously. Unfortunately, it’s too cold for me and has a note I cannot describe that is off putting. Kinda a sweaty skin smell? It was weird, I felt like I haven’t showered for a while, a bit embarrassing.
Carnation and freesia are really strong in this one and leave a noticeable trail.
To my surprise, it’s a beast mode floral. I haven’t met any other floral with such a great longevity. After 12 hours I could still smell a cloud around me and that’s impressive.
Apparently my skin chemistry and Eternity don’t work well together, so I have to give it off.
I recommend checking it out anyway if you like green, fresh florals.",04/17/25 05:16,Punika

Eternity Calvin Klein,"This didn’t just belong to your mom. It belonged to everyone’s. Which automatically etches it as “momsy” in my scent memory and makes me wanna flinch a little.

It opens like an overzealous florist’s shop at 8 a.m. on Mother’s Day. Carnation, freesia, violet, heliotrope, God knows what else. All so fresh, loud, explosive, borderline unhinged. There’s a vintage-dusted spice beneath the florals too, and it grabs you by the blouse and doesn’t let go.

It’s the kind of fragrance that owns spring, but on a hot and humid summer day? It doesn’t wear. It smothers. 💀

It’s drama. It’s volume. It’s Calvin Klein convincing women they could have it all, including a migraine in a bottle.

Would I wear it? Hell no. But I respect it for what it is: a powdered relic from the cocaine-chic decade when video killed the radio star and Sophia Grojsman said, “Florals? Let’s go nuclear.”

It's the kind of a fragrance that forms a soft floral cloud around you. Super ethereal. A bit powdery. A bit of patchouli and woody notes to form a base for the beautiful airy bouquet. Smells like walking through the garden, well balanced, this can never go out of style. My new go-to spring x summer office siren scent. Price is amazing for the longevity. Truly iconic.",03/20/25 15:37,zuzana_na
Eternity Calvin Klein,"Smells like pickled olives to me. Makes me crave feta, pickled green olives, and fried pickles from Buffalo Wild Wings. I'd hate to smell like this, but whenever I have that craving for acidic comfort food, I dab this on and feel better.

Smells like you dropped a jar of pickled green olives all over the flower arrangements in the wedding aisle and a bit of it got on the bride's dress, leaving a yellow-green stain that's just green enough for people to know it's not urine. Maybe that's the green notes in this, cuz believe me- it does smell green. The sourness of the olives, from the juice, and in the face of the furious Bridezilla dominate this scent experience, but there are definitely some pretty flowers in the background, sullied by the splash. Acidity, flowers, and disappointment on a big day.

Eternity Calvin Klein,"this shall be a strange story. but I'll give explanations where I can. I know this perfume well. my perfume career started in 1974 and in 1980 I was 23 years old. so I have lived the 1980s to the fullest. which means, for the queer half of a twin with my straight twinbrother, that he loved gent's scents and I immediately decided they were nothing for me, in 1974 that is. now when the 1980s started this would prove for me the most prominent decade of perfumery (while I wasn't aware of that then). now Calvin Klein offered in 1985 one of the three baddest hookers of the infamous 1980s Obsession. she was accompanied by Chanel Coco, Dior Poison and Giorgio Beverly Hills. these were my kind of perfumes. and my mother loved them too, to the detriment of my poor father with his excellent nose... Eternity then came in 1988, in 1989 'Giorgio Beverly Hills Red'. also in 1988 you had Estée Lauders Knowing. further Moschino parfum de toilette, Chistian Lacroix C'Est la Vie, YSL's Opium (1977) and Paris a sharp rose perfume (lovely). I could go on with name-dropping but this is my purpose: these were not perfumes but chemical warfare. these were code 4 Alarmist Presentist perfumes which took up the space and asphyxiated everyone. and so did Eternity and I loved it. but things can go strange. I smelled it then, but with the overload of perfumes which I actually bought and used, and bought for my mother, Eternity somehow managed to stay out of reach. I loved it but found it also as strong as it was, 'unchangeable'. then Calvin Klein launched Escape while Dior launched Dune, which I both didn't liked so much. I think they anticipated the aquatic, ozonic, clean, fresh 1990s, trends which I loathed. now I must move FFW. a couple of years back, while this Dutch perfumery already didn't caught up on Calvin Klein, there it was: a box between the gleaming new launches and 'fruitchoulis' and Bulgari - Prada - Lancôme - Chloe etc attention grabbers, there stood this old box with Eternity, completely unexpected and out of place, and of an old Edition pre-Reformulation. and I bought it while it wasn't even downprized (I never cared for prices while I just was a nurse with a common salary). but I mean, this artefact, where did it came from and what did it stood there in a bit dirty whitish with grey edge box.... to hell with facts, I had the perfume and it was smashing. now I did move on with the times but measure each perfume to the 1980s hooker perfumes, but in 2003 Montale came with his screechy Rose-Ouds which I all loved. in the aquatic 1990s some of the most vile and heady, floral, wilthed, indolic, Rose Prerogative perfumes were launched. in 1990s Gale Hayman Beverly Hills, a civet bomb which seemed to encompass all the witches of the 1980s together. also in 1990 (or thereabouts) Donna Karan by Donna Karan, Vivienne Westwood's Boudoir, in 2000 Guerlains Mahora (the Maison already in the 1980s offered Nahéma) and vCleef & Arpels Gem and (1970s) First, Oscar de la Renta Oscar (1980s). but the aquatic Air and Sea and Fresh and Clean 1990s decade I could come yet through with what I had gathered. now the strange event of finding a flacon Eternity, an older one, lost on the shelves. I so so love this perfume. but its composition is (not) entirely, but different from what I thought. I thought it is a White Flower perfume with a bunch of Tuberose. only NOW I see what Sophia Grojsman did. Freesia, Carnation, Lily, Lily of the Valley, Rose, Jasmine, Violet, Marigold, Heliotrope, THIS was the flower assault. but it was also ala Giorgio, Giorgio Beverly Hills Red, Estees Beautiful and Knowing, the somewhat other directed Poison and Obsession, like Moschino, Paris and Y (a 1970s Chypre from YSL for WOMEN), these were all ANNEXATIONIST perfumes which assaulted entire restaurants and Airplanes with flowers, Musks, Ambers, Plum and Peach, of course aromachemicals and what a decade that was. I am so glad to have learned to know Eternity, be it a little late to the party but with the original perfume. she is as sure a devils sister as all the other gals of that era. I am riddled by the composition but it is sheer genius. now do I smell the flowers separately and it is bit of mysterious perfume while it also is AS LOUD AS HELL as I then wanted perfumes to be and still wants them to hover around me. all that time, say in 40 years, I bought all kind of perfumes (I love Chanel No5, Coco, No19, Coco Mademoiselle). Lancôme La Vie est Belle two flankers (by Dominique Ropion my favorite perfumer) LVEB Intensément and Iris Absolu, Flowerbomb, but also all kinds of niche perfumes Dusitas Oudh Infini, Terry de Gunzberg's Terryfic Oud and Terryfic Oud Extrême. but now I discovered Eternity has withstand the time and holds its Allure Super Féminin high and on top ! finally we're there.",02/26/25 01:56,jaguarundina
Eternity Calvin Klein,"I never wore this fragrance back in the day, but I recently purchased it to cover my bases in my Calvin Klein collection. There’s something a bit herbal in the opening and not necessarily in a pleasant way. Luckily, it didnt last long for me. The floral notes started coming out and almost a citrus soapy scent. I looove “clean girl” scents so this is right up my alley! I ended up enjoying it so much more! After a couple hours, it ended up sitting very close to the skin. It’s there, but you have to sniff it out. I feel like it’s a good scent for spring and summer, it’s feminine, light and airy. If you need a pretty scent for spring and summer, this is lovely, and a great price! I would consider this to be timeless and one that most people would enjoy!",02/23/25 21:27,Ismellgood2024
Eternity Calvin Klein,"Back when perfumers had control over their product and were allowed to use various notes and ingredients because perfume releases were only every couple of years. Not anymore. It's like brands tell perfumers-were on a budget and I only want you to use max 9 notes, ok? Make it great! Sell, sell, sell! I would say this is much more ambery than the color bars display. It's not Obsession, but it's not as green and fresh as the bars would have me believe if I hadn't already smelled this 500x. This was a very popular perfume and my SIL and my sister's SIL wore this. The longevity, projection, and silage are VERY strong on this. It has a definitive perspective and it's a nice perfume. When it was ok for a perfume to be what it was-a perfume.",01/19/25 16:06,Blossomlove
Eternity Calvin Klein,"This was my favorite back in the ’90s. My boyfriend at the time even got me the real perfume for my birthday—a tiny bottle on a satin sheet in a square little box. As I’m growing old (I suppose), this wave of blue nostalgia for my old favorites has started to bother me, so I decided to order this elixir again.

On the first (and second, third, and so on) sniff, it smells exactly as I remember. But oddly enough, today it reminds me of dusty, grayish curtains in a heavy smoker’s kitchen. It’s strange because I remember it as a clean fragrance—a scent of a crisp white shirt and simple jeans.

I can’t decide whether I like it or dislike it. But one thing is certain: it has definitely lost its longevity.",01/19/25 10:45,Bunny Haimovits

Eternity Calvin Klein,"My mom always used this on me after I showered when I was a kid and it’s really nostalgic to me, I still use it till this day after showering or for a nice light bedtime fragrance!

Definitely recommend this for a simple clean and fresh feel. Andddd it’s affordable!",12/18/24 13:33,waldorfz
Eternity Calvin Klein,"Light fresh floral scent that's also kinda clean. It's a safe buy since it's not too crazy. My friend's have mixed reactions, some like it while others think it smells like shampoo(?) or they're just a fan of all the florals.",12/11/24 10:33,val3ntine.m
Eternity Calvin Klein,"Got a sample of this in a large sample pack. I saved the scents I was least interested in for last. The bottom two were Flowerbomb and this. I sprayed Flowerbomb on my left wrist: smells like the mall in 2012. Insanely basic and sweet. I sprayed this on my right wrist: This is what I would envision the best therapist ever to smell like. Calming, clean, mature, well-rounded. Although it is from the 80's, this could be worn by anyone after their teen years and not smell out of place. This could actually be a great signature scent for someone in Gen Z who did not grow up smelling this on adults in their lives and therefore do not have an association with older women. Really a well-blended, lovely perfume.",12/09/24 23:30,allieferraro
Eternity Calvin Klein,"I have a vintage sample vial. Sweet lilies and patchouli. Big 80’s floral vibes. At first the notes were competing. As it dried, the notes softened and blended. I love florals. Eventually the patchouli was too strong for me, but my nose is sensitive to it. I think my mom will love this. She’s a fan of Lauren, White Linen, Red Door, Realities, etc.

Edit: I’ve since tried a more recent sample vial. White florals and sweet violet. I didn’t notice the patchouli at all. I recognized this as a fragrance my mom wore to work back in the early 90’s. I like the flowers but there has always been a note that seems sickly to me - almost makes me nauseous. Maybe the sweet violet. I don’t know.",12/07/24 15:28,FlowerSeeker
Eternity Calvin Klein,"For myself, it's not unpleasant. However, it's nothing unique or special
It's a very safe fragrance and reminds me of the unwanted 'Ted Baker W"" perfume I received as a gift. These smells aren't bad; just on myself, smell very green and rather masculine. Also, rather weak smelling. Great for the office- boring and safe...",11/13/24 02:25,Biggest.Nose
Eternity Calvin Klein,A perfect clean crisp floral fragrance with a slight coldness to it. Somehow despite this it has it's own identity which renders it unique. This is beautifully refreshing. The carnation is very strong in this but I personally love that what is otherwise a cold clean floral has a kick of spice. It definitely smells like a Sophia Grojsman fragrance and reminds me a lot of a Estee Lauder White Linen but without the aldehyde lemon combination.,10/17/24 22:58,elusiveviktoria
Eternity Calvin Klein,"An important and beloved woman whom I consider as a mother gave this perfume to me. I love perfumes and receiving it as a gift has my heart. I've wore it multiple times.

Eternity Calvin Klein,"They should rename this scent to ""Virgin Curse"" by Calvin Klein. It gave me an intense headache almost immediately after spray, and I think it's because I don't have the purity or class to wear a scent with this much lily and jasmine. Lol.

I'm primed to dislike a perfume like this because it contains almost all notes I dislike, but I do think this is gorgeous. It's a beautiful fragrance other than the migraine. I don't get any citrus notes at all, and I think with a little bit of brightness I'd like this a lot more. The dry down is nicer. I really can't tell how long-lasting it is because I think my brain filtered it out as fast as it could because it was so overwhelming, but I have to imagine that lasts for perhaps... an eternity?",09/07/24 11:18,cupidrot
Eternity Calvin Klein,I got this perfume in a sample variety from Amazon. I like it but not enough to purchase a full size. I didn't get many compliments but is you like florals you will love this,08/27/24 11:46,kch1
Eternity Calvin Klein,Such a classic scent! My mom has worn this for decades and it just always smells elegant. Now I wear it and I just love it. I can't identify the specific notes but it's very obviously a green/floral scent. I would say it's a bit more mature but blended nicely. To me personally it works best in all seasons except summer. The scent is perceived differently based on weather but it works for most seasons even though it seems to be a more spring oriented perfume. Also an affordable perfume and the bottle looks nice in my collection.,08/13/24 21:18,Adenahi
Eternity Calvin Klein,"It smells classy and elegant. Although it's an older perfume, to me it doesn't smell dated. I'd say a bit mature but not quite. It's soapy, green, floral, powdery. Smooth yet bright and vibrant. I like to layer it with Flower by Kenzo.",08/08/24 14:14,luanneog

The one made in USA smells exactly like it should and how I remember it, potent, long lasting and huge silage. The one made by Coty, is boring like water, cheap watered down version, hardly anything to smell and disappears from skin within 2- 3 hours . A disaster 👎🏼",07/15/24 02:02,Goofy79

Reminds me more of college than HS. I love it. Spicier than I was anticipating, a little powdery, i definitely don’t think this is dated if you weren’t there. Smells less powdery than a lot of the current perfume offerings. It smells like my idea of a proper perfume, if that makes sense. Classic. Not gourmand or atmospheric. The only note I can identify without a question is the carnation. I tend to like most of CK’s creations, though.",07/14/24 13:34,Roses and Thyme
Eternity Calvin Klein,"I first wore this in 1990 and I recall how different it was for me after a decade of über spicy orientals. I still occasionally wear a little travel spray of it but it’s more for a trip down memory lane. It’s beautiful, strong and classic but likely not for most. It doesn’t have the sweetness or darkness people seem to crave these days. While it was kinda of a freshie back in the day, it’s classier and more sophisticated by today’s standards.",07/10/24 09:10,MidWestMama
Eternity Calvin Klein,"Timeless classic, one of THEE most beautiful, feminine, floral scents ever created, truley masterful perfumery.

The scent is unmistakable, original and no other parfume comes to mind when its time for comparisons. I only WISH that the original ( Pure Parfume Splash) was still available.
Now that version reveals the TRUE vision Sophia Grojsman had when she created this classic, timeless beauty!
My mom would go nuts if I could get my hands on that concentration, but alas.. she's settled for the eau de parfume and still loves it.. close enough I suppose..

Eternity Calvin Klein,"I love the Calvin Klein brand and iconic bottle for this perfume, so really wanted to like this more.

There’s nothing wrong with it, just isn’t my sort of scent. I have the flanker, Eternity Moment and prefer the flirty, sweet, lightheartedness of that much more.

Opens with very sharp green notes, then turns quite soapy on my skin. I can smell spicy base notes as well but they’re subtle. There’s also a bit of smokiness too, which I dislike. Would suit colder weather.

For some reason Eternity reminds me of Chanel No 5. The reformulation for No 5 was released around the same time. It doesn’t open in the same way as No 5 and isn’t as strong but those soapy notes are dominant.",05/26/24 07:55,Louise1984

Eternity Calvin Klein,"I’m not really a big Calvin Klein fan, having discovered so after being gifted a few mini sizes from a variety pack. But of the bunch I’ve got (Ck One, Euphoria, Euphoria Blossom, Sheer Beauty, Eternity) I think Eternity is my favourite. The green and citrus top notes help to round the florals out, and I do get a lot of jasmine on the dry down. It’s a sharp, punchy spring fragrance with decent staying power. I like to layer with it for evening wear (Euphoria + Lush’s Vanillary for a touch of sweetness work really well together). It’s not an everyday fragrance for me but I have surprised myself by reaching for it a few times this spring.",05/16/24 20:11,chelseanadine

Green grass and freesia. Very airy.
I'm noticing some violet is adding a dry, slightly screechy, chalky texture that I'm not loving.

It's easy, unisex, and pleasant enough. Breezey, potent and ready to be splashed on.

I'm finding that it smells quite dated to me... and I just can't get around the SPF note, I find it a bit unpleasant.
It's like the bottom of my mum's beach bag in the early 2000s.

Eternity Calvin Klein,"I got the new bottle recently, because i missed the scent i had in high school. It was my best friend's signature and she talked me into getting a bottle for myself - i was not into scents in that time. I was actually surprised now, i didnt hear anything about reformulation of this one, but i'm pretty sure something changed. It doesnt last and seems more diluted in generał, but above that it's just different. It's hard to point out exactly what changed but it just has less of this ""powdery quality"" that it always had for my nose. It is still recognizable, but definitely different. I actually managed to find my old bottle from around 2014 in my family house. I can't wait to compare them side-by-side. But i'm a bit disappointed with the one i got recently.

Edit. They definitely changed it, comparing to my bottle from around 2014. It's pretty disappointing",03/30/24 15:24,Velvetta
Eternity Calvin Klein,I remember being so captured by the ads for this fragrance. The campaign was brilliant. I smelled it as a teenager and hated it. Now as a middle age woman I thought I would revisit Eternity to see if I had changed or if Eternity had changed. Eternity smells just as I remember. And I still do not like it. I should. It has many of my favorite florals but somehow this comes off aquatic to me. Like the smell of a very watery and thin lotion. It almost reminds me of the smell of Oil of Olay the old kind with the pink color. I also get the melon note so strongly. It smells putrid. I will never understand why this is so popular. Probably because of the beautiful ad campaign. Aquatic rotten melon floral cheap lotion.,03/18/24 14:17,LSAUG
Eternity Calvin Klein,"I usually don’t like the classic and old perfume but this one is so lovely.
I strongly dislike patchouli in fragrances but I feel like in this one in blends so beautifully with other notes that it does’t even register to my nose.

Beautifully herbal, floral and clean, perfect for spring and summer.",03/17/24 06:05,Candylover666
Eternity Calvin Klein,"what a classic! 'eternity' was my mother's old signature, which i didn't realize until after i bought and started wearing this 🤡. i do love this scent and have been trying (somewhat successfully) to reassociate it with more positive things.

i love bright, warm floral scents like this. it's formal without being, like, authoritarian? while still maintaining an air of comfort around it. an older white woman fragrance for fucking sure. frankly iconic + dare i say set a standard?

my only real problem with this scent is that it doesn't last an 'eternity' on my skin. it only stays strong for around 3 hours at the very most. disappointing! especially considering how i blew 80 dollars on it.",03/12/24 20:16,pinkmalady

Eternity Calvin Klein,"I am not a fan of CK, but this one is an exception. I wore it in my teens and early 20s, so it holds lots of memories for me. Most importantly, I detect lily of the valley, which is one of my favorite scents in the world. Eternity is a classic, clean, smooth, and vibrant scent. Youthful and fresh without being too immature or girly. A mood booster with major light feminine vibes, gracious, radiant, sparkling. Good for any occasion, including for work, as its presence is noticeable but not overpowering, not screaming for attention. Great durability and sillage for a fresh floral, very affordable price.",02/21/24 03:18,IVamp

Eternity Calvin Klein,"A superb floral fragrance of mostly a photorealistic stargazer lily note, sweet freesia + narcissus, and spicy accents of carnation; with a photorealistic, green note of lily of the valley plus other crisp, аldehydic green notes. Eternity then evolves into musk, with a quite powdery floral violet note coming forward. The drydown maintains lilies, carnation, violet, musk and amber, predominantly. There's a light incense feel in the background (the combination of amber, dry sandalwood, musk, and powderiness) which cements Eternity's vintage status. I imagine this pretty, clean, slightly sweet classic floral pairing perfectly with flowy white linen drawstring trousers and tank top. Or a crisply starched and ironed white button down shirt tucked into high waisted vintage Calvin Klein jeans. Just a sweet, almost virginal, vintage vibe here.",12/17/23 19:07,Autumnal Elf

Eternity Calvin Klein,"It's a warm, spicy, musky, floral scent, with a bit of sweetness. I don't get a lot of green notes from this, just a tiny bit that doesn't really stand out to me. It smells strong at first, but most of the floral notes dissipate really quickly on me. Within 3 hrs, only a much weaker sweet, warm, spicy musk remains, with a slightly more noticeable soapy, powdery smell, but not much floral is detectable. It becomes so faint after the 3 hour mark that you'd have to put your nose almost directly on my skin to smell it. I'm really not impressed by the longevity. Some might say it smells mature, but I would say it's a lot weaker than other fragrances I'd put in the same ""mature"" category of warm spicy sweet fragrances like Prada Paradoxe, Lancome La Vie Est Belle, Lancome Tresor, YSL Opium, Mugler Elixir, YSL Libre, Marc Jacobs Perfect Intense, etc. It just lacks longevity compared to the ones I listed.",11/12/23 08:07,rachelv

Eternity Calvin Klein,"Another inexplicably low-scored Grojsman fragrance that I am quite enjoying. It smells clean and a little sharp and green; one part clean laundry, one part white lily, fresh narcissus, and mildly spicy marigold and carnation. The heliotrope and clean musks in the base confer a certain fluffiness that keeps everything from coming off too pointy or screechy. I never wore Eternity back when it was popular, and I probably wouldn't have picked this up if I were not going through a mild Grojsman kick of late. This is remarkably different from Eternity Intense, which reminds me of chocolate irises and doesn't smell ""clean"" at all. I know that this perfume has supposedly suffered in the decades of reformulations by lesser brands, but I don't think I would want this to smell any stronger than it is. It seems like it is more than pulling its olfactory weight. This is a fragrance for when you want to smell scrubbed, tidy, and crisp--maybe when you're meeting a banker or interviewing a new nanny. In the spirit of full disclosure, I have never done either and probably never will, but at least I have the appropriate fragrance, should such an occasion arise. Today I'm wearing Eternity to a Zoom meeting with a designer who lives halfway across the country, and any effect it produces will be solely on myself. My hope is that it will make me feel more competent and capable. Aspirational fragrance: is there any other kind?",11/02/23 09:08,rene.saller

Eternity Calvin Klein,"I grew up in a small town in the 90’s, and while the rest of the world was swimming in a cloud of clean musks and boisterous florals, my corner of space didn’t have access to any of it. Once in a while, you would come across someone wearing “scent” though - we didn’t call it perfume. Sometimes it would be pretty and soft, but most of the times it would be loud and offensive.

The funny thing is, despite not having smelled any of the perfumes from the 90’s during the 90’s, each time I smell one now, I am taken right back to my childhood. Maybe some cheap dupes had trickled their way to our local markets after all? Or maybe it was just the vibe.

Eternity was one of those scents that immediately felt familiar, even though I am sure I had never smelled it before. At first whiff, I get the spice, clove to be precise, even if there is no clove listed. Maybe it is the carnation? It is crisp and clean, and doesn’t feel warm - yet. Slowly but surely, the bouquet of flowers come into play - vibrant, almost sparkling. Like dew soaked blooms in a cold winter morning. The glitter and shine never leaves the scent - but instead mellows down because of heliotrope, musk and sandalwood, while amber makes it warm. Despite that this doesn’t turn creamy or lotion like. It retains its soapy freshness, like someone fresh out of shower. Something about it reminds me of L’eau D’Issey but while L’eau D’Issey has that signature melon note that people either love or hate that makes it sweet, this one retains its clean green scent with very little sweetness.

I would wear this with a white tee and jeans. Or a white dress. Or a white shirt. You get the drift. This truly is such a pristine scent. Longevity, despite being a clean scent, is impressive. I get whiffs each time I move, or reach out my arm to get something. I smell it on my pillow the next day (I always spray the nape of my neck) and even though I am yet to spray on my clothes, I know this will last forever on them.

So is it still relevant in 2023? Heck yes. Because does smelling clean and green ever go out of style? If you’re looking to smell unique in today’s world of sweetened white florals, grab this one. You really won’t regret it.",09/09/23 00:35,ssamhita
Eternity Calvin Klein,Yes Eternity smells different now compared to the original. I think the main reason has to do with the Sandalwood. They are either using cheaper variant or substituted with chemicals.,08/22/23 22:46,Let_it_be
Eternity Calvin Klein,"Eternity for women is definitely a throw back to a bygone era. The 80’s and early 90’s were when powerhouse fragrances slapped everyone across the face, and no one seemed to even notice, never mind MIND.

I recently picked up a CK mini sample box, and Eternity was included. Whew... that opening is syrupy-sweet florals. I personally do not care for this opening, at all - but I can see how some would really interpret it as pleasing.

That opening lasted maybe 30 minutes, and then the middle was more tame. This is when I asked my husband if he liked it, and his eyebrows went up and he he enthusiastically said: “Yes! I do!”. This is telling because he typically just says a fragrance is “ok”.

I didn’t enjoy it until the full dry down. The super-charged sweet floral finally came down and the screech was gone. It’s ok for me.",08/20/23 17:35,katiejon

Eternity Calvin Klein,"2023
As I am collecting notable scents of my life, the Eternity has its sure place on my shelf. I remember the craze around it in the early 90-ies: seemed like everybody was wearing it.

I did too, and to me it smelled like turning pages of a freshly minted Vogue. Until one funny guy at a party compared it to a famous Soviet eau de cologne (одеколон) Сarnation (gvozdika). Wow! This had totally changed my perception of it. Up until now, it brings me the memories of a ubiquitous EDC ""Gvozdika"" that every mom was giving to her child to use as a bug spray. I love Eternity for this very reason as it brings me back to the pioneer camp of early eighties. For me it is carnation, carnation, carnation.",08/09/23 07:46,tterekhova
Eternity Calvin Klein,"You know that beach scene in 'From Here to Eternity,"" (1953) with Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr? This is what this perfume reminds me of, not because it's beachy, but it has a retro aquatic feel; elegant, classic, feminine, strong, yet understated with its smooth jade greenness.

I get a very prominent violet note here which makes me reference the original YSL Paris with the pink cap, and Balenciaga L'Essence. Violet always gives me watery vibes -- sweet, fat, romantic, melancholic dew drops. The spicy carnation radiates elegant heat; freesias add a hint of coy playfulness.

Amber, orange and sandalwood hint at a liquid gold sunset.

Sexy stuff, if retro beach fantasies are your thing!",08/07/23 12:45,Tigerlillian

Eternity Calvin Klein,"i do like this perfume! it’s citrusy and feminine whilst also being really mature and sophisticated. i only really get florals when i get to the base notes, the mid and top are very citrusy. i can smell the freesia, lily and lily of the valley throughout though. my first thought was that there could be frangipani but there isn’t which is really surprising since everyone i asked said they smelled it too! i think it’s really nice and won’t be easily cloying. it’s very 90s but also very mature and middle aged. it’s sophisticated! reminds me of a fancy elizabeth arden perfume your mother would wear to work or something like that. similar to dune by dior, not in scent but in feeling. okayish longevity, would have to top up after a few hours. good year round scent, especially in autumn! projection could be better",07/28/23 23:34,mabelangel

Eternity Calvin Klein,"Eternity smells just like that - like Eternity. Nostalgic, reminiscent of childhood, smells soapy and that's what makes it cozy.
I don't see smells through notes but through images and sensations, it evokes.
As someone mentioned before, it reminds me of my aunt as well - but in a good way - as she always channeled chic and style.
Many seem to disregard soapy smells - I do want to use smells that smell like fresh crisp elevating soap - full of light and brightness and space.
I love Santa Maria Novella's Rose Gardenia as it takes me to a bathtub somewhere in sunny Italy where the air is so clean the smell of soap makes it even softer. I love Diptyque's Do Son and the classic See by Chloe (sadly discontinued).

Eternity Calvin Klein,"Eternity has become my spring/summer signature years and years ago. The opening can be confusing because there's spicy citrus opening with sage and greens. Later it transforms and becomes powdery floral with carnation, rose and lilies being the main theme. It ballances on edge of being almost unisex but then at the end of the day it exudes the most feminine creamy scent of face cream and I am in heaven. You can wear it to work, date, wedding, red carpet event.",06/19/23 09:21,lynne2
Eternity Calvin Klein,"This was the first perfume my husband bought me, that was about 20 years ago. It was gift set with the large perfume, a travel perfume and body lotion. I still have it, except for the lotion. It hasn't turned colors and it still smells exactly the same. I love wearing this, it blends like a masterpiece with my body chemistry. Unfortunately, I had to stop wearing it. I had a coworker who sat hehind me ask me what I was wearing. Less than a week later she went and bought it and wore it everyday. I stopped wearing it. I know it wasn't made just for me but I can't stand for people to copy me. People think that's weird of me but I am an identical twin. I've shared most things for a big part of my life. When family, friends and acquaintances only know you as a twin it's hard to get from under that shadow....if that makes sense. But I digress. Where was I? Oh yes? This definitely has longevity and silage. I can smell it in me all day. Just whiffs of clean beautiful perfume all day. The smell of this is so unique it's hard to describe it. All I know is this perfume is clean, floral, powdery and delicious. I",06/17/23 01:06,Mycoleman2800
Eternity Calvin Klein,"This is spring and happiness in a bottle to me. Yes, it's very 90's, and yes, it reminds me of my favourite aunt - but it still doesn't make me feel like an aunt when I wear it, if that makes sense. Nostalgia aside, the carnation and narcissus really stands out to me, and I LOVE it. I think it's actually quite unique! It might even be the fragrance I've owned with THE best longevity, I can smell this on my clothes for days. It's turned out to be somewhat of a migraine trigger for me though, so these days I rarely use it, but I still adore it. It makes me feel clean, put together and optimistic.",06/01/23 14:16,Swagnoodle

Eternity Calvin Klein,"This is one is WAY too outdated ! I saw it at a store 3 days ago and decided to spray it on my skin..Oh lord! I instantly regretted it!, the smell is very pungent and it gave me headache within the next hour. If I could picture in my head the guy who wears this : this smells like the 90s douchebag wearing Timberlands and Aeropostale T-shirt with the huge freaking logo on the chest, and speaks on a Star-Tac. Atrocious.
I cannot understand how somebody would spent CAD $130 at a store (CAD $40 on discounters) for this, when for the same money anyone can get a modern, vibrant fragrance. Even if you wanted to re-purchase Eternity out of nostalgia I'd still suggest to try it on your skin for a few hours.",05/19/23 21:15,Jose Zerpa
Eternity Calvin Klein,"I'm changing my review of this. I don't like it. Even after getting really into floral perfumes this year and having always loved a ""granny"" perfume when the mood struck me, there's just something about this that I hate.
It's all flowers, no base notes to sweeten it up, I don't get any amber or woods. Just full on fresh white flowers and the kinda savoury smelling sage note. The florals aren't even sweet ones. For some people that'd be great but for me I like gourmands so when I do like a floral it's usually got something like vanilla and amber in the base. I even like powdery perfumes and don't care when a perfume was made, some of my favourite perfumes ever are 80s and 90s classics or even older ones.

This is better as a room or bedding spray. My 62 year old mother doesn't like it either, neither of us are into fresh, light, overly floral, citrus or aquatic scents. I didn't realise she'd had a full bottle for ages that my brother bought her because she never uses it.

I can appreciate the quality of it though and can see why it's a favourite for lots of you. It'd probably smell lovely on someone else. It just comes down to it not being my style. There is something comforting about it though, and it's strong, I can smell it for ages after spraying my room.

I recently bought a couple of Milton Lloyd perfumes, one of them being Monaco which is said to smell exactly like the original formulation of Paris by YSL and I find there's something similar in that. I prefer that one slightly though because it's got a much sweeter, airier feel and smells like parma violets. Eternity gets close to being something I'd like, and I thought I was starting to like it as it dried down but it stops just short of where I thought it was gonna go.",05/17/23 01:55,Melody Valentine
Eternity Calvin Klein,"Most of us know a lady who’s generally very good looking, sleek and well groomed but with one eccentric feature; a crooked or exceptionally big nose, a deep almost masculine voice or something of the sort. This feature renders her unique and she carries it with such grace and confidence, never wants to hide or change it, and for that you admire her and wish her confidence would rub more on you. (Sarah Jessica Parker, Barbara Streisand and Joyce Meyer come to mind). However, there will always be haters and jealous people who’ll only see and mention this one feature disregarding the caring heart, commitment, strong personality or success she has.
Eternity embodies this woman totally for me. The sharp green and spicy start (like you sprinkled loads of cloves and pepper on an already edgy carnation) precedes a very beautiful floral heart and a warm much softer base. Amazing perseverance and personality.
This book is not to be judged just by its cover. It’s a journey with a turning plot.
They don’t make them like this anymore. 💚",05/13/23 10:01,Tinabill
Eternity Calvin Klein,"I hated this perfume years and years and some how I change

Although modern perfumes have a different DNA today, this lovely fragrance isn't old. I don't even sense it like mature: no, it is airy, soft and pleasantly spicy.

Eternity Calvin Klein,"I was put off of this for a little while due to a colleague who doused themselves in this to the extent you could taste it 😂

Applied appropriately however, it is a classic (of course it is, it’s Calvin Klein and a Grojsman!). It smells like a lovely clean lotion to me. I was put off carnation in fragrances after hosing myself in Gloria Vanderbilt in my early teens but in this it is blended to perfection. The sandalwood also really grounds this and adds to the clean-ness, and I can definitely pick up the Lily and muguet in this. I think it could be muguet along the lines of Diorissimo (although it’s of course not a dupe) and the lily has the same clean, floral quality as it does in Gucci Bamboo.

I do think this could be worn by a man as well, and I’d love to try Eternity For Men as a comparison.

I have a travel bottle of Kayali musk that I’ve layered under this and it really softens it up, lovely combination.

To me it smells like a comforting mum-hug ❤️ It is definitely a compliment getter and signature-worthy. Can be picked up for an absolute steal in the U.K., even in the supermarket!

Inoffensive really if you like florals but it's hard to really pick out any specific notes. It doesn't project that well unless you use quite a bit.

I was standing next to a bunch of my scarves all hanging up in my closet and could smell the eternity wafting off them.

But now being a frag head and all, I need to dig deeper and see what notes I can smell: ) First there is citrus and there´s a lot of fresia going on. The patchouli is definitely there all along from the beginning, there's something peppery going on as well.

This is a beast mode perfume, 1-2 sprays are enough. Longevity on clothes for weeks. Sillage is mega: It stays in the room for hours and you can smell it when you enter even if you´re currently wearing it. I have to be careful not to overspray! I get compliments with just 1-2 sprays.

I don´t feel it´s dated but maybe people think so because of its uniqueness and their memories of it? I only wear this when I want to feel nostalgic.",09/17/22 04:01,CamillaAre
Eternity Calvin Klein,"It's a sweet, fresh woody fragrance suitable for the office, wedding and daily wear. The notes are well blended and I can't distinguish any particular note. The scent feels timeless and I can see this as a signature scent.",09/10/22 16:25,jil489
Eternity Calvin Klein,"I just want to point out something about how this was initially marketed. Eternity was introduced in the late 80s, so it maintains that ""everything but the kitchen sink"" approach used to create the big and bold creations one associates with that decade. It followed the great success of Obsession, which as the name suggests, was all about marketing it as a passionate, dangerous perfume of, well, obsession.
By the end of the 80s, the excesses of the decade were beginning to take there toll as the AIDS epidemic was ravaging the world and people began to realize that cocaine was not the innocuous party drug it was once thought to be. When the stock market crashed, it was almost as if someone declared that the party was over and it was time to go home, sober up, and become a responsible adult.
Enter Eternity, which through the power of marketing was presented as the polar opposite of Obsession. As the name suggests, this was all about commitment, monogamy, family, and purity. If someone smelt the original version today, my guess is that they would not guess that a fragrance this potent would have once been considered a return to ""family values"" and all that implies. Though much different than the freshies that dominated the 90s, the concept definitely ushered in that era. The rest, as they say, is history!
I know this isn't a review, but I thought it might be interesting to younger perfumistas to understand the history of the fragrance and how either marketing defines the zeitgeist or vice versa!",09/05/22 16:29,churinl

Eternity Calvin Klein,"I noticed the freesia right away. It seems as if it work well in the office because I don't find anything seductive or sensual about it. I notice that a number of people people have used the word unisex in their descriptions. To me it seems much too floral for that. (Then, perhaps, some men like to wear floral colognes.) What astounds me is that 18 (!!) fragrance notes are listed! 18?! They certainly come together nicely in ""Eternity"" to create a unique scent. Perhaps I am something of a purist, but I really prefer perfumes with fewer elements so that I can choose those in which my favorites stand out. I was searching for carnation and came across this one. It is included as a fragrance note, but, with the 17 others I can't find it. I just purchased a vintage 1/4 oz. bottle of ""Belodgia"" by Caron. (Extrait.) Now THERE'S carnation!",07/30/22 10:30,Anand PA

Not FBW for me, because it doesn't excite me, but it doesn't offend and i don't have any sideffects from the fragrance despite it being the strongest thing i currently own. I feel it's blended well and throws off a nice scent for everyday wear that's kept from being too floral by the green and sage notes. Simply put, i lean towards refined, or more subtle. This definitely feels 80s/90s to me.",07/28/22 10:07,kareninthevalley

Eternity Calvin Klein,"This is a beautiful scent - fresh and flowery with just a hint of peppery, herby, spiciness which stops it from being too sweet or screechy.
The first spray envelops you in a cloud of fresh flowers with a sparkling trail of loveliness. The drydown is exquisite, leaving you with a sweet and feminine skin scent. All in all a beautiful classic fragrance which firmly has a place in my top 5 of all time.",06/17/22 04:11,Jeanne de Valois
Eternity Calvin Klein,"I remember long ago spritzing this one once and being overwhelmed by spice. I was young and impatient and this was not for me. I’m older now. I understand that some things take time to develop and bloom. A lot of perfumes these days start out promising something beautiful upon initial spray that they can’t really deliver and they end up drying down all so very similar to each other… this is not that. In fact, this one is quite the opposite.
Coming back to this one -without a need for instant gratification- I really like it!
For me the initial spray spills everything out on the table. It’s thick humid dark green & deep spices heavy in cloves and pepper. It’s messy & almost masculine. It begins to settle on my skin giving a clearer view. What I thought was cloves and pepper shines brighter as sage and carnation. All the spicy carnation- to the point were I laugh at thinking it was anything else. It’s warm and spicy. Almost tickles the back of my throat- but pleasantly. Here it stays for a while. A creamy under layer of amber and heliotrope slowly soften the sharp peppery edges of the carnation. The musk is warm. The lilies begin to shine.
The way that this unfolds is captivating. What I smell from a distance smells nothing like what I get when I bury my nose to my skin. The cloud surrounding me is creamy vintage floral- when I get closer it’s spicy carnations.
It’s a shapeshifter. Not an easy reach or a blind buy. But gorgeous on days when you want to change it up a bit, keep things interesting & add some spice to your soapy florals.",06/09/22 10:44,ShaLion

Eternity Calvin Klein,"Eternity is a classic, one that I was happy to revisit and buy a big bottle of! I adore the smell and it is, at least on me, a powerhouse of a perfume! It lasts a long time and is a very clean and fresh smell. It is a welcome addition to my otherwise sweet or spicy perfumes. I wish I could smell the individual notes like a lot of others do but I can't, I just know that all together it is a gorgeous scent.",06/02/22 08:55,unicorn1
Eternity Calvin Klein,"On my skin, Eternity gives a fresh, ""clean bedsheets"" vibe, maybe because it's a bit soapy and floral, but fresh and citrusy at the same time. Light green is the color that I would associate with this scent.
It develops in a lemony dry fragrance, where I fail to detect the flowers anymore. It's true that Eternity is so fresh that it becomes pungent, almost bitter.

I can see why Calvin Klein decided that this represented love, family and peace, as it's a really bright, pure scent, extremely idealized.
Eternity does not represent the people involved in these values, nor the little things that make these values real.

It's quite a polarizing fragrance: either you like it or you don't, it's difficult to be neutral to it.
I really wouldn't mind it in an aftershave, or as a male fragrance, but I fail to appreciate Eternity as a feminine scent, especially on myself. Unfortunately, it reminds me of (high quality) cleaning products for clothes.",05/30/22 12:00,Lady Nightshadow
Eternity Calvin Klein,"I'm mystified by the love for Eternity. I know perfume is a subjective thing but I can't detect anything of the stated notes or any positive description in the smell.
To me, it just smells like a one note weird chemical assault. Nothing floral, nothing natural.
I used to work with a woman who wore it and it filled the lab we worked in, totally overbearing.
I'm not a 'troll', I have pretty old fashioned perfume tastes, in general, so I'm not accusing Eternity of being 'mature' or anything like that, I don't even get 'powdery', I'm sorry I just think it's horrible!
How it relates to marriage or fidelity is again, mystifying.

Eternity Calvin Klein,At first sniff I was not a fan it smelled like a bomb of powder and nothing else was detectable. Once it settled in after a few minutes it was very nice a light soft bed of flowers after spring rain (maybe roses). After an hour I started getting the spice and the patchouli still can smell the roses though. All in all this is a good scent and I normally HATE powdery scents but in my opinion the powder does not stick around long. For me this scent reminds me of this natural perfume I once bought from a small creator called ghost of the Knoxville girl. Smells like roses after rain with a pinch of spice. Very light and not offensive I got this for Christmas and thought I would dislike it ( I’m in my twenties and love strong scents) but I do enjoy this.,05/13/22 07:59,Compostflower
Eternity Calvin Klein,"When I first received this perfume as a gift, I was taken aback by the strong green notes that hit me immediately. My initial impression was not favorable, and I was a bit hesitant to continue using it. However, as it dried down, the fragrance transformed into something truly beautiful and refreshing.

One of the standout features of this perfume is its impressive sillage - it has a strong projection and can last all day. As I continued to use it, it quickly became one of my favorites, especially during the winter months when I often layered it with a warm fragrance.

Interestingly, I also found that it worked well when paired with a soft floral scent during the spring and summer. This combination garnered many compliments, and I was frequently asked about the fragrance I was wearing. Overall, I'm very happy to have this perfume in my collection and highly recommend giving it a chance despite its initially strong green notes.",05/12/22 18:41,RH2ME

Eternity Calvin Klein,"Eternity is a pleasant if generic floral. It's crowd-pleasing, easy to understand, not ""too"" anything, nothing surprising, ""strong"" or offensive. Good for a female who has classic, soft, spring-floral sort of taste in perfume, or who needs an office scent on the femme side. It's pretty, easygoing, smells great, and is the sort of thing you would wear to an Easter family gathering, brunch, the office barbecue, or a casual date. You would gift it to your boyfriend's mum for Mother's Day, or your 15-year-old niece for Christmas, and you'd get good reactions back. I might wear it once in a while, but only in an environment where I wanted to blend in, be a lovely-smelling ""nice lady"" who has Family Values, and be taken for a lot less dangerous than I am.

Friends, please be aware that there are trolls on Fragrantica too . . . people who post fake reviews to try to ruin other peoples' pleasure in their perfume collections. These people make absurd, outlandish claims that the perfume--the more classic and enjoyed, the better--actually smells like something disgusting (or something you would never want to smell like): urinal cakes, tar soap, plastic dolls, vomit, sandwich condiments, wet dog, breakfast cereal, cleaning solvents, and so on. They hope that once you read their nonsense, you will lose your joy in your treasured scents, and you will smell what they have suggested, instead.

Positives:
The bottle is pretty, nice spray, lasts a long time, pretty affordable.
Cons:
On my skin it's totally unisex(I prefer typical feminin scents). Eternity smells like Nivea lotion and soap, not Dove soap, rather Marseilles soap bar (to wash clothes), I'm gonna give it to my fiancé, he won't even notice it's for women 😏

I was staring at her all admiration but what really took my breath away was her perfume! Thats how it smelled on her. Cut fresh spicy rose! Her perfume filled all the corridor. What a beautiful scent was that! I did everything on my power to find out what was that unforgetable scent. And it was this one.

I'm so sure new bottles have been REDUCED to water by now - the bottle I purchased has to be at least 30 years old at least .",03/05/22 21:15,Konga5000

Good for Casual and Formal occasions.
Surprisingly good for teenagers and adults as well

Eternity Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"I won't lie, I bought this because I found the bottle to be beautiful. I agree with the other reviewers who find the fragrance to be 'meh'. The first spray is an overwhelming floral scent. Immediate thoughts were, ""Oh no, what a waste of money!"" After it dried down, it smells so generic, like clean laundry. It has lasted about 30 minutes and is almost gone. I'm kicking myself for blind buying this one!",06/18/20 21:29,Ashalia
Eternity Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"OMG, so strange, with me this scent played a huge mental trick: it created scenes in my mind. Walking on the embankment around twilight (in summer, of course). Stepping outside right after the rain. Returning home after a late dinner and gazing at the stars. Receiving a bouquet of wild purple flowers. Smelling wisteria and thinking that it's magical. My conclusion is that every Summer Eternity tells us its own version of what summer is - and I appreciated this story the most.",06/15/17 22:11,Aromatyu
Eternity Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,What can I say? To me this is a very generic and boring scent nothing interesting very watery and non existent. I bought my nearly full 100ml bottle from eBay for £20 which in all honesty is not worth it. I have had cheap body sprays that have lasted a lot longer then this flanker. I expected more from Calvin Klein to be honest so I was greatly disappointed. I may forward this on to a friend or sell it I've not yet decided but I have decided not to wear this again as I don't see the point as it's unremarkable totally non existent fragrance. This flanker is good for anyone who doesn't want to be noticed and remain inconspicuous lol. I on the other hand like my fragrance to be noticed as it's lovely receiving compliments I enjoy it. If you can get it cheap give it a go but it's really more of a barely there body spray rather than a designer fragrance.,10/31/16 14:55,Seemi
Eternity Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"Just received this in the mail....smells very aquatic to me. I guess I didn't know what to expect- for some reason aquatics don't work well with my chemistry. I'll try it again as the weather warms up, but I expect this will be put up in eBay.
Edit: it smells like straight up soap, like fancy English soap you put in your guest room. I'll keep this for work, maybe try and layer it with something. It might replace my philosophy pure grace as a work perfume.",03/31/15 18:28,Emilee1978

Eternity Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"Forgive my runaway imagination, but this fragrance is a lazy beach vacation in a bottle. It brings to mind that one night when you decide to leave your cottage to go into town for dinner. You throw on your favorite, slightly worn cotton sundress and flip flops and head out with no make up, your cheeks rosy from the sun, hair still damp and curly from the salt water. After eating at the local clam shack you wander into a souvenir shop and buy a fun little necklace made with iridescent purple shells. You put it on as you walk to the ice cream parlor where you get a vanilla cone and sit outside watching the sun set on the most perfect day.

That's what Eternity Summer 2013 smells like to me. The only other thing I can say is that it is one of the softest fragrances I've experienced, both in texture/feel and sillage.",07/07/14 19:16,fleurdefi
Eternity Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"I tell you something the bottle is very very pretty. captures the idea of the sea, the ocean the blue lagoon kinda thing
Well I didn't love it when I bought it in the winter time (at a super low price). This is flower power. A big smack of total floral notes. This reminds me of going to Kew gardens in London, when you step inside the greenhouses and it the air smacks you with a huge floral aroma.
So spring time it is then:) I wore this whilst doing the most enjoyable garden chores today..planting fucshia's, trimming my peonies and bedding petunias.. So yep great fresh floral perfume with Marine, aquatic notes for sure. I liked it today and I think days where it isn't too cold , nice and breezy with dewy air is a perfect time to wear this pretty hippy chic scent.",05/26/14 08:18,ismellsogood

This one was a disappointment for me, just not my thing. The packaging is gorgeous but it smelled like soap to me, powdery bubble bath, Mr. Bubble or grandma's potpourri. I think it's the wisteria, I was never a big fan.

2014 seems to be a better year as this year's version again smells nothing like Eternity but is a light, breezy beach floral scent. I look forward to picking that one up soon before they are gone.",05/17/14 14:52,Silences
Eternity Summer 2013 Calvin Klein,"This is SUCH a lovely fragrance!! I bought it today at a decent discount and am considering going back for the other bottle. Eternity Summer 2013 is a everything I want out of a summer fragrance - it is clean and even just a touch soapy on me, it is light but noticeable meaning it won't become wildly overpowering when the heat hits, and it has really lasted well on my skin. I have been wearing it all day and it is lingering nicely on my wrist. Even though it is aquatic it really isn't watery like some aquatics are. I definitely get a sea air vibe. Maybe some will find this perfume generic and unremarkable, but I adore it. A solid buy!

Update: I don't know if it's my chemistry or what, but this lasted AGES on my skin. I was still able to smell that gorgeous scent on my wrist, very light but still present, and it was still going strong on yesterday's shirt.

Appreciate the folks on this site so much! I should have realized as I own that one, but had put 1/2 the bottle away to use this summer. At any rate I did a blind buy and am very pleased with the result. The wisteria in this reminds me of a water/hyacinth note, a bit reminiscent of Laura Ashley No 1. It is very Spring fresh cut flowers and the bottle suits the scent. It smells like a watercolour and it doesn't fade quickly. I like it better than last year's edition.

CK be Calvin Klein,"In my personal experience, CK be comes across as a lackluster and uninspiring fragrance. I can't even say that I dislike it; it simply falls flat, with minimal development on the skin. The floral notes within it feel artificial and lack vibrancy. Furthermore, the combination of ingredients fails to create a harmonious blend. Considering these aspects, I believe the decision to discontinue its production was more than justified. However, to provide a fair assessment, I must acknowledge that CK be is not an exceptionally terrible composition. I've received even worse fragrances as gifts (incidentally, also from the Calvin Klein brand), but that discussion warrants a separate post.

CK be Calvin Klein,"Scent is not bad. Very unisex, mild, easygoing floral fragrance. But performance is an insult to the industry. This is pretty much scented water. I have MANY aftershaves that last way longer than this. I seriously doubt this is even at EDT concentration. Needless to say, I won't purchase again.",10/02/25 13:25,BigFrench
CK be Calvin Klein,"I'm not familiar with the Calvin Klein line, except for one or two bottles. The notes and accords looked nice, and people said that it was a safe buy, so I wanted to give it a shot.

I'm kinda disapointed. It's difficult to pinpoint or find the notes, honestly, even the basic mains ingredients. For a good hour, until it really dries down, it smells like sunscreen spray, then it smells a little bit more like flowers and lavender, though still with a weird odor over it. Maybe it's an old batch, who knows.

The longevity is, as other people said, atrocious, but this is definitely an amazing fragrance for summer and hot weather. It's also very accessible on discounter websites. 30$ for a 100ml is an amazing deal if you want to expand your collection or simply try it out.

Maybe it's my skin, maybe not my type of fragrance, but CK Be isn't rocking it for me, sadly.",08/16/25 00:25,DoctorLeo

One of the lousiest flankers of anything ever. It smells almost like nothing at all right from first spray. Stays like that for decent amount of time (skin level, i.e. absolutely useless). Really, really, really vague a little sweet green scent...

CK be Calvin Klein,"Rating: 8.0/10

My everyday go-to for years. I've gone through two 6.7 oz bottles of CK Be over the years, which should tell you just how much I’ve worn and enjoyed this fragrance. For a long stretch, this was my daily wear. It was easy to reach for, versatile, and clean.

I still remember the commercials when it first launched as a 6th grader. LOL! The commercials were moody, artistic, and full of that '90s minimalist cool. It really felt like the next big thing after CK One. To me, CK One was king, and it leaned a little sharp and citrusy, where CK Be always felt a bit warmer, and more personal.

It opens with a soft freshness that doesn’t scream for attention, then settles into a cozy, slightly musky skin scent. There’s nothing offensive or polarizing here, just a solid, comforting scent that manages to always feel modern to me.

While it might not be a performance beast, It’s subtle, and it’s perfect for everyday wear. If you’re looking for something low-key, fresh, and warm, CK Be is still a great option 30+ years later.",07/27/25 06:48,Illusent

CK be Calvin Klein,I had this a couple years ago lost the bottle and just bought another one because I’ve been craving it for summer. Found a 3.3fl/100ml bottle at Burlington for around 20 bucks. I love the lavender in here it’s not an essential oil lavender which I like but don’t want to smell like it’s more like a clean laundry airy lavender musky crisp linen to me. I live in east tn and it’s starting to get so humid and hot the only thing I can stand to wear is ck one and this 😭 the silage isn’t the best but I prefer that as I’m a daycare teacher and prefer skin scents or near skin scents when I’m at work. I can wear this and smell it on me throughout the day. I usually reapply every 2/3 hours depending on my breaks and it works great for me.,06/22/25 13:42,kianilla
CK be Calvin Klein,"One of my favorite light and layerable non offensive fragrances. This is not only a good unisex fragrance, but versatile enough for all seasons and for people of different styles or different occasions. Its very fresh, but not super green, more fresh in an airy or ozonic kind of way, safe for mostly any occasion, but might be too light. Not at all sweet, nor does it have any particularly strong notes, if anything I would say the mint, lavender and juniper are the most noticeable.

The only thing that this perfume lacks is in its performance. Its appropriate for most all seasons but it doesn't seem to last long enough in the summer, and its sillage is probably about half a foot lol. Perhaps it also lacks in performance due to its ability to not be an offensive fragrance and a generally acceptable one, its almost too non offensive that its actually kind of unnoticeable at its strength. I feel it would massively benefit if it was stronger.

This is more of a personal take, but for some reason gives me a churchy kind of feel. Imagine an abandoned church in the deep forest, but its at night during a snowy blizzard. The air is fresh, cold and slightly dry, you could smell the trees but its subtle. The smell of the old church's and its incense is weak, but mixes in with this fresh cold air as it flows through its broken windows... maybe its just me but I feel like there is a tiny hint of incense that blends very well with everything, very subtle, unnoticeable. Perhaps this would be a good summer wear for any goths.",06/18/25 22:33,snifferooo
CK be Calvin Klein,"After feeling that CK One Shock had a scent that I liked, I finally decided to buy perfume from Calvin Klein again, yes CK be.

The smell I got when I first sprayed it was mandarin orange, with a touch of lavender and mint. This kind of fragrance is very similar to what I smell at my uncle's house, so when I wear it, some memories take me there.

I didn't expect more from this perfume by CK in terms of SPL, but I found that the longevity is very good, 8+ hours on skin and clothes. For this price, some perfumes like Versace Blue Jeans and some clone perfume brands like Armaf, afnan, rasasi or lattafa are more worth considering.",06/17/25 16:42,seokryu

CK be Calvin Klein,"A fragrance released in 1996 from the good old days that brings back memories of the past with nostalgia, even if you didn't live in that era. Suitable for all times and places, it is classified as unisex but leans more towards men's fragrances.
A harmonious fragrance rich in ingredients, blended with great craftsmanship so that no one aromatic ingredient overpowers the other.
The scent here is rich, creamy, fresh, fruity, herbal, woody, and smoky. A magic you won't find anywhere else. A simple and uncomplicated fragrance with many ingredients, you wish from the first moment that this scent would last with you forever.
Never ask about the performance; the performance is somewhat average, but it is compensated by the magic and depth of the scent.
Pros:
- Subtle and safe fragrance
- Sophisticated drydown
- Pleasant and reliable scent
- Easy to wear and won't offend
Cons:
- Poor longevity
- Short-lasting fragrance
- The bottle design is very primitive
In my personal opinion, if fragrance liquid were put in a niche bottle, it would sell for many times its simple price.
I don't usually buy fragrances twice, but there's an exception to every rule. CK BE is one of the fragrance I've bought several times, and every time I use it, I get compliments as if I'm actually using it for the first time.",05/04/25 16:54,StarA2

CK be Calvin Klein,This fragrance in particular is a fragrance i would personally wear to a pool party on a hot summer's day. The scent is of freshly cut grass it's got a very clean fresh out of the shower type of scent. However there are some performance issues present in this fragrance as a whole. For starters this fragrance is very weak : do not expect any compliments. Others will only be able to smell this if you come up to them personally and ask them to smell you. Secondly the longevity is just incompetent to make this a beast mode fragrance. I would give the scent a decent 6.5/10 but the negatives outweigh the positives in my opinion. Only but this fragrance if your trying to get a blast from the past. Thank you for reading yours sincerely fragheadkp9,03/11/25 17:30,Fragheadkp9

I got this gifted by a cousin and on the first spray I found it nice and safe but shit projection and sillage.

Surely, people around you won't probably notice you are wearing any fragrance, but you will certainly smell clean and fresh and I think that's the purpose of this perfume. If I find it with a good discount, I will probably buy a 200ml bottle for everyday use or the gym. It isn't anything mind-blowing, but it's nice and convenient.",02/09/25 09:50,joaquxxn

In fact I think it’s mandatory to fully appreciate this one. Someone below mentioned that it smells like a Sharpie, which honestly it sorta does at the beginning. This opens a bit harsh. But patience is the key because the dry down is where this stuff shines IMO. Comfy cozy lavender. Musky clean linens. A hint of floral sweetness. All with that melancholic 90s' edge.

Your heart is cold and frozen long ago but also fragile like glass. No one knows of the deep thoughts in your mind, but they can somehow sense it. You are mysterious, but not because you try to be.

Personally, I find that the musky notes, green notes, magnolia and cedar all come off most prominently on my skin. It's not a projection beast by any means, but that's not really what this is meant to be. It's an office scent, a casual scent, a lunch date scent. It's clean, brisk, sophistocated with a TOUCH of sweetness.

Scent/Notes: I call it a fresh, aquatic and neat and clean scent. The notes are quite good like it feels really clean to be honest. (I don’t smell powder in this any how)

Longevity: I believe 2-3 hrs on clothes maximum. (Weak)

Projection: Doesn’t project past 10 mins (Very weak)

Wear: Its a casual wear fragrance/Not suitable for parties or any type of causal gatherings

Season: Performs best in Winters

Overall: I wouldn’t recommend purchasing this perfume at all because the value for money is quite less. You can get other alts for the same amount or even can get an original one for even less.

CK be Calvin Klein,"This scent is an absolute joy. It's complex, green, and inviting. However, its longevity is disappointingly brief—like a fleeting moment. In fact, it has the worst longevity I've ever encountered in any perfume, bordering on absurdity. For me, it doesn't even last an hour. If only it lasted longer, this perfume could easily become a classic.",04/30/24 09:45,asoolsakania

Concentration: Eau de Toilette
Trend: Unisex
Seasons: Spring/Summer
Occasions: Everyday, work, narrow spaces
Average cost

Among the many ""designer"" fragrances it is never easy to find a good quality-price ratio, given that too often marketing deceives the buyer's expectations.
In this case, however, we are faced with an item that has been on the market since the 90s, and has therefore been a must for enthusiasts ever since.
Mostly unisex, floral and fresh perfume, suitable for wearing after a shower or before going to work, perhaps in closed spaces where you don't want to stand out but just have a very pleasant and relaxing smell for those around you.
Its projection is in fact quite weak, as is its duration.
However, excellent for this period, at an extremely accessible cost. Passed overall.

CK be Calvin Klein,"Green, fresh and woody, not dated despite being from the 90s. Nothing special. Ok for a cheapie. Very bad performance, wouldn't buy.",04/13/24 12:05,Perfect Shot
CK be Calvin Klein,"I wanted something unapologetically 90s, and I got it, and yet...didn't quite get it. I actually think these CK fragrances are incapable of ever smelling dated, because this has a timelessly clean quality about it that won't ever fail to inspire an uptick in mood upon spraying. But, it does have almost a soapy feel, and it reminds me of things that I smelled when I was a kid. Or, maybe I did smell this specifically at some point.

-

The opening is grassy, limey, aromatic, fresh and extremely clean. It verges on soapiness. This is a little more masculine than One, Ck All or CK Everyone (but I found Everyone less inspiring personally). There will totally be a large amount of women who probably wouldn't want to smell like this, or at least smell like this often, and that's ok. I'd like to be clear about this because people should know what to expect, the ""lavender"" (it smells like an indistinct herbal note, not necessarily lavender) tips it into traditionally masculine territory (though I always say - 'Who cares? Wear what you like!'). I'm totally OK with it though, and I admit that I have a massive spectrum of perfume types that I enjoy wearing. This doesn't step outside of what I'm comfortable with.

Yes...as others have said, longevity is lacking. But price is a big factor and you can usually find this at outlets for a large bargain, so spraying generously isn't a deal breaker. Also, it's just begging to be worn in summmer...I think it'll be amazingly refreshing, and so the act of spraying in the heat is cooling. I actually welcome reapplication in heat. All this is to say that i wish longevity was better here, but that with cheap summery frags I forgive easily.

People hate sentimentality in reviews. I don't care, you can read someone else's opinion and skip this; but I gotta say, as this dries, I'm hit with a rare, wistful, emotional response that I specifically try and seek out. It reminds me of... something. Boyfriends? Maybe someone earlier? Friends?...maybe not.

It's more like a first crush. And as weird as that is to admit online to internet strangers, I'm gonna say it anyway.

Fragrances are so special because they can unearth echos of memories that you didn't realize you retained...as this does here. Something about the musk and greenness makes me ache with nostalgia, and I love it.",04/08/24 23:33,ShadowsofLight
CK be Calvin Klein,A bit more masculine than CK One but still unisex. It is a 4/10 for me and only because it reminds me of the 90s and early 2000s. I'd give it an 8 if the sillage and longevity were better. It lasts about an hour on my skin and the sillage is abysmal. It's a shame because the scent itself isn't bad.,04/02/24 16:32,BarryUno

CK be Calvin Klein,"There's a reason I wore this perfume for over two decades. While I can't pinpoint any particular note in CK Be, the soup of all the notes together make for such a pleasant, comfortable, wonderful scent. I understand why people find it boring - it's like the oatmeal of perfumes, the boiled potato of colognes, the buttered toast of scents. I can't imagine anyone being offended by it; it's probably the safest of all perfumes out there, ever.

It's not in the same League as CK One

I'm gonna let this crap sit for a few months to see if it macerates . Not worthy of the Calvin Klein name, and I'm a huge fan of most of the Calvin Klein catalog especially Obsession.

Powdery, soapy, clean genuis in an almost one note vibe despite all the many notes/accords used and it doesn't smell like you purposely doused yourself in perfume before work like someone wearing perfume often comes off as having done- more that you just happen to smell clean without being able to pinpoint if it's soap, powder, laundry detergent, a bit of sunscreen, ironing starch, etc. likely won't garner comments as people will assume you're just clean and fresh but I've had one or two in the past who were surprised it was perfume, one wanted to know what sunscreen it was.",01/18/24 16:42,Oberkampf

CK be Calvin Klein,"Ahhhhh , the classic ""Be"" . It's one of those scents where you just can't go wrong. It truly a classic and excellent for those "" I don't know what I want to wear today but still wanna' smell good"" occasions. You can basically wear this scent anytime anywhere. The only negative is that it doesn't last but that might also not be a bad thing. Its very neutral and non offensive, yet you could still pull it of and wear this for a classy occasion in a emergency. It's fresh , it's exciting,it's versatile. It's a must in ones collection.

I used to wear this back in 96' , I liked it then and I like It now. Just as good for a newbie as for a veteran. An excellent cheapie (sometimes) well worth its price. CK is an underrated frag brand in my opinion. They have actually created a few timeless classics if you think about it, long before all these 200$ scents became popular.

CK be Calvin Klein,"CK Be by Calvin Klein:
My first ever fragrance, a masculine-unisex green, floral and citrusy frag suitable for spring/summer with some nice woods at the base. Inexpensive, around £20 for a 100ml so you can afford to overspray and you will need to since despite its very light and doesn't last at all. More suited to younger generations and a good gym/office scent or blind buy. Shame on the performance and longevity though :(

Top Notes: Fresh green grass, crisp citrus from the orange and bergamot, touches of lavender.
Middle Notes: Delicate and floral mainly from the magnolia, orchid and jasmine.
Base Notes: Lighter woody notes of cedar, sandalwood along with some amber and light musk.

CK be Calvin Klein,"I used to like it when I first had it. To be fair, this is a complex perfume that develops as it dries down, I like the smell, too. But as I use it, it fails to create an identity for itself as it changes into different type of scent. That, I could understand. But all of that complexity is short-lived as only you, as the wearer of perfume, is the only who's gonna smell that. The projection is so bad, it dies within an hour, if not a few minutes. This is a skin-scent perfume. Use it on a lazy day, preferably if you're staying at a house and you want to feel cozy. As much as I want to like it, it fails its potential to be a great perfume.

To me it is a sweet toddler toothpaste with added sweeteners scent that I like at first but quickly forgot, I remember not being impressed.

the bottle is some of the worst ever designed, looks like some kind of mini hard liquor bottles, why is it solid black? you can't even see the fluids let alone the colour. This doesn't look appealing at all on your vanity. It is the lowest of low, even the Harley Davidson and Axe grocery store editions look better than this. A fragrance buff like me didn't even want to collect the flask, into the bin it went. The name is pretty bland either, just 'be'? Might as well call it '@' or 'me'. Doesn't capture at all the pure magic of Eternity and it is as if they made it all dull on purpose so that Eternity stands out.

CK be Calvin Klein,"I just love love, CK be. It must be my all-time favorite unisex fragrance.
It sways between a masculine, herbal green opening to a more feminine, delicate floral heart, but then settles as an exactly unisex fragrance in the base.
It is mostly a lavender musk scent with some vanilla and woods in the base. The top notes had me thinking it would be very green and sharp, but on the contrary, they are just emphasizing the herbal aspect of lavender with a tad of citrus. The florals wipe out any sharpness, and it is mostly smooth and velvety. The musk is a clean, powdery, soft one reminiscent of the musk in Johnson’s baby products very soothing and calming.
The good sillage in the opening reduces very quickly to a very close scent-bubble, but I disagree that the overall longevity is bad. I have a relatively new bottle purchased three years ago. The longevity ranges from 3 to 4 hours which is expected for an EDT. However, it needs some movement, breeze or air draft to be sensed. But I am an over sprayer and I usually spray my hair and clothes as well, so take that into consideration.
You can improve longevity by using a matching lotion. I think that the aromatherapy line from Bath and Body Works (like Lavender Vanilla or Vanilla Eucalyptus) would be a good match. You can also use lavender scented Johnson baby oil as they have similar lavender musk theme.
Overall I find CK Be a perfect fume for the friendly introvert. It is relaxed but charming, subdued but also elegant and classy. It is mellow yet still spicy and sensual. It is the unisex fragrance for me.",06/21/23 01:59,Tinabill

CK be Calvin Klein,alright smell with negative longevity,06/04/23 11:20,XtraLaw
CK be Calvin Klein,"Let me preface this by saying if you spritz a bit of this on a tester strip or anything besides your skin, you're going to get that sharp, bright, soapy impression of a lot of these 90s musks or aromatics. On the skin, it introduces itself sharply but mellows quickly, too quickly. It isn't long before there's hardly any impression at all. I consider myself someone with a sensitive nose and I don't pick up hardly anything after two hours. In those two hours though, it lingers with a light impression of bright wood, musk, and green notes, the confluence of which strikes me as a kind of green tea accord. It's very elegant and beautiful, bright, clean, and very unisex. Unlike One, Be seems to really meld with your body's natural scent and accompany the skin, opposed to generating this perpetual forcefield of scent fluctuating over it. Those fleeting impressions bear the aesthetic hallmarks of sleek, modern, refined minimalism of CK at the time.

I'm inclined to believe the formulation was stronger at its inception, for CK to continue something that has historically been so weak is unlikely. I hear some people say similar things about CK One, but the longevity on that one is like a radioactive isotope decaying, it'll be noticeable on clothes for days without a wash, and sometimes that's not even enough. My expectations were neutral for this one after reading other reviews mention how light and weak it is, something I cynically chalked up to incessantly impossible-to-please crowds of perfume enthusiasts who are either offended how projecting something is or are lamenting it's barely there. But here, the crowd was correct. It's barely there.

I'm saddened it doesn't have a little more longevity. The lack of projection doesn't even bother me that much, I'd be delighted to even be the only one smelling this as I catch wafts from my wrist as I rest my cheek on my palm. But it seems eager to sublimate from your skin as quickly as possible. From a house that produced iconic 90s powerhouses like Escape and One, I expected a lot more from Be. On the topic of One, I note that it and Be flirt with similar themes in perfumery and the general aesthetic impression they're aiming for. They both are aiming at that bright yet mellow, clean, unisex vibe of the later 90s. Be is more calm, One is more intense. Be has escaped the fate One would meet in becoming so popular that its scent was mimicked ad nauseam in dupes and other house's formulations. Be, on the other hand, smells familiar, as it participates in popular fragrance themes of the time, but sits in its own niche, a little more refined and subdued than One. If only it would stick around as long as it's older brother.

If you see a honkin 200ml of this laying around at a discount store or perfume site for CHEAP (extremely common) go ahead and pick it up. Spritz yourself when you want to wear something tragically fleeting yet calm and refined, or when you might wear something later you don't want to put on now, Be will definitely be out the door by then. Be is a conflicting fragrance to me, but I can't help but coming back to enjoying it for what it is, in all its deficiencies.",05/29/23 19:44,seito

The scent profile is quite simple, yet quite unique; this is one of the most inoffensive fragrances that I've ever smelled & I can't imagine anyone would dislike it. It is also quite unisex & literally anyone can pull it off.

The performance on this is quite weird. In my opinion, this doesn't last over 4 hours max. However; the last time I used this was in 2017, when I was in college, and did about 5 sprays with this, as it is very light. About half the day in when I assumed it was completely gone, a chick in my class told me I smelt amazing; so perhaps others around you can smell it on you.

CK be Calvin Klein,"The smell is violet colored, dark as a evening in a garden ,soapy floral, fresh and mysterious.

Its one of those perfumes which you hate for its longevity and will always keep a bottle to sniff often just to please yourself.

CK be Calvin Klein,"Over 20 years ago, I used to layer this with Classic from Banana Republic. The resulting mixture was a beautiful scent that could be worn by any gender and lasted longer than either of the two components worn alone.",03/26/23 21:40,JSRbeatles
CK be Calvin Klein,"Very clean fresh mysterious metallic lavender thing going on. It's a good scent, but it just does not perform. You could go crazy on the sprays, and it still will only last about 2 hours tops. Good for the gym I guess.",03/16/23 10:33,Raymundo

CK be Calvin Klein,"If this perfume only last longer, it would've been one of the best fresh fragrances. I love the smell so much because it's very clean, soft, and very inoffensive. But it's inoffensive to the point that it's gone after 2-3 hours.",03/13/23 19:19,Al Prince
CK be Calvin Klein,"This has to be one of the most beautiful scents I have ever worn. Calvin Klein put so many notes into their fragrances and everything blends together so well. It's one of those scents were you'll continually smell your wrist just to enjoy the heart warming smell.

Absolutely anyone could wear this. The best way to describe the smell is green; fresh and uplifting.

Sadly this is were the positives end. It has virtually no longevity and cannot be enjoyed by anyone around you because there's next to no scent trail.

This is why you can pick it up for so cheap; there's always a reason.

If only Calvin Klein increased the strength I would have this a signature scent. But that's just wishful thinking.

CK be Calvin Klein,"CK be is all time fav. I started on my first bottle like 8 years ago. Through all these years never once have I stopped liking this fragrance. while for other perfumes my taste fluctuates a lot. Sometimes when I pick up a jacket and smell something really pleasing, I would try to figure out what it is then I realize it was the trace of CK be remaining on it. This frag is the only one that really relaxes me. When i wear it I feel Im not trying to please anybody. Just immersing myself in this soft green aroma. I bought a 200ml bottle today while I still have over half of a 100 bottle. Just in case it discontinues sometime in the future.",02/14/23 11:14,RealWen

CK be Calvin Klein,"I recently bought a deadstock bottle of the original formulation from 1996. I was instantly transported back to the feelings that this wonderful fragrance brought me all those years ago, when it was my signature scent:

Young adulthood. Independence. Living on your own. Establishing your own identity. Making friends. Discovering your sexuality. Living in Boston, New York, DC, or Chicago. Being effortlessly, gloriously thin. We were broke but carefree and sexy. You only owned one perfume.

Am I making sense? Well, in any case, the fragrance itself is a journey back in time. You know you've picked up a 90's fragrance when you see FREESIA listed in the notes. Did they make anything without freesia in the 1990's? CK Be's most notable accords to me are: minty-lavender; dewy green freesia-magnolia; a sexy peach skin; and lashings of clean laundry musk.

Vastly superior to CK One - though both were hugely consequential for bringing the concept of ""UNISEX"" fragrances into public awareness.

Recently picked up a bottle for the nostalgia, sprayed it and was immediately met with a flourishing rush of clean, fresh, lavender citrus. Then, just as fast as the fragrance came on, it disappeared completely. I tried several more sprays on paper and skin and couldn’t get the smell back.

Just soap, and that’s with my face all the way shoved into my arm. Anosmia, I suppose. Kinda sad, really.",01/13/23 10:27,jesseshinn
CK be Calvin Klein,"Picked this up today for 19 CAD. It definitely is a “white soap” fragrance. Almost reminds me of sun tan lotion on a beach. Very delicate with low silage. I def can see this being worn after a shower or for bed to freshen up. It’s ok in that regard but I would have been unhappy paying more than 19 bucks. Still I add a soap fragrance to my collection.


Addition : I wore this to bed last night. Still a lingering skin scent as I lay here 10 hours later.",01/07/23 22:39,dsixdsix
CK be Calvin Klein,"CK fragrances are a hit - or miss with my chemistry, really. Eternity makes me weep, Euphoria is screechy, Obsessed smells like someone is obsessed with hygiene products (not in a good way)... This one smells like a male version of Women, which I love.

CK be Calvin Klein,"Such a 'no brainer' on every level for anyone who enjoys feeling clean & fresh, I personally love the neroli-like scent on my skin & scent bubble. Most all cheapies come with the obligatory alcohol blast opening to some measure - not this. While it does not smell expensive, it certainly does not smell cheap, which is unbelievable mindful you can get the big bottle 6.7oz / 200ml for just over $20. It's my 'around-the-house-daily-driver'.",12/27/22 06:08,Chaselark

I have a 200ml bottle of this that I blind bought and I wear it every night to bed and it is absolutely PERFECT for that purpose. It’s on my favourites list for that reason, because it is the most perfect cosy “can’t wear anything else, nothing too heavy” scent. Beautiful lavender (one of my favourite notes), green florals and clean musk. A big love from me, even if it’s nothing particularly daring.",12/25/22 07:49,chlorodream

Only downside is the longevity isn't great, But I don't mind spraying more when I have a big 6.7oz bottle. As long as you enjoy lavender, This is a safe bet! Definitely gives androgynous, Mysterious vibes, I like it.",10/11/22 17:06,vixen1995

CK be Calvin Klein,"Another amazing truly unisex fragrance from CK. I love this but I definitely don't think ""green"" as the top. I get powdery, fresh, and lavender without being soapy. It feels so cozy and soft. I love this for bed and cant wait to wear it in the fall.",09/05/22 22:54,AllyMage
CK be Calvin Klein,"Very ""serious"" fragrance, really good, great performance.",08/31/22 19:39,leoj.a
CK be Calvin Klein,"So my favourite part of this scent is all in the top notes. It starts off aromatic, almost fougere like. Like a fresh out of the shower smell. Then it starts to develop into a clean smelling fragrance. But more of a detergent scent. Reminds me of the smell of clean laundry or clean linens.

If you’re a fan of soapy or fresh laundry type of scents, then you will enjoy CK Be. It’s very simple. It also does not last very long, or project, so don’t expect an amazing performing fragrance. But it is a fun fragrance for a quick dumb reach, or even just to spray on your wrist and smell for an hour or two.",08/31/22 07:50,EddieGravity
CK be Calvin Klein,"A sleeper in my collection and one of my personal faves as well as one of my fave dumb reaches !!

In terms of scent, despite the many notes it’s actually quite simple. To my nose it just smells like a nice shampoo or tanning lotion. Idk why but that’s what it smells like ! (In a good way)

It’s extremely comforting,easy to wear and surprisingly has gotten a few compliments when others have gotten close ! You will definitely get nice wafts of this throughout the day without it being overwhelming. (Even with 1-3 sprays)

To my nose it smells very green,airy and has a fresh linen by the ocean feel !

Some complain about performance but I get 6-10 hours with average projection but very good silage

Overall rating -8 out of 10 ! Very solid fragrance for a very good price but nothing exceptional!! Ideal for casual use and I’d say this is unisex but leans masculine",08/17/22 08:51,Ryanmmas26
CK be Calvin Klein,"A beautiful yet affordable unisex scent. I first got this in Jr High when it first came out and only recently repurchased it as an almost 40 yr old, but still love it. It's nonoffensive and I really enjoy the juniper note. Refreshing, gentle, but fun.",08/13/22 13:08,pescadofish
CK be Calvin Klein,"Maybe the best comfort scent ever created for men. There's no need to talk about projection, because it doesn't project at all, but longevity isn't bad. They reformulated it for shure, which is detectable on the opening but 20 minutes or so and it is the same thing. It's a stable good to go perfume, not more. It worth a try.",08/12/22 14:36,patman21

CK be Calvin Klein,"90s fragrance, suitable for teenagers and twenties with quicksilver on. Dynamic, fresh fragrance, it smells of cleanliness and light-heartedness.

CK be Calvin Klein,"Do not listen to those who say that it is a faint scent and that it disappears after 15 minutes ... Surely here on Fragrantica there are many people used to heavy and very sweet perfumes, obviously in comparison this is lighter and softer, but not so much! If it has been on the market for 26 years (1996) and is still among the best sellers in the world, there must be a reason ... don't you think? ... As the description of the fragrance says, it is a ""transparent, silky and very sexy"" perfume ... I assure you that it is really true! I only use 2 sprays because over 2 it bothers me, it gets a bit heavy, and I assure you that everyone around me feels it well! A friend of mine this winter, a few meters away and in the open air, told me ""what a good smell you have"", and I had only put 2 sprays under my heavy jacket! Even my brother, just yesterday, a few meters away heard it and told me ""how good your perfume is!"". In conclusion, the fragrance can be felt, and how, already with only 2 sprays, and it is wonderfully good, relaxing and makes you feel good! Far better and more sensual than its predecessor One, which despite many attempts I cannot tolerate!",07/17/22 09:25,FreshSummer
CK be Calvin Klein,"CK Be is a shy, pretty boy who plays sports. He's cool but also has a sensitive side. Someone who makes you feel warm because he thinks you're the cutest girl in the world and is a good listener. The type who walks you home from school and saves his allowance to take you out to dinner. I tested this not too long ago, and it's all nostalgia that wouldn't linger long enough because of its cologne nature.

CK Be will forever be the 90s for many of us.",07/11/22 04:49,staceydtb
CK be Calvin Klein,"I think I percieve this fragrance very differently than most people. I'm not getting *any* green notes at all, not in a million years. Not really getting any ""fresh laundry"" either.

To me this fragarnce is a little bit subtle, a little bit mysterious, a little bit nocturnal. It's quite sexy but not vulgar. There's a little bit of sweetness but not too much. I know the marketing is prominently unisex but I think it skews masculine. I like to wear this on dates.

CK Be is also very much a 90es icon and I associate it with a certain kind of edgy 90es cool. I imagine Shirley Manson, Chloë Sevigny, or Lori Petty might have worn this.",07/09/22 17:57,kingderella
CK be Calvin Klein,"For me, this smells like a softer, more powdery version of Davidoff Cool Water. For anyone who feels the opening of Cool Water is too concentrated or...sharp, CK Be sort of takes the essence of that and cuts it down to be more accommodating to your nose. The dry down smells like spicy baby powder on my skin. Of course, this means that longevity suffers. It immediately becomes a skin scent and I get about 1-2 hours before I can't smell it anymore. However, with 6.7oz bottles being found under $30, you can spray away and not worry about running out too fast. The atomizer is halfway decent too, it sprays wide rather than far, so full coverage doesn't take too long.

CK be Calvin Klein,"the smell is very generic, it reminds me of any other men's body wash or shampoo—even Irish spring soap. It's pretty artificial and not very smooth, decently harsh in the opening and the dry down is better. This has little to no projection and sits very close to the skin. Better to save your money and purchase something else in all honesty.",05/25/22 10:33,juhuang2001

CK be Calvin Klein,"Not a review, an observation. I wore this back when it originally came out. I remember it being a wonderful kinda powdery fresh scent without being too citrusy. I ordered a new bottle to add back to my collection. When it comes I want to challenge all of these ""weak and doesn't last"" reviews: more often than not when I buy back my old classics this almost never the case. I almost never have longevity/performance issues with my old favorites when I buy current batches. I will update when I get my new bottle.",03/10/22 20:21,mikestro
CK be Calvin Klein,"I love this, it's simply aromatherapy for me, the lavender is the most notable element here, then the musk & while I'm not usually a fan of musky scents but it's so clean here that it doesn't bother me. A comforting and unpretentious fragrance, so easy to wear and at any time by anyone, as long as they like lavender!

A timeless scent, I just wish it projected more, longevity is just OK particularly on clothing. They should make an intense version or shock horror bring out a reformulation that actually improves performance (without altering the scent)!",02/28/22 04:03,Dark Owl

It’s interesting to me that it has notes like rose and oakmoss that are not usually my favorites, but all together in this perfume, they’re great! This one is the only Calvin Klein fragrance I’ve ever liked, none of his others ever interested me. Unfortunately, he never was able to produce anything better than this, his very first fragrance.",05/20/23 09:26,LuckyDay27
Calvin Klein Calvin Klein,"Perhaps the most sophisticated and nuanced of all the fragrances from Calvin Klein also happens to be its first, released in 1978, and it's the most beautiful woody rose with fruity, peachy top notes and a green floral heart. The green notes here, however, aren't necessarily sharp or cold, there is just as much velvety as its verdant: the feel of petals and closely packed moss. As it further develops, a carnation merges with the heart, lending an ever so subtle granularity to the velvet, like occasional beads embroidered in, teasing the skin.

The full-figured rose lasts into the dry down, extended by an oakmoss that rivals that of the most hallowed chypres, shades of cedar, lingering whiffs of stone fruit, and a musky resonance. That this has been overlooked seems criminal; perhaps this is due to Calvin Klein's inconsistent reputation in the perfume realm. If their Obsession gets all the attention when it was really their competently done ""also ran"" of Must de Cartier, surely we should show some reverence for this truly original and magnificent creation.",04/10/23 07:41,alphairone

Not long ago, I was reading a biography of Calvin Klein that talked about the launch of this, his first fragrance.

Liquid Gold Euphoria Men Calvin Klein,"This is a lovely perfume. Warm, spicy, woody and a bit sweet. I think there is much more than pepper, saffron and sandalwood. If anything pepper is not very distinctive, saffron is. There is a likeable sweetness and amber-like feel that is just phenomenal. The woody dry down is also awesome.

On my skin it lasts at least 8 hours and has a decent sillage.

The overall vibe is for sure oriental and masculine. The perfume is diverse though and can be - in my opinion - worn at almost any occasion and any season.

Great value for money.",07/01/22 00:08,shammamm
Liquid Gold Euphoria Men Calvin Klein,"This is a really great fragrance. It smells really good. It's warm spicy woody safranny/leathery. I do get some powderiness and fresh spicy on top of it and the opening is a bit balsamic to my nose but that settles down very fast. Overall, after amber gold I am truly surprised by this coming from CK. I did manage to get one of the 2015 bottles so not sure about reformulations later. If Chopard Oud Malaki and Euphoria amber gold had a baby that would be this. It's different from both but also share some DNA. If you have oud Malaki or Amber Gold and you like it, and you can find one of these at a reasonable price then I would highly recommend to give it a try.
IMO, another fragrance from CK that was probably ahead of its time and if resurrected it would probably see a lot more success.

It lasts all day now and performs really very well. Before, the saffron was so sharp and dominating that it smelt like a box of bandaids..not anymore! Once this matures its really exquisite. I get more of the pepper and sandlewood and the saffron is laid back and gives it a soft and creamy feel. Man, this lasted me the full day. Had a kind of clean laundry smell and it somehow smells warm. Very nice office scent.",01/15/22 19:04,Jerre
Liquid Gold Euphoria Men Calvin Klein,"It has taken a LONG time for this frag to grow on me. I think the bottle is just slow to macerate. It used to be a full on bandaid container smell and now it has smoothed down some. The saffron in this is vicious and quite overbearing on a fresh bottle. It isn't woody and it isn't fresh as the write up says. It is powdery spice is what it is. I find it a bit linear and smells pretty much the same from start to finish. Still is a bit medicine smelling, mercurial even. There seems to be a little bit of flower in it and old dusty leather. I think this is how a church would have smelt in the 17-1800's. Its not bad really, just different and dusty. This is a hard one to really nail down. I don't think anyone smelling it on you will be repelled, but you won't get compliments on it either.

Liquid Gold Euphoria Men Calvin Klein,"A lovely soft & spicy wood scent.

Euphoria Liquid Gold, like Euphoria Pure Gold, has no relation smell-wise to the originals Euphoria and Euphoria Intense.

The smell is a soft woody scent (sandal) with a sharp, peppery spiciness (black pepper). I am not picking enough saffron to rate it second on the notes pyramid.

An oriental/Arabic smell for cold weather.

Both Euphoria Gold are a really good & interesting step from CK. They are trying, and delivering some good, somewhat exotic smells here, especially for the non-Arabic crowd.

Liquid Gold Euphoria Men Calvin Klein,"I'm quite fond of the Euphoria Men line. Every release that came before this one has ranged from decent to delicious. When I heard that this fragrance had only three notes (black pepper, saffron and sandalwood) I was skeptical yet intrigued. After I sprayed this on though, I was mortified.

This smells like vomit; I'm not exaggerating. The mix of saffron and sandalwood is potent and harsh, and reminds me of vomit. My nose became accustomed to the scent after a while, but I never got to the point where I found this to be pleasing.

It goes without saying, but this is definitely not a blind buy. Even if you're someone that likes Liquid Gold, the truth is that it's unbelievably divisive, and I can't imagine a scenario where you could wear this in public and not turn off half the room.

I appreciate the simplicity of Liquid Gold, and give Calvin Klein credit for taking a risk and releasing something this bold and different, but at the end of the day I just find this fragrance nauseating and can't recommend it in the slightest.",06/09/20 15:22,LukeS
Liquid Gold Euphoria Men Calvin Klein,"Very similar to Bvlgari Man in Black Essence. VERY saffron heavy. Dries down to a spicy, sweet, saffron scent. Not picking up much to any sandalwood at all.

Liquid Gold Euphoria Men Calvin Klein,"Two sprays to the chest, hardly any scent. It takes a while to get going but it does get a lot stronger. I agree with the minty quality, sort of attached to an obvious saffron. The mintiness eventually dissipates considerably but the saffron lasts a very long time. I don't get a ""real"" sandalwood here, but more of a smoky, aroma chemical woodiness, possibly a combination of several chemicals, though it doesn't seem to be overloaded with iso e super, thankfully. For me the major problems are: 1. I'm not a huge saffron fan, 2. I think at times it would nauseate me due to the ""chemical"" nature, and 3. it's not complex, so nuances are not likely to reveal themselves with subsequent wearings (or perhaps I'm especially sensitive to at least some of the aroma chemicals used, and so they really dominant the experience). I'll also mention that the first Cadillac fragrance marketed to men was not all that different, so if you can find that one inexpensively it might be good enough for you. There is no real connection between this scent and the first Gold Euphoria for Men, and I prefer that one due to the clear honey note, the complexity, and the lack of obvious aroma chemicals, but Liquid Gold is certainly an interesting fragrance that is not some sort of generic/mass market cash grab, IMO.",01/28/19 11:28,Bigsly
Liquid Gold Euphoria Men Calvin Klein,"This is outstanding! Fans of a few classic Gucci offerings (Gucci PH, Rush, and Envy) will really appreciate this one. Noticed someone below mention that they dont get the sandalwood, but to my nose, that's the lead player here. Full-on sandalwood. Woody, smoky, with a few dry spices. Pops off my skin in the winter months. It's not listed, but I wouldnt be surprised at all if the note breakdown mentioned incense. How CK ever got from the original Euphoria, to this, is beyond my comprehension.",11/07/18 22:00,Inenell

Liquid Gold Euphoria Men Calvin Klein,"Smoky, woody, manly magnificence in a classy black and gold bottle.

This beauty is first and foremost a very saffron-forward sandalwood fragrance. As such, it strikes me a bit on the ""mature"" side, and as such it's not going to be for everyone.

Top notes include a very camphoric side of saffron, which could be both unexpected and off-putting, but give it time. It levels off soon enough.

Once the saffron volatiles blow off, a warm and smoky side of saffron comes out, and puts it all into perspective. Without this, the sandalwood note (heavy on the javanol) would carry Liquid Gold into a dryness that would be both overly synthetic and too incomplete to fully enjoy. With it, LG morphs into something rounder and warmer, all without introducing more than just a little bit of sweetness. Pepper isn't prominent in any way, but it also compliments the effects of saffron in offsetting the powerful sandalwood base.

Warning: This is not a crowd pleaser. It's something you wear for your own enjoyment, and for those who can appreciate a challengingly dry and dark saffron/woody combination. Personally, I dig it! Try layering this with the likes of Molinard Cher Wood or MBZ Club Black for ""next level"" depth...",06/30/18 12:55,OntheMark

Liquid Gold Euphoria Men Calvin Klein,"Horrible sillage. When I first put it on I was left wondering if I had a cold or something inhibiting my sense of smell. I bought mine ""shipped and sold by Amazon"" on cyber Monday for $40. As a blind buy, it's probably one of the most disappointing I've ever made. The scent is pleasant, but it's just impossible to smell it without putting my nose directly on my skin. If this had some projection, really anything more than the NOTHING it currently has, then this would be a great edp. But this continues the trend for me. I've never had good luck with CK branded scents.",11/30/17 23:50,kmita
Liquid Gold Euphoria Men Calvin Klein,"I never thought I would own another CK fragrance again and here I am writing a review.

CK was popular among my peers and I growing up and after running threw all the originals and owning a few, I moved on.

That was until I stumbled across liquid gold and blind bought it based on reviews here that it was niche. @FreshTones said it: woody, spicy, and sweet which I find blissful! To top it off, it's a powerhouse for longevity. Indoors, this will last easily 12 hours! I simply couldn't ask for more.

Although I havent tried Euphoria Gold, this blows away the original and intense versions imo.

Perfect for winter and fall. Warm climate buyers should be careful since it may be over powering in hot climates.",10/26/17 21:09,Epk
Liquid Gold Euphoria Men Calvin Klein,"Outlet stores have become a regular outing for me lately as I've been finding super buys. This is one of them and what a pleasant surprise. I've had a modicum of success with CK overall, so I can't be too dramatic about it. Euphoria Gold, Reveal, Shock, Escape... Even Dark Obsession is pleasant enough. All pale in comparison to this baby right here.

The opening is a jolt to the senses. Woody, spicy, sweet. STRONG. Nothing smells synthetic at all, superb quality. Being a fairly simple scent, Liquid Gold delivers on it's promises of a natural smelling mixture of it's parts. It stays a strong woody and spicy for quite awhile into the dry down. There is where it hits it's mark. A dry, almost powdery version of the beginning is left projecting for what seems like forever. Warm, sweet, so creamy.

This bad boy is date signature ten fold but beware... If you spray this too many times (like I did) expecting a little more from your CK, your date may not be able to breathe. Longevity and sillage are beastly. I would say this is in my top five most intense fragrances. I would suspect it for an older crowd, probably above 30. Cold weather is probably going to be your best bet as well. For the price I see it going for online, I'd say well worth it. May not be for some so blind buying may not be appropriate but I'm sure glad I did.",10/16/17 22:33,FreshTones

The crackling of the fire ripples through the room and some of the smoke escapes. U get a deep awareness of the still and quiet place you're in. As u take it all in u notice the warm inviting smell. It is calming and soothing. U go back to your routine in the city and long to be taken back to the mountains. U take out your ck liquid gold and spray it on, that's it, all of a sudden you're there again, u feel the fire and experience the smell of you're beautiful mountain moment.

Update

This is a longevity and projection beast. First smell was strong but nice then I kept smelling my wrist and it was strong but I stopped this and appreciated as it lingers around me.

If u love sandalwood then this is for u. This is the most beautiful sandalwood, nothing artificial smelling, this is an amazing fragrance if u can warm up to it. I'm not sure how it always comes across because it's so strong and unique, but I love it.

Am enjoying it in the comfort of my home in Sydney Australia, we're at the end of winter. According to some people this scent fades quickly in warm climates which I will soon see as spring and summer roll in. Jettison could pick up coconut and cinnamon & I get that too. A real surprise from CK and my new signature scent :))

Update

Ive had more time to reflect on this scent and im still very much in love with it, however this is a when your home scent. Perfect for cooler times. Keeps me warm. It's the deep, woody, smoky experience I love. Very comforting scent. home beacause i imagine smelling this on someone else and I really don't think I would like it.

Liquid Gold Euphoria Men Calvin Klein,"I work at Macy's as a vendor for Coty Prestige and we just got this fragrance in and I absolutely love it. It's such a quality sandalwood combined with that dry saffron. The opening is a bit weird because the saffron and sandalwood come off as smokey in tandem. I think it's the most unique and ""niche"" out of the Calvin Klein range. I was told by other vendors and associates that not many people are liking it due to the strong woody opening. It is a bit above the mainstream to really appreciate, not to sound like a snob. The drydown is more dusty sandalwood and saffron and it's definitely more approachable and I hate this word but ""cozy"". I really hope that we keep this one in our lineup because I think other fragheads/people in the fragrance community will really enjoy it. The projection is strong at first but I think it becomes a skinscent after about 2 to 3 hours; longevity is pretty good too. I got at least 6 hours on my skin and that was on dry skin.

The price is steep for this Eau De Parfum. It's in the high $90's to $100 range in one size with no gift sets as of right now. Some may say this fragrance is too simplistic and I can see that, but compared to other fragrances on the market today with every note but the kitchen sick, Demeter you should be making that one ;), it's nice to have a fragrance stripped back. This is probably the most niche quality fragrance Calvin Klein has produced. Perfect for all and winter.

For the aroma, i totally love it. I got compliment for this because of the sweet taste.

I wonder if it went thru a re-formulation for the introduction to the USA....???.... Still, I really like the scent alot!
The note you see listed above, to my nose, is exactly what you get. I am still upset about the discontinuation of the first Euphoria Gold....one of my Top 5's. I guess that happened to make ""room"" for this version on the shelves. As usual, the longevity is lacking...damn !!
But I honestly will have to do a ""full"" wearing to investigate that part.",10/23/16 15:28,mapache
Liquid Gold Euphoria Men Calvin Klein,"This is a ""dark"" fragrance in the sense that its smell can be related to other fragrances that incorporate the words, ""Black"" ""Noire"" and ""Night"" in their titles. In other words, it has that particular sweetness that is related to men's fragrances often intended for date nights and night clubs. Liquid Gold is a sweet woody-spicy fragrance, a touch powdery--a combination of a robust, bold sandalwood accord paired with saffron. The black pepper in this doesn't smell like pepper but rather it gives the fragrance a fresh-spicy edge. And that's something that I think is important to clarify with Liquid Gold if you're to understand anything about it by reading a review; although this is a very powerful fragrance with intense projection and a far-reaching sillage, it doesn't feel particularly thick or heavy. It maintains a sort of powdery freshness that makes it comfortable to wear. So it's indeed strong, but it's not the kind of scent that will weigh you down and make you feel like you're dragging around a heavy cloud of scent as long as you keep the sprays to a reasonable amount. This is a quality scent; the sandalwood is solid--it actually smells like sandalwood, as opposed to many fragrances which claim to use it-- and its sweet saffron is aromatic and pleasant, with a smooth, polished feel. I could imagine if this were sold in Sephora possibly under a different brand and name it would do very well. Call it ""Tom Ford Midnight Noir"" and people would love it. Unfortunately, Calvin Klein has developed something of a bad reputation among fragrance enthusiasts, so I think a lot of people have overlooked this one. But I think CK's been on the rise. Many of their recent releases--Reveal Men, Euphoria Gold, CK2, and CK Shock--are actually pretty good, and show signs of improvement in their department. You can add Liquid Gold Euphoria to this list as well. Considering it's now available in the US for under $60 it's definitely worth sampling and I'd even recommend it as a blind buy with some words of caution: Liquid Gold is INTENSE, and it has a sweetness that some find a bit feminine. Personally, I don't think it smells too feminine--at least not in the sense of florals and white musk--which are usually the notes that do it for me. Liquid Gold doesn't have those. Also, you probably won't be using this as a daily-wear style of fragrance. Due to its projection and sweet, woody-spicy character it feels best suited for nights out and colder ones at that. Overall, Liquid Gold Euphoria has excellent performance--big projection and 12+ hours of longevity--and avoids any harsh, synthetically chemical accords or the flat and sort of feeble structure some CK compositions of the past have exhibited. It will project an alluring sillage that seems designed to appeal to a mainstream audience as it's pleasant and devoid of any ""weird"" or awkward notes. Thumbs up.

To help figure out if you'd like it, think Dior Homme Parfum, Tom Ford Noir Extreme, La Nuit De L'Homme, Bulgari Man Black, Valentino Uomo and CH Men. While Liquid Gold smells different than these, it fits within this genre of dark, woody-sweet men's date fragrances.",10/16/16 13:38,Buysblind

I was dreaming of the sandalwood note of Trend or Rush, what I get is a saffron bomb that mellows to a creamy spiced sandalwood that was unfamiliar to me. That is not a bad thing. It smells unlike any typical western scent from Sephora in my opinion, it's what I imagine the youth of the UAE smelling like. I find it young, it's a masculine scent. I get a heady floral spicey sandalwood that projects and gets noticed with positive results. Definitely will be much better in the fall and winter, in the heat of Texas summer is deteriorates a bit to the sweet side but not syrupy. I'm glad I got this because it seems like it will disappear into obscurity...",07/19/16 18:11,psychocandy
Liquid Gold Euphoria Men Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein Liquid Gold Euphoria was allegedly released only outside the US in 2014 when it came out but luckily it has become available on BeautySpin recently ($72 for 100ml) so I was fortunate enough to grab a bottle. Its mainstay notes are vanilla, pepper, and balsam fir, but I get an element of sandalwood as well. The result is a very nice cold-weather-friendly composition that stands out from the rest of the Euphoria line.

To that point, Liquid Gold is the best expression of Euphoria I've tried--the sweetness of the line, with the spiciness of Gold, peppiness of Intense, yielding a truly interesting gourmand creation. Warm, spicy, sweet, smooth--this could be a cold weather mainstay for many.

Liquid Gold Euphoria also has the distinction (for me) of being the only EDP concentration Calvin Klein's men fragrance on the market that I'm aware of, though I could be neglectful here.

Accordingly, performance is very strong in terms of both projection and especially longevity. And although I'm testing it in the day, this is definitely preferable for nighttime usage, and can dress up well for formal occasions. I almost find this worthy of being kept in the cooler, though it's not terribly expensive.

Certainly a compelling blind buy and something you ought to check out if you like the sound of it---the consensus seems to be strongly in its favor.

Liquid Gold Euphoria Men Calvin Klein,"Liquid Gold is not for the fainthearted. Neither it is for people who likes run of the mill types. Probably, it is not so good for dusty humid climate. It is for the winter, for people who can come close together, bodies hugging each other. Your girlfriend had to come close enough to feeeeeeeeeeeeeel the scent! The first note it comes to mind is metal and then the next thing it hits you is sour, not the sourness of citrus or lemony or orange. Just sour. in two words, my review is ""Sour Metal"". Probably it mimics armpit sweat minus the cumin. I don't know why people mentions armpits as cumin flavour!! Eludes me, most armpit sweat small differently. It may go well on a rockstar, sweaty and energetic while the stage is fire lit! It's good for people riding on a Harley, chains dragging on from the black jeans, tattoos over arms, Gothic! That's it! This is a Gothic scent! The koel lined mascaric girlfriend with all leather black trousers and a sleeveless top to go with it. Smudged so to say. The smudginess is in the perfume, nothing straight. It's made to feel careless. And yes, it reminds of sex, sweaty sex on a empty highway, the sun soaking your naked torsos. But the longevity is not hat great, unless you spray it on your armpits.

Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"This is an interesting one. I don't personally don't pick up any orange note off the top. There is some black pepper for sure. The one fruit I pick up on is coconut. I wasn't expecting it but I'm okay with it. Its like a creamy, mildly sweet type of coconut that blends well with the dominant leather note that's in here. Suede and Vetiver really helps to put those two together. Its a really pleasant scent profile and is rather masculine. Its even sexy and sophisticated. I'm sure you probably don't believe me but it just simply works. You can wear this year round because its very versatile. This is a good office friendly scent and can even be worn on a causal date especially if you got some leather or faux leather on of some kind lol. I really like it and I have been drawn to wearing this one more than expected. Its an addicting scent.",10/27/25 12:59,BigDukes4Ya
Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Having first tried Clavin Klein's original Defy as Eau de Toilette (a nice and clean but boring lavender bomb), this version –Eau de Parfum– is much bolder and rugged. Opens up citrus-fresh for a few minutes, then takes a turn into something gloomy. I love leather and animalic smells yet Defy EdP is of a ""dirty"" type, or pungent to be precise. Lots of pepper! Maybe the earthy vetiver is playing games here as well. I'm not digging it as much as I would have liked to…",09/04/25 10:52,8B1M3

It's a great wearable leather fragrance the give you a good dose of very identifiable leather notes that make it a leather frag but doesn't overplay it and provides enough smokey amber smoothness as it dries down to meld it with today's style.

Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"This one definitely deserves more than the current rating of 3.6. Very smoky and like how few of them rightly mentioned below, this smells money.

A very mature, wealthy kind of smell.",12/18/24 08:34,Vinniejakes
Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Haven't tried the parfum yet but so far the Defy line is crushing it! I Really dig the EDT and this one takes that dry down with the vetiver and that hint of leather and dials it up to ten. The leather in this one is definitely a feature but on my skin this is a ""Blue"" Vetiver fragrance.
Off my skin the fresh orange opening fades into the backround within about an hour or so but I catch whiffs of the freshness in the air for about 2-3 hours after that .This is ultimately a peppery, leathery, dry smoky vetiver scent with the citrus blue fragrance thing just hanging out back there.
May not be for everyone as that vetiver comes off so dry and smoky. It can be thick and almost musky.

Very well done
Performs as expected of an EDP for me
Unique-Nothing in my collection smells quite like this
Versatile in the cooler months-You can even dress this up to a suit and tie and it wont be out of place
Masculine and sexy

Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"I'm a fan. The darker leathery dry down is superb. I actually like wearing it on a warmer day as the top notes really sing being quite citrus heavy.

Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"To my nose, Defy EdP is very different from the original Defy EdT.

The EdT version is generic and similar to many current popular fragrances on the market. Defy EdP, on the other hand, is unique with its leather/suede notes. Although the scent display is linear, three sprays in the morning lasted more than 8 hours on me. With every move, I got a whiff of vetiver, leather, and suede scent mixture. This vetiver/leather/suede profile smells warm and sweet, reminiscent of Butterscotch melting in the mouth; it is lovely!",08/08/24 07:02,tyleam

Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"I really like this fragrance. It's louder & overall a better scent than the EDT. It's more mature & more refined than the EDT. My only gripe is the performance. So for the first 30mins-1hr this fragrance will be very loud (depending on how much you spray). This will definitely fill up a small room for that time period. However, after that time period it drastically dials back. It's unfortunate because it is a great scent. At around the 3 hour mark it becomes a skin scent & lasts as a skin scent 4 more hours, so around 6hrs-7hrs of longevity. I personally believe that this scent can be worn throughout the year, but on hot days mind your sprays. Overall it's a good scent for the price.",03/30/24 01:31,TripleBee

Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Dry, smokey, woody, earthy, but at the same time has a freshness to it. Not a basic fragrance at all, like others have said it gives off a tobacco smell. Love the vetiver in this fragrance too that dry wood is really nice

In my opinion this is what Montabaco verano by ormonde jayne should've been....this one is much more safer and mass appealing. I'd say go with this one instead of montabaco verano by ormonde jayne.",03/13/24 22:55,Dumbplings
Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Right off the top I get earthy, tobacco-ish a little dryness, woody, aromatics, leaning clean..

The vetiver diesnt feel her as it dies in other scents. (Usually vetiver is warm woody citric for me)
I don't know that I find this peppery- like Miu Miu is on me... possibly minerally earthy would be a better word for it, no overt citrus for me/not heavily citrus in feel either - no pith, I get alot more of the aromatics down the base layers and by that time I quite like it, sorta generically nice by that time. As a female I don't think I could spare this all over and feel great - due to the dry tobacco feel I get. I wouldn't say this scent feels very leathery either- its not like a couch or leather jacket.. the leather is very background.
But a good fragrance, I get the lavender gently with slight powder way down the line.

This is an interesting non blue smelling blue scent, the opener making it original, the edt has a little if the same but far less, and that one is cleaner/freshie/aromatic/blue and sits ontop of the skin and has more sillage, the edp sinks in and is a little quieter after a while.
Good longevity for me too, summer skin test.",03/07/24 12:46,dglightblue

Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Oh, this is nice. It starts off in a similar way to other blue scents, but then veers off into leathery territory and stays there for the rest of its life. Some leather fragrances come up smelling of nothing but leather on me, but this doesn't. It's kind of peppery, but also kind of citrusy. I like it! I really like that Calvin Klein scents have a pretty common thread of freshness for the most part.

This is the best variation of Defy in my opinion - the EDT is just chemically citrusy blech, and the Parfum, while also very nice, doesn't do much more than a prominent cacao note. Like the Parfum, I really appreciate that Calvin Klein have done something different to other blue scents with this. I don't think it's going to put a spotlight back on them, but it's much better than the stuff they were putting out just a few years ago.

As with all Calvin Kleins, this is pretty good value - you can get 100mL of it for 90 AUD, or 200mL for just $20 more. So, if you like it enough, getting a lot of it won't set you back too much.

Is this going to be the blue fragrance I end up buying?? We shall see.",12/07/23 00:56,Andasu

Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"To me this fragrance smells how I would expect the parfum version of D and G K to smell. It’s in a similar style to the edp but much darker. I would avoid wearing this is high heat situations but it still has some summer wearability. If you are a fan of K this could be a good pickup for the right price as it smells like it could be a flanker. For those seeking leather, look elsewhere. This is not at all a leather scent although it does have some noticeable traces",07/20/23 18:17,gbreier10s
Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"EDIT: Some more things to add, the drydown is very similar to K EDP by Dolce & Gabbana, a fragrance that I am not a fan of, because it is too bitter. However, Defy gets a pass- and is 100% more palatable in my opinion. My take is that Defy is the sweet younger sister of K, whereas K is the macho older bro. Defy is not a projection monster, but it does good. And enjoy that mandarin top note while it lasts- it is absolutely the icing on the cake for this fragrance! After that, there is a huge K-reminiscent drydown, only better in my opinion. I'll lower it to an 8.3 for factoring in a huge similarity to K EDP, since the drydown isn't as unique as it could be. Defy EDP is still a great pickup at a rackstore- wholly recommended!

Holy hell I love Defy EDP so much. My first buy was a 1.6 oz for $30 bucks at Ross. For that price, I thought it was a great deal. I ended up buying another bottle as a backup (thinking that it was 1.6 oz), but that bottle was $40- and as it turned out- twice the size (what a treat!). If you see it, BUY IT at a discounter while you still can. 3.3 oz for $40 bucks is a great target price. As much as I love this fragrance, I still recommend that you test it in Sephora (@ Kohls) first, because it might not be for everybody (I am a 20/yo male, it suits my age well). I first noticed Calvin Klein Defy EDP as I was casually fragrance testing in Sephora. This is where it first caught my attention- as a sampler on display. And it was love at first smell.

The leather note is prominent, but not overwhelming. It is blended very finely, especially the leather and vetiver. Take all of the notes listed for this fragrance, and blend them so that none of them smell like their individual parts; but each combine to create a sensual, alluring fragrance that is unforgettable. Some fragrances overdo it with top notes, or have distinctive elements that stick out too much (I'm looking at you, Cool Water- even though that drydown is what makes it). Defy EDP doesn't smell overly sharply of mandarin at all, and isn't overly spiced with pepper. It is just right, with a beautiful opening.

One con with the fragrance is that, perhaps, I can see where the previous commenter compared it to a body spray. It does have that ""generic"" vibe to it.. but I love it so much, even so. Imagine walking into a mall, perhaps a clothing outlet. This fragrance might evoke those memories. Then again, the ""outlet store""-esque scent probably has something to do with the fact that the mid notes (leather and suede) are both used for certain articles of clothing. If you are afraid of blind-buying this fragrance, remember that it is relatively easy to find (heavily discounted) at rack stores, and just check in with their return policies before you buy it. Quality assured.

The longevity isn't perfect. The performance is fine, it gets the job done. But this is Calvin Klein we are talking about. I am partial to the house; i've smelled CK fragrances and consider them ""hit or miss"". Yet I love Defy EDP, and I wouldn't hesitate to call it a signature scent. 3.3 oz for $40 dollars? Best bang for my buck in the collection.

Highly recommended. 9/10.",07/10/23 23:43,jkeating7
Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"I don't get the ""it doesn't smell like leather"" comments at all. It is DOMINANT in it's leather profile. Everything else is second fiddle here. Cool Spring weather, Fall, and any Summer day that drops under 70 this will work. Last a bit off the skin for about 4-5 hours, then gets close to the skin for another couple hours, projects for 2 - 3 hours before becoming more of a personal bubble within a foot.

I haven't worn it out yet and will probably sell it before I do, could see someone more mature (30's, 40's) wearing this, but not teens or early 20's. Would probably bode well for professional workspace environments with 2 sprays max, even 1 spray is probably enough for most purposes.

Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"I grabbed this at Burlington for $35 cause it has been a few weeks since stopping at a rack store. I already really liked K EDP since it is different and easy to wear, versatile, signature worthy imo. I feel this is the Farenheit Aqua version of 2022. CK did a great job mainstreaming a blue frag, EDP, unique with the earthiness mixed with sweetness, anyone can pull it off, easy grab and go leather frag....I am glad to have it. It's 4-6 hours, never goes beyond 2-3 feet, but leaves a nice little trail later into the day. Good job by CK doing there own thing, not just go in the same direction of everyone else...I can't wear leather frags, not a fan personally of ombre leather etc......I like Leather/Suade in light sweet frags at times, but this is a great Gucci Guilty Green style scent that just works......I don't see how it is possible K and DEFY are not hyped online like other reduntant new relases and remixes. K EDP for $35 is a quality buy for anyone who wants a mass pleasing easy to wear blue leather, earthy, but sweet the right amount...If you like any of the King line, EDP best imo and this is a must have to have in the rotation. It's different enough to the average 90% of people.",04/24/23 17:05,binbabalu
Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Happened upon this in a pile of samples, and I’m pleasantly surprised. It’s much more compelling than it has a right to be. At the start I get creamy citrus and coconut with the darker elements buzzing at the edge, and the leather gradually takes up more space. I get the reference to Gucci Guilty Absolute below. I find a similar bandage accord lurking here to counterbalance the more conventional notes. After a couple of hours this calms down into a masculine coconut-vetiver that hovers at skin level.",04/24/23 14:02,BenDayDot
Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"The only difference I can pull in comparison to the EDT is that this has the Vetiver amped up with an oak note as well or maybe it's that suede saffron blend. I don't get any leather. For me the EDT is more wearable. Both good performing.

Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Can't deny this is versatile and very over sprayable. The citrus hits you nicely in the opening but unfortunately gives too much room to the woods and base notes too quickly.
The smell itself is good, nothing too unique, and very ""orange.""
Performance is pretty average (on the lower side) and does not call too much attention on my skin. I have a small sample of it that I've been wearing for the last two days. This feels a bit too non-linear and much overpriced at retail ($100+ for the 3.3oz) with the performance that not many would go for even on a fresh warmer temperature scent.

Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"This is one of those fragrances that while not being too showy or flamboyant somehow becomes quite compelling. There's an understated elegance here despite being a modern type scent, this is actually a decent release from a brand which IMO gets unfairly trashed by fragrance snobs and reviewers. I'll definitely consider buying a bottle at some point to keep alongside other excellent (and probably more unique) CK releases such as Obsessed for Men Intense EDP and CK2 in my collection.

Just to add, the leather vibe here is just right, not dirty or oppressive, so people who don't usually like this note may even like it here. This isn't revolutionary but it's a likeable & versatile modern masculine fragrance which lasts surprisingly well.",01/31/23 03:43,Dark Owl
Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Received a sample of the EDP from Macy's. Never tried the EDT so I have no way to compare it against that but it's a fairly linear, fresh, and versatile fragrance. It has a simple note breakdown and you can definitely smell some components of each of the listed notes. With the leather and it being an EDP there is enough density to pull this off in cooler months. The leather is not an older dirty leather, its more of a smoother leather (think brand new modern car leather). The only time I would probably not reach for this would be in the dog days of summer in 80+ degree heat. I wore it a couple times and the compliment factor wasn't high like a Dior Sauvage or Dylan Blue but I did get an unsolicited ""you smell nice"" compliment from someone at work. It's not a monster projector and the longevity is just so so (about 6 hours). If you have a vast niche collection you would likely be bored from this. If you have some niche but mostly designer and you are in the market for a versatile ""dumb reach"" scent it might be worth a try but I am waiting it out until I can find it at a rack store or online discounter. I don't see enough value to justify full retail because it's a like not a love and I already have enough similar fragrances.

Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Don't miss this one because of your opinions on the EdT! I usually ignore CK releases, but I am glad I gave this one a chance. The Defy EdT struggles to get any mention in the blue fragrance space because it cannot compete on any metric. The EdP is a different story.

This fragrance is a pleasant and soft woodsy and leather scent that has moderate performance, and a very competitive price-to-value ratio. CK fragrances tend to under-perform, lasting maybe 3-4 hours, leaving no trace. Defy EdP has a bit of that CK pedigree, in that it does not project strongly, but that intimate cloud is alluring. I'm experiencing 3-4 hours of arm's length scent, and then it retreats to a soft, intimate scent for another 3 hours or so. That's why I would recommend this fragrance for an understated user.

Defy EdP is best suited to casual or intimate wear, for a person that is looking to have a comfortable scent. The real appeal of Defy EdP is that it is widely available, is getting overlooked due to associations with the EdT, and is a fraction of the price of other frags in this space. If you're looking for something along this scent profile, Defy EdP is a smart buy.",12/31/22 14:43,Azure Eye
Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Smell Oranges & a Blue Vibe in the opening. There's leather there for sure, mixed with woods & to me the woods are coming across as a cedar-like wood or a sandalwood similar to Santal 33 but it could just be the way the leather is mixing with the Vetiver. I'm getting some Sage, Musk & Amber, but they are not listed, but apparently Saffiano Leather can come across that way. Dries down leathery with Vetiver. The blue vibes stick around for a while but in the background more so.

Projection is not super heavy. It sits fairly close to the skin. Longevity is average, with it becoming an extreme skin scent in around 6 hours or so. Sillage is weak. People have to come fairly close to you to smell this. I got this for $40 for 100ml from Burlington. I don't mind it for that price, but its definitely not worth retail prices. If you have a huge collection, or like huge performance, this may not be for you. It's a decent fragrance that lacks uniqueness and that ""wow"" factor. Could be worn anytime or occasion as long as its under 80 degrees IMO. Presentation is the same as the OG but with a dark blue gradient and the glass is heavy. Box is basic, sprayer is standard, cap locks into place but is plastic and reminds me of the L'Homme Ideal caps in basic black.",12/20/22 19:59,btd069
Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Really a nice one; I personally think it deserves a higher rating than its current (at the time of this review) 3.42. A very well-balanced citrus and leather scent, which doesn't lean too far in either direction. The bottle design gives the impression of a typical ""blue"" freshy, but that's not what this is. It has a lovely smokey quality. Sexy and masculine.",12/17/22 00:04,XOXO_marcel
Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Defy EDP is really good; certainly, it's much better than its current Perfume Rating in the mid 3's, and don't let the deservedly poor reviews of Defy EDT dissuade you from sampling this EDP. IMO, a very pleasant spicy-leather scent that leans citrus fresh. Performance is very good. The more I sniff, the more I like. I'm seeing 10 ml spray bottles for $19, so the price is reasonable.

Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,too weak which is a shame: fragrance wise its decent if not somewhat generic in the sea of generics noiw a days but the real sadness is its not strong at all...if they had made this beastmode it would be worth the $40,12/07/22 17:48,smellsbells
Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Defy Eau de Parfum is an okay release but somewhat uninspiring due to its lack of creativity. Defy Eau de Parfum smells like a generic version of Gentleman Intense without the quality and sophistication. Defy Eau de Parfum is a masculine fragrance that could be worn year round but is probably better suited for spring/fall/winter seasons, day or night and worn in practically any situation. Performance and projection are solid.

Defy Eau de Parfum may be a good choice for newer noses. Fragheads and/or experienced noses should steer clear unless your goal is to amass a gigantic collection of fragrances, and/or if you simply enjoy the Defy line.",11/03/22 10:50,seldomseen
Defy Eau de Parfum Calvin Klein,"Ugh another decent smelling Calvin Klein with no performance, I got a sample and have worn it a few times ....the scent is enjoyable is a smokey citrus that dries down to a actually decent leather scent but it's disappearing quickly by 2-4 hrs its barely a skin scent this seems to be a downfall of a lot of Calvin Klein scents but the few hours you get, this is a cooler weather probably leaning towards a night scent .....I wouldn't pay full retail for this but at this point that goes for all Calvin Klein Fragrances",10/24/22 18:35,RLB1979

CK One Platinum Edition Calvin Klein,"Sweet woody.

That's the definition of this fragrance. Sweet first; woody after.

And I love it!

Not surprised at all there are cinnamon and apple notes in here. Just beautiful!

But it smells like wood plus cinnamon on the dry down. The opening has apple, cardamom, vetiver, and very little lavender. There is a trail of amber here too, but luckily it is not distracting.

Too bad it is no longer being manufactured. One would be wise to pick this up should one see it in a store.

Longevity is acceptable. Lasts longer than CK One, though smells nothing like it.

Leaning masculine. Women can wear this if they really want to, but in all seriousness, there are a ton of other feminine and unisex fragrances for the ladies to choose. I still think this one is more male.

Perfect for spring. Distinctly reminds me of Dolce & Gabbana The One GREY, but without the incense and tobacco, and the sweetness amped up thanks to cinnamon and apple notes.

CK should make this in default production line instead of CK One Gold. I don't even know why that one exists given how scentless it is.

CK One Platinum Edition Calvin Klein,"Unbelievable - CK Platinum opens up identical to AB Blue Seduction with just a hint more juicy apple faucet.

Around the hour mark is when the fruitiness and juiciness completely dissipates and Platinum becomes a fresh vetiver ""woody"" scent.

I recommend CK Platinum for newbies who don't already own AB Blue Seduction or its cousins Light Blue or Versace Eau Fraiche. The only complaints are the 3-4 hour longetivity, but that's expected with CK fragrances.",09/09/19 12:31,LolitoLempicko

CK One Platinum Edition Calvin Klein,It reminded me of chloe' s nomade,06/23/19 06:39,Anna Karinis
CK One Platinum Edition Calvin Klein,Never owning a bottle of the original CK one I decided to give this one a shot. Compared with the hoard of acquatic freshies that have taken over the fragrance world the last 20 years or so this is quite a different take on the genre IMO and for me it works. To some this will open up as a very sweet feminine like blast of fruits and floral notes mixed with some citrus. You probably wouldn't envision gentlemen such as John Wayne or Sean Connery saddling up in the wild west wearing this scent but that's ok. This is unisex after all and for all the guys out there the best part is yet to come. A soft layer of vetiver and woods will overtake the base of this fragrance creating a darker slightly masculine tinge to the base and most of the mid. I imagine women will fall in love with the bright opening. I talked to a few women at work about this one and one said the drydown was a tad bit to masculine while the other loved it from top to bottom. This is really blended very delicately to adjust to one's skin chemistry so let it settle down before making a decision on whether or not to but this. I think if you are in your teens and 20's this will work very well for you. Again for the older folks let it settle down before making any quick decisions. Its one of the most non-linear complex scents that I've smelt honestly. For those reasons alone I see the secret of the original's success. I'm a fan.,01/08/19 16:05,stromboli77
CK One Platinum Edition Calvin Klein,"ok, just got it.

First of all, this is not like CK One Gold. This one is far more masculine. Those who said — got's to feminine vibe have no awareness of how feminine perfumes smell :D

It does have some notes simillar to CK 2, but CK2 is far more feminine.

I want to test it a bit more, but I like CK One Gold better.

Opening — Blow of masculine notes
Then — takes 30 sec to transition in a sweet smell. Not quite like Million Lucky, but probably this is where the Smith Apple comes in.
Then — Starts to change into woody notes (probably vetiver)
Then — Spices (can definitely feel them)

Ladies who like masculine fragrances would love this. Guys, anyone can pool this off. Someone said this is for younger people — no, no, no. Again, if you believe that an older lad needs to wear a crappy Dior Souvage musk, then I get your point, but this is easily for anyone at any age group.

Smells are memories. If you think old people need to smell certain way of course you'll be kicking this off the shelf.

CK One Platinum Edition Calvin Klein,"I am getting a pleasant smell which is not offensive. For me it's a mixture of flowers with some fruits. Not over citrusy like the original CK One. Not for matured men or women. Good for someone who is under 22 and in youth. It's not harsh at all. Kind of powdery and getting a smell of a fruity shampoo.
Compared with the original CK One, this one is more powdery and fruity. I am going 5 sprays with this. Which will last for about 4-5 hours.

I don’t see anbroxan listed here but this one has tons of it.",10/12/25 20:31,Epiphany_
CK One Essence Calvin Klein,"Definitely the same scent but smells and performs better than it has in the last twenty or so years. Slightly more modern...I'm guessing ambroxan has been dialed up here. It has a similar sweet, aromatic, musky, woody club feel of the 2010's blue fragrances (Bleu de Chanel, Sauvage, etc.), but it is still undoubtedly CK One. Essence also gets rid of the slightly sharp bathroom-cleaner edge that the regular version now has.

If they had released this 5-10 years earlier, I think they would have had a mega-hit on their hands. Sadly, Calvin Klein seems to be the only fashion brand these days not expanding their fragrance lines. A shame, since they have such perfume classics and a modern history to their name. Highly curious what a CK Privé line would look like.

Since CK One was the first fragrance I owned, it's quite a fun, nostalgic wear for me. Might finally be the time I start wearing this again after all these years.",09/11/25 15:22,ateneo_ldb

CK One Essence Calvin Klein,"So, where to begin with this one? Believe it or not, this is strangely similar to Issey Miyake Pour Homme vintage; the opening is almost an exact duplicate. I get tons of Yuzu, and don't know why it's not listed here on the fragrantica website. But it's here as far as I'm concerned and I'm probably confusing it with the bergamot.

There's a similarity to CK One original, no doubt. But this Essence, is ramped up. Opening starts me with a slight headache. It's powerful. I wouldn't over spray this. Issey Miyake Pour Homme does the same for me too.

As the Yuzu fades somewhat and I can only attribute this as being the bergamot, the geranium and musk come ever so slightly thru, being bolstered by the tea note. However, the acidity of the blood orange is next and this stays throughout. I don't get pepper, incense, none of that. There's a twinge of honey, slightly.

This fragrance is powerful. Many have waited a long time for CK One original to come back in strength and apparently, it has in Essence. As Essence softens, the fragrance gets more beautiful. And the bergamot comes back to the forefront as a lighter, creamier bergamot with a creamier musk. Layered with Cerruti Image, it's even tastier. 🤤

Very well done. Ramped up for sure. Longevity is near 6.5 to 7 hours on me. Sillage is about 3 to 5 feet. Price is about $65 on eBay. Much respect to the freshie king, Alberto Morillas 💪.",04/06/25 23:55,websterdaniel

Two bottles of CK One, or one CK One Essence?

I’ll be honest, I was missing that sharp, citrusy freshness that makes CK One a proper classic. CK One Essence? Well, let’s just say a thorough shower, a bit of body oil, and a decent fast-absorbing moisturiser will give you about the same longevity this one reckons it’s got.

That said, credit where it’s due—it’s a solid fragrance. But if I had to pick? I’d go for two CK One, no doubt. I mean, who doesn’t appreciate a bit of value for money?

Only it was this on my arm. I'd put cow dung on my armpits and fragrance myself with it than this trash. This smells so horrible I am genuinely surprised ANYONE likes it. Like seriously, what were they thinking when they made this?

The worst part? It lasts. So not only does it smell like ass. You have to smell it for a long time too.

I can rant all day about how shit this smells. Seriously. It is THAT bad",01/25/25 20:24,husselite

CK One Essence Calvin Klein,"Thoroughly enjoyable. Better than CK One in every way although it unmistakably shares the same DNA. It’s “CK One now that it’s an adult”.

And it’s strong. I do not understand people experiencing poor performance with this. It’s not what I experience at all. It has true parfum strength and lasts many hours. Six sprays and I still get wafts of it when moving around at the end of a work day.

It’s definitely unisex, but slightly leans masculine for me.

Perfect for the office or any setting when you want to smell great and offend no one.

I paid £28 for 100ml on Amazon, so the price is now coming down from launch. Good. A welcome addition to my collection and one that’ll I reach for often.",12/22/24 09:26,Riptide
CK One Essence Calvin Klein,"Grassy, aromatic, musky.

Opens aromatic with grassy notes, it's fresh-spicy and a little aquatic.
Notes of orange, then something green and musky. The scent is light and airy.
Smells feminine (to my nose.)
Gets a little earthy, has a slightly spicy musk.
Turns coniferous on skin, remains aromatic.
Finally has some faint woodsy notes and something balsamic.

This is unisex, but definitely leans feminine to me. Would suit any age really.
Best for the spring and summer, daytime, but inoffensive and so fine for year round wear.

Ok projection which softens significantly after an hour, lasts as a musky skin scent for quite a while (10hrs on my skin.)

Reminds me of a less masculine ""Paco,"" by Paco Rabanne.

It's not particularly exciting for me; though the performance is better than the original I feel the OG still smells better and so I wouldn't reach for this instead. There're also other CK One flankers that I prefer (Reflections, Summer 2019) so I wouldn't ever gravitate toward this. Above all it's ""OK One"" more than CK One.",12/15/24 06:02,Fortyfree

CK One Essence Calvin Klein,"Just grab online 50ml package, Ck one is my signature scents in high school, so I hv a lot of memories that the reason I purchase again after 25 years, also bcs I saw it’s Parfum intense, so wanna try how the performance compare with OG 25 years ago.
I tried yesterday, CK1E is lil more intense, bold and slightly lead to male. Projection is moderate not much different with OG, just abit disappointed the longevity, as a (Parfum Intense) concentration I think should be atleast last up to 6 hours, yes is last 6 hours but skin scents, projection last maybe bout 1-2 hours only, so I would say is not worth with price point to buy CK1E, better just go for OG bcs performance is not really big different but the price is big different.",12/06/24 07:11,adamtan888

CK One Essence Calvin Klein,"My only gripe with this fragrance is that when you screw on the sprayer, there is no cap to protect your stuff in your bag from accidentally pressing it and soaking everything. They should include at least one of those plastic fork stoppers. Or am I missing something? The fragrance in the early 90s was way better imo. It isn't bad today, but here in Spain there are similarly good options for half the money. To me this is a 3/10 purchase. The shower gel that was included in the box saved it from 2/10. It makes a relatively good gym fragrance. I was hoping for better.

Update: 100% lame. 1/10 This is just a dreadful and bad cheap fragrance. Think original 5% 4711 and 95% cheap nasty ambroxan. Absolutely not worth even the low price. This is nothing but a money grab. I do not get any of the listed notes, except a faint citrus at the beginning, then some cold nasty ambroxan, that smells like a Chinese store's plastic box section. Yukkk....",10/19/24 02:18,kigyo
CK One Essence Calvin Klein,"It’s the same story as it was with Eros Flame: that stood at 3.67 when I first bought it many years ago and which is now considered a very decent perfume by most. So it is with this one: a deeper, richer, smoother and longer lasting version of CK One which will be revered soon because it is a very nice fragrance indeed.

And it perfectly fits the role I want it to have: it is completely inoffensive in the best sense of the word. Because in most neutral, everyday situations, in a university classroom or a business meeting room, frankly, you don’t want anyone to notice your smell. And if they do, muted clean & playful fresh is a combination unlikely to cause bad impressions.",10/16/24 10:52,Pélissier
CK One Essence Calvin Klein,"The regular ck one you can buy today smells like the ck one you bought in the 90’s. Any talk of “this smells like the OG” stuff is silly. 2024 ck one smells like 1994 ck one. The one difference between the two is the diminished performance of the current version.
Ck One Essence is different in good ways. It definitely has Creed Silver Mountain Water vibes. No doubt about that. And the performance is much better than regular ck one.
Basically, if you want a better-performing, slightly modernized ck one that happens to have SMW vibes, go for it. That’s what this is.

I literally googled “Ck One EDP” to see if that was a thing because I do truly still enjoy Ck One but I wanted something with better performance. Ck One Essence came up and I pulled the trigger. It gives you that better performance, with the aforementioned tweaks. Slightly different, but still most definitely ck one, only stronger.",10/12/24 20:58,Parfum Prononcé

CK One Essence Calvin Klein,"Honestly just gross. One spray on my wrist lasted all day, despite trying to scrub it off with soap and water!

It's CK one, but even more metallic and soapy and synthetic. They're selling it as unisex, but I can't see a woman wearing this. It's the worst of masculine scents, laden with some sort of metallic, ambroxan-esque... thing. Think cheap male deodorant/body spray. The way mens' locker rooms smell after the men have just left.

There was always something a bit.. sweaty? About CK one, but this flanker honestly just enhances it. In a bad way.

CK One Essence Calvin Klein,"Haven’t really got much to say about it. Received a free sample from tiktok, and it is very fresh. Nicely fresh, citrusy even. I could’ve sworn it had lemon in it. Luckily enough I was looking for a perfume like it. To me though, it smells slightly too masculine for my liking. I’d wear it after the gym though; it’s an easy wear. Though I haven’t smelt the original one ever, if it’s remotely close, I’d probably buy.

The overall perfume opens with a green tea, citrus note. Then it’s got that dry down of musk. Scratchy, almost screechy at first. It’s quite minty too, I could definitely see a man wearing this.

Can’t complain though with a free sample!",09/02/24 03:24,swrights

CK One Essence Calvin Klein,"CK One Essence is a bit of a pointless release, you could argue. It lives off of the previous success of the original, retaining its core values but attempting to mould it into something more modern and refined. I think it achieves that, but in doing so strips away the very character which made CK One so popular.

It’s still got that scratchy, musky, minty citrus cocktail feel about it, but very much smoothed out by an increase of the tea notes. Additionally, a surge in juicy blood orange makes the overall scent a little sweeter and fruitier. I can’t deny it smells very pleasant, but I just don’t see much need for it to exist.

I will admit, I am a huge lover of CK One - no one can deny how iconic it is and despite my usual tastes, I love the original scent profile. Whilst I can appreciate the thought process of this one, you’re better off just sticking with the original if you want this sort of scent.",08/25/24 10:42,RGH01

CK One Essence Calvin Klein,"Wearing this now.

My first impressions: It feels as if Morillas dialed up the tea present in the original, removed its floral midsection, and somehow made the whole affair less radiant than its predecessor. As it dries down, there’s a skin-like muskiness accompanied by a gentle but persistent woody base. While it’s not as loud as the OG, it lasts longer on skin, but your personal mileage may vary.

If you enjoyed the original and wouldn’t mind a stripped-down ‘acoustic’ version of it that feels a touch more modern, here’s your chance.

Edit: This wears extremely well in high heat.",08/09/24 07:03,RJ Watson
CK One Essence Calvin Klein,"Finally got my hands on one from Amazon, with their seal of ""Premium Brand Sourced,"" which means it's an approved reseller (and therefore authentic).

The good: Essence definitely has the original CK One DNA -- all that 90s freshness and coolness is absolutely still there. Longevity is fab -- like 6 hours and still going strong.

The bad (for me): The ""modern"" note is, I think, a very lemony sort of ozone-y zing that seems to be found in every men's cologne from about 2014 onward (Dior Sauvage is a notable one with it). Even if I like the main idea of a cologne, I don't like that one note, at all (my brother loves it). I keep checking the pages of other stuff I smell this in, and they all show citrus notes, but to me it's not citrusy... I love orange and bergamot notes, and I love a creamier lemon (Replica's Under the Lemon Trees), but this reminds me more of the sourness that's in Demeter Petrichor...like a metal electric lemon! Ozone is what I keep thinking, not citrus.

I also find that single note to be too masculine for me, even though I quite like a lot of other scents that are conventionally called more masculine. This one somehow just doesn't feel like ""me,"" though.

I think it's very possible that my concept of that ingredient as masculine simply goes back to the fact that it's been in SO many guys' colognes for the past 10 years. However, despite any of that, I also just don't like it -- on anyone. I think D&G Light Blue for women has it, too, and Juliette Has A Gun's Juliette...and I'm just not into it. Too sharp and I wrinkle my nose at it.

Good or bad depending on your needs: Sillage is very strong, one light spritz fills the room. While I do wish the original had more sillage, this is a bit too much for me. You will invade people's space with this, for better or worse.

Anyway, CK One Essence can easily be summed up as really strong CK One plus ""that popular zingy note."" I will stick to CK One.",08/06/24 23:17,mv88
CK One Essence Calvin Klein,"So far weve learned...
1. It smells just like ckone...but also its ""modernized"".

CK One Essence Calvin Klein,"I LOVE THIS! At first spray it smells like the original formulation of CkOne. Little c and k, not the reformulated edition from 2008.

It's fresh and soft with a bright burst of citruses and tea. Very nice and calming. As the fragrance develops it becomes more warm and musky completely becoming an enveloping experience. That warmth from the musk and sandalwood are well blended.

This is the epitome of a ""your skin but better fragrance"".

On the drydown the sandalwood and upcycled musk exist in perfect harmony making this scent as easy everyday wear. Completely genderless with incredible longevity.

As someone who wore the orignal and loved it deeply..this is a respectful homage to the original formulation only made more modern. Well done.",08/05/24 06:36,septemberlibra
CK One Essence Calvin Klein,"A bit let down by this, after eagerly anticipating its release for months. It comes off as a warm CK One, it actually has the sensation of smelling warm. So imagine warm tea with musk...it's sort of odd. It's a scent that gets into the back of my throat and lingers.

I don't smell any black pepper or incense at all. It's not bad, per se. It's just not what I was hoping it would smell like. I prefer the original CK One because at least that one is refreshing, even if it is weak.

I will say that CK One Essence is definitely longer-lasting. It does not project too much but I can certainly smell it on my skin 6 hours later. It smells the most like CK One during the first couple minutes upon spraying. After that, the citrus starts to take a backseat as the other notes come through.

What's strange is that I seem to go nose blind if I smell CK One Essence too many times too quickly. I stop being able to smell basically any of it apart from the absolutely slightest hint of it. This doesn't happen to me with any of my other fragrances. Something in this has to be overpowering my olfactory system.",08/04/24 00:57,1947UFO

CK One Summer 2019 Calvin Klein,"This is another fragrance I've had for a long time, and am almost done with, but have yet to write a review on. I think subconsciously I push CK fragrances towards the more unimportant part of my frag-brain because they've been around for so long, and are usually done so inoffensively, you spray them on without ever thinking about it.

It's kind of crazy how us as our own little community on here are spread out all around the world, yet the fragrances we all wear connect us, almost cosmically. Like, for instance, before even writing this, I had just taken a shower, and afterwards I look around at what has grown into a rather large collection of fragrances that doesn't seem to be shrinking, and of all the ones I could choose, I grab CK One Summer 2019.

I spray it on, all over, because it's a clean, refreshing scent that makes me care a bit less if I have a little heavier scent cloud around me. It's a simple scent, really. I wouldn't doubt the note breakdown for a second. There isn't much to expand upon, but its interesting to see how similar the times some of us seem to choose this fragrance are. After a shower, before bed, on a hot summer day...etc.

There is beauty is simplicity, sometimes, and I think this is a fragrance that exemplifies that. It isn't divisive as a lot of others, can be worn by more people, and there is a pretty good chance someone else is wearing it in the same situations as you.

I am left swimming in a full morning of fresh, green, sunny, aquatic, green leaves bliss. I really love this scent so much, I will surely buy a couple of back up bottles.

I could see this on bright warm days but not sweltering ones. It also has a spa vibe. Quality candle burning - not too cheap, not too luxurious - not cloying - in a tranquil protected space.

I stewed on getting CK One Summer 2019 due to the similarities and then said, what the Hell? I got one and it is a great purchase. CK One Summer 2019 is the ""This is brillant, but I love this"" meme of fragrance. It is basically the prototype to CK Everyone and honestly is a better smelling fragrance than CK Everyone. CK One Summer 2019 is basically two CK Everyone sprays to 1 Ed Hardy Love & Luck (for men) sprays. That said it also smells like a number of other fragrances (as I already mentioned.)

CK One Summer 2019 opens with a citrus and watery note opening. I can't distinctly tell you what citrus it is, but I do think it is orangy as others have. The mid gives the CK Everyone matcha tea accord and it is distinctly similar to CK Everyone's. The base is where IMHO, we see the most difference to CK Everyone. I really just get the driftwood woodsy note. Now I think this is due to the fact that the musk and amber is a common skin scent drydown while driftwood is not.

CK One Summer 2019 is not unique but I do enjoy it because I love the type of scent that it is. A citrus aquatic. As mentioned before CK Everyone is nearly a carbon copy of it, but swapping driftwood with cedar. Ed Hardy Love & Luck is another scent with another similar scent profile to my nose. Calvin Klein even double downed with this idea in 2019 with the similar smelling Eternity for Men Summer release (which to my nose smelt like a more sea salty take on Love & Luck.) Zara also has a pair of releases (perhaps more but that is debated since at most it is note swaps) with similar smells. Blue Hole (their Dior Homme Cologne clone), Vibrant Leather Cologne, Vibrant Leather Summer and Vibrant Leather Eclat de Bergamot (their Vibrant Leather Cologne with a mandarin orange open.) That said, as mentioned earlier, I do love CK One Summer 2019.

CK One Summer 2019 doesn't perform that great, but it is common with CK One, let alone Calvin Klein fragrances period. CK One Summer 2019 lasts about four hours tops. I find it is a fragrance that projects OK. That said, it means it can work in work and causal settings during summer and even warmer spring days. CK One Summer 2019 is a slightly masuculine leaning unisex fragrance. I do however think that CK Everyone is a bit more usable in Spring and even Fall.

CK One Summer 2019 I find as a 7.8 out of 10 and my favorite of the CK One flankers I've smelt. I do have to get a back-up bottle of it, similar to 2020. I fully enjoy it and want it to last. Even with my amount of fragrances, I see myself wearing this easy going dumb reach a lot in summer and re-spraying it several times throughout the day.",03/27/22 19:38,mkpunk
CK One Summer 2019 Calvin Klein,"8/7/22 update: my opinion hasn't changed ... this 2019 flanker smells sweet, citrusy, and with just a bit of muskiness ... it smells very light and pleasant, and it's a perfect scent for the hot weather/summer time... you can smell the ck one dna, but you also get hint of other popular aquatic scents... the performance on this scent is incredibly weak in both terms of how strong it projects and how long it lasts ... you have to really be incredibly liberal on the sprays to get much performance out of this scent ... i took a shot at this fragrance because i've heard good things... for $20, it's a great value and smells nice, but the performance? ... yikes, it's probably the worst performing fragrance i own... would i recommend this cologne? still yes, because it smells really nice and people really seem to like the scent, on 4 separate occasions i've been asked what i'm wearing and how good it smells ... would i buy it after i've finished the bottle? sadly no, because the projection is just so poor it's really starting to bother me",02/08/22 18:15,whitekid3
CK One Summer 2019 Calvin Klein,Smells incredible this WINTER. I can’t help but think of Christmas Oranges. Maybe because I winter in Miami?

CK One Summer 2019 Calvin Klein,"On me this summer edition is more green/vetiver than aquatic.
It starts very fizzy, like a carbonated lemon water but it lasts just seconds, and then somehow the driftwood (although to me it’s vetiver) appears and stays there unmovable.
I get some light green notes and some sort of cotton/sweet note way back in the background.

For once, it doesn’t smell like the original. And that’s a plus, otherwise why bother.
I actually find this flanker more contemporary and wearable.

But is it original? Is it something you can’t live without? Something truly remarkable?
Well, no.
Like most Ck fragrances, you can’t go wrong, they are safe, easy to wear but not memorable.",09/06/21 13:47,esteban747
CK One Summer 2019 Calvin Klein,"This was a pleasant surprise, reminded me of Erba Pura but a super light, watery cologne version.

Does well in the heat even if you have to overspray. I really enjoy this and I think it's worth a full bottle in your collection.",08/24/21 11:44,Andrewthecologneguy

CK One Summer 2019 Calvin Klein,"Pretty much OK summer juice. I didn't recognise any tea. It smells like fresh sun cream or bodylotion - something familiar there is.

Price is good 20€/100ml, but for me this is too feminive and a little bit boring. Also it reminds me something that my mother-in-law wears all the time.

I would say this is better than CK One Summer 2020 but much worse than Summer 2016.

I also didn't see a 2021 release when I saw this in Kohls (at an awesome price) I had to pick it up. I have read previous reviews so this was always in the back of my mind as a possible purchase but the price sealed the deal. So essentially this was a blind buy for me and one I am very happy with!

I was afraid that this would be too masculine for me but I really enjoy it. It is a nice refreshing scent! I pick up a lime scent (well to me it smells like lime) but perhaps that is the aquatic note that I am picking up. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a refreshing non-offensive scent!",07/06/21 23:36,kaide_nj

CK One Summer 2019 Calvin Klein,"This is a very inoffensive summer banger. I would say that it does lean more masculine.

It does smell a little like a citrus iced tea during the drydown.

CK One Summer 2019 Calvin Klein,"I really like this. The opening reminds me a lot of Mandarina Duck in New York for Him. The CK is a little less sweet and has a more aquatic vibe and is a little less serious and I actually prefer it. To me, it's quite linear but that's not such a bad thing if you like the fresh sweet combination it offers. I get 1-2 hours of projection which I'm fine with. I probably wouldn't be if I bought it retail but for the current price of 13-15 euros, it's a great deal. I don't smell anything potentially annoying or risky in this fragrance so For anything under 20 euros/dollars, this is an easy blind buy.",07/05/20 15:10,sp00kie

CK One Summer 2019 Calvin Klein,"The best in Summer Collection, it smells like green tea, so take this in mind. What it did to me - this is the best sport fragrance if you want to go to the gym and still stay fresh and not stinking like you have never taken a shower. It is the best beach scent someone can imagine because we are sick of all coconut sunscreens. Take it until it is on the market.

The scent - absolutely masculine, no doubts about it, to be unisex is very controversial. No comparisons with Everyone or Green Tea, nothing to do with it because it has no citruses, fortunate for me. No apples or fruity notes, no musc, it is all about green tea and wood.

Overall: I have 5 bottles unpacked because I know it is limited edition and I will keep it so close. I love it. Everyone makes compliments and everyone loves it BUT on the skin, not the bottle. Try it, that's it",05/17/20 18:30,tuturudka
CK One Summer 2019 Calvin Klein,"This is quite lovely.

I am not a big fan of CK One to start, but this piqued my interest thanks to the bottle design. It’s such a departure from the rest in this line, and I appreciate that. I also love the simple orange lettering at the bottom of the summer logo. I decided to give this a shot based on positive reviews, the cheap price, and my interest in getting into summery scents—a category I tend to shy away from.

The tea in here is what really gives it its character. It serves as a teeter totter for the marine and wood notes. As it first developed on my skin, it kept tilting up and down. It gave me bold floral with this weird hint of something almost bodily. Probably just my underdeveloped nose In this genre. But ultimately, this is “basic,” which is what these fragrances are all about. No surprises there.

Life of the fragrance is exactly what you’d expect from a cheap freshie. It’s there for a few moments, but it quickly settles and begins to fade. This is something you will want to keep on/near you and reapply because why not? Unless you’re a collector, the quick disappearance of this fragrance from its bottle should not keep you from reaching for it over and over again.",04/09/20 16:23,matthra

I smell the water notes for a sec, but driftwood will take over and in 30 minutes, that's all I smell. I do not notice tea at all. This at least lasts about 6-7 hours. But I just didn't like it.

This beauty is very fresh and clean, and it fits perfect for everybody of all ages, it's office-safe, it will be very nice for use in summertime, but I will use it now for full winter, much snow and minus 10 degrees.

However this edition, while it has that classic summer scent, adds citrus and a hint of sweet. I absolutely adore the scent.
Unfortunately the major downside of this fragrance is that it lasts less than an hour. Possibly even less than half an hour. This is so disappointing to me because if the longevity were greater, I think it would be far more popular and unique.",09/06/19 04:30,Rutbil
CK One Summer 2019 Calvin Klein,"I can't wait for the annual CK One Summer fragrance, and I enjoyed having this one over the (short) British Summer. It worked better during the hotter days, it conjured up images of a shack by the sea. I got bright citrus notes, soft wood, and a lovely zingy tea note at the end. As the bottle would suggest, this is a fun fragrance, casual and carefree, less serious then last year's more sober release. Sadly, it doesn't last very well on skin or clothes.

CK One Summer 2019 Calvin Klein,"The sea is clean, slightly frothed. Distantly I hear cries of gulls and feel soft sand underfoot. The water is rather cold, and the sea wind blows hair and clothing, touches face.Silence. Only sometimes and I hear lapping, or the fish splashing or another small sea creature. This is how this summer scene of CK smells for me. The aroma is not a beachy type of sunbathing and exotic oil. It consists largely of mixed citrus fruits with the addition of crystalline water, but without saltiness. And so it lasts until the end, revealing slowly a light male note, which makes it a total unisex. Quiet, safe, very sea and fresh. I do not feel tea at all.

Unfortunately longevity is quite poor, so don't spend your shiny penny on it but if you're just looking for something cheap to good off with in the summer this is great and I think that’s the point of this whole line.

CK One Summer 2019 Calvin Klein,"So, I'm a big fan of CK frags in general, as they always seem to work well with my body chemistry. I've been getting into unisex freshies lately and have a soft spot for aquatics, so when I saw a bottle for testing while out shopping it seemed like a natural choice, especially when I saw matcha tea and driftwood notes.

Also, due to luck and decent moisturizing habits, my skin doesn't eat perfume. I can expect moderate longevity out of most anything that people on here vote poor to weak, including notoriously weak ones like Jo Malones.

4 hefty sprays of this stuff completely vanished less than three hours after spraying. As badly as I wanted to, I couldn't find driftwood nor matcha nor tea of any kind. All I got was a cheap aquatic reminiscent of cleaning spray or at best an air freshener. I really wanted to like this, so it was a huge disappointment.

Eternity for Men Summer 2011 Calvin Klein,"Summer again, here you go Eternity Summer, I can see they got slight improvement on the longevity, 3-4 hours on me, better projection and less sharp citrus.

The first note is mild sour citrus that smell like a combination of lime, lemon and orange, not bad, minutes later, turn to a great green scent, something like a cooling lemon glass drinks feel, remind me a lot of CK Truth Men, green grass cutting kind of scent, except this one with little cooling effect - very good and I like it. An hour later, last note appear and it is amber with patchouli mild scent and before it completely faded, a mild windy cedar scent hit me, very nice instead!

Overall, it is much better quality Summer Eternity released so far, better projection and smell very green aromatic to me - I really like it alot, if you like green notes e.g. CK Truth Men, Escape and Lanvin L'homme Sport, this is the one for you. 7/10 from me.

I remember smelling it sometime about 10 years ago and thought, this is different but still good. Not quite like how I remember and other ladies also commented on the change. Now its really changed. I'm still searching for a fragrance that made an impression on me like this did in the 2000s.",11/04/25 07:25,groove44
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I had this perfume in 2010. I was looking into buying it again, but I saw people saying that they had changed the formula. So I tested it at the mall and, yeah, it's really disappointing. If you were a girl who played with Barbie dolls in the 90s, you probably remember the Barbie that came with the little bottle of perfume. This smells exactly like that little Barbie perfume.",10/31/25 20:10,Meo122
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Not one, not two, but THREE legendary perfumers!!!! I've only recently gone back to this scent, now that it's not smelled everywhere anymore. I can't believe it's been 20 years!",10/31/25 09:44,bjer-don
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I love Euphoria. I still have quite a bit of juice in my old original bottle which I got sometime between 2009 and 2011 (got lost for a while after a move) but it has some white chalky looking stuff inside now, so I'm not sure its safe to use. I'm scared to buy another because I know its been reformulated and I'll be crushed if they destroyed it.
The juicy pomegranate, dark violet, mahogany wood, and whipped cream notes elevate this so hard. The vibe is very spicy sweet. Its a moody, elegant perfume for a dreamy, classy hottie.",10/30/25 07:00,lightbloom
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Euphoria for Women is a typical, early aughts fragrance. Sweet, perfumey, vintage doll-head, powdery, synthetic. It reminds me of one of the Ralph Lauren Romance flankers, the one in the mirrored bottle, but not as crisp.

I recently bought a decant and have it on the back of my hand currently. The plasticky doll head note is really prominent. As someone who loves spicy ambers and sweet ouds, I find Euphoria to be the complete opposite of my preferred fragrance families.

Not to my tastes but can imagine how older millennials would find the composition nostalgic.",10/27/25 03:28,Alisa1092
Euphoria Calvin Klein,parfümlere karşı ilgim ilk artmaya başladığı zaman çok popüler ve bilindik olduğu için illaki severim diye düşünerek almıştım. 13 yaşındaki birisi için pek doğru bir karar olmamış çünkü şu an 18 olmama rağmen hala sıkabilecek olgunlukta olmadığımı düşünüyorum. bu benim kendime yakıştırmamamla da alakalı olabilir ama özellikle ilk sıkıldığında aşırı boğucu ve maskülen bir koku sanki 35 yaşındaymışım gibi hissettiriyor. ayrıca zamanında çok popülerleşmiş ve aşırı yaygın küçükken tanıdığım yetişkinlerin hepsi böyle kokuyordu sanki bu da beni birazcık throw offladı bu parfüm hakkında :( biraz daha feminen tarafa kaysa bile yoğun nar ve odunsu notalar sayesinde erkekler de kullanabilir diye düşünüyorum sevebilmek için burnunuzun alışması gerekiyor.,10/27/25 02:46,elifcelik
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I thought I would like this because of the pomegranate (I love fresh berry notes) and the fresh green notes (I love the smell of grass) but it smells like a perfume heavy on white florals after a few minutes , so maybe it's the combination of the mentioned floral notes with the whipped cream. And maybe the persimmon along with the whipped cream is putting emphasis on the sweetness of the florals instead of other aspects of the floral notes. I don't know but i didn't appreciate it I thought it would be more fresh but it's too heavy and cloying and sweet to my nose.",10/19/25 04:14,Louvafae

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"This is by far one of my favorite perfumes. Despite the fact I usually go for skin scents or dewy floral scents this one is so special. It definitely smells different on different people and to different people. When I wear it people tell me I smell “spicy”. I feel like it smells like a sweet resinous amber scent. If you are gonna test it out, try it on your skin and don’t just spray it on a testing strip it will smell so different. (And don’t just judge the first sniff let it sit a minute or two). I don’t get the top notes that much, I think they fade quickly and I don’t mind at all because the base is so beautiful. I definitely get the whipped cream after it’s been sitting for a while. It seems like every perfume interprets that “amber” note differently, but this is always what I imagine and Ambery perfume should smell like. Lasts forever especially on clothes. Love it so much.",10/03/25 21:17,Honeymoon6

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"A lovely scent that lasts a decent amount of time and yet it's so disgustingly overpriced for what you actually get. Overpriced and overhyped, simply because of the calvin klein brand. Buy a cheaper dupe if you can because the scent is pretty good but for the love of god do not fork over so much cash for a brand.",09/18/25 13:14,turnedAgirl
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I don't get the hype.
I got this gifted soooo many times that I feel euphoria in my dreams.
This review will be simple.
Smells like any other classy women You saw in Your childhood.
Nothing special, nothing too much.
Just classy.
(Really not suitable for younger women :D)
Edit: OH, forgot to say.
I can't seem to feel that pomegranate at alll, which is really sad, because I ADORE pomegranates smell and taste.",09/10/25 18:42,MoiCheri
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"upon first spray it's floral and fresh, but as soon as it starts marinating with your skin (within a minute, if not less) it becomes nauseatingly sweet, peppery and powdery. The floral notes stay, but do not dominate. Slightly soapy. It's a very strong scent, overwhelming and intoxicating, made me feel a little ill. I would say the vibes are feminine and vintage. although I can see how someone would see it as a youthful scent if they were an adult in the early 00s (or is into Y2K fashion).

I usually like scents that fit this description, but not this time.

The man in the shop said, unprompted, that it was quite nice and that he hasn't smelled it before.

I'm fighting the urge to wash it off, as I wanna see how it develops. I will edit if I have anything else to add.

overall I would say it's a good scent, but definitely not my thing.",09/10/25 12:07,blegh

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I missed Euphoria when it was launched, and only recently bought an old used bottle online, with the wrap around metal, as pictured above. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but Euphoria does smell a lot like the notes listed here on Fragrantica. In style it reminds me of both Angel and La Nuit Tresor, but less gourmand and more masculine leaning, which I appreciate. The start is sour red berries rather than herbaceous green on me, reflecting the Persimmon and Pomegranate. This opening is quite challenging, almost like drinking unfinished wine. I gave it another spray and go, and let the scent evolve into the more complex layer of exotic flowers, and then the resinous woods in the base. These two later phases are more intertwined than the initial tart blast. More put together. In the drydown is where Euphoria smells the most like Angel, or La Nuit Tresor, but less playful and more astringent. I love this about it, as I have been struggling with Angel and La Nuit Tresor lately, thinking my nose or body chemistry has changed with age. Euphoria gets it right. At the very end a spicy cedarwood oil quality appears, no violet or cream, and then all layers seem compressed and final. I almost think of Féminité du bois at this point. But just almost.",09/03/25 09:36,AnnaCeciliaPetersson

after seeing the notes i was excited to try this out, but i barely put the tester up to my nose before immediately putting it back. couldn't pick up any of the other notes except the mahogany and amber.

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I DO NOT CONSENT TO THIS BEING POSTED ELSEWHERE. A masterpiece. Will die on the hill of this one. The original vampire perfume, clad in furs and silk, so unbelievably “unlike” CK but I don’t mind. My mother wore this my whole childhood (other gen Z would relate) it’s exactly what I think femininity should be. Liberated, cozy, opinionated, compassionate, poetic, exotic. My mother is Persian- Jewish and has the most regal features, I feel like this fits women with Persian features or somewhat dark skin and a bird nose even better because it is EXACTLY the scent of this sort of woman, who didn’t get a nose job and isn’t a basic bitch who’s finding a perfume to wear to her next dick appointment, this is a woman who would never speak in this^ language, sophisticated and regal and has some harsh edges because she’s a woman, not a sex doll.

Totally forgot to add- my bottle is over 5 years old. I don’t know what they did to new ones. They do seem watered down and less dark..",08/06/25 20:18,étoilesdejasmin

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I’m 20 years late to discovering this perfume but it’s exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a warm, deep, floral, woody, amber and found it with Euphoria EDP. This is powerfully feminine with an alluring quality. The opening starts with a burst of rich & sweet florals accompanied by a deep amber. Unfortunately that beautiful opening quickly fades and leaves a lighter version of itself. Longevity is poor, 2 hours or less with 3-4 sprays. Spraying too much can be cloying so it’s better to touch up instead. 10/10 for the fragrance composition and 2/10 for performance. I would wear this all seasons and all times of day.

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"When i first tried this I immediately thought ""ugh, shaving foam"" and almost wrote it off. But after spending a month or two with it, its now really grown on me. I dont get shaving foam, but I get a dark woody scent with a fruity note that balances it out really nicely. I find it very androgynous and can be worn by all genders. Not very longlasting though, I get about 3 hours before I need to retouch it. But still a good one, and quite unique for an affordable designer fragrance.",06/10/25 08:35,ToadyNose
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"very interesting scent profile. it's hard to describe if i'm going to be honest. it's quite creamy and almost has a lipstick/makeup type of scent but it's the type of smell of my moms makeup pouch i used to steal when i was a kid. it's not too heavy but also not a light scent. def would be ideal to wear for colder weather. it's not sweet at all, doesn't smell feminine so it would fit both women and men. but i will imagine someone more mature would rock this. i mostly get oriental, woody and creamy notes here. it's a quite unusual scent and not something i'd usually go for but something about it is intriguing",06/07/25 11:04,kimmysonline
Euphoria Calvin Klein,A cheapie but sooooo sexy! I remember this from when I was in my teens. Managed to get a hand on an older formula since they have been reformulated.

It has an expensive unburned incense quality that dries down into a tart berries and cream scent on the skin, but holds onto some of its deep, woody, spicy notes (especially on clothes). This smells to me like growing up too fast, down to the fact that it almost smelled like a smoker when I first sprayed it.

It’s been around a while, so it’s pretty affordable now, but definitely does not smell cheap!

Squares HATE her, cool cats want to BE or BE WITH her. Life is good.

It has almost a patchouli opening on my skin. But stick with it for 10 minutes, and it’s lovely. It’s definitely giving me emo y2k femme vibes - think Evanescence in the Fallen era. And not bad, for the price!

Spicy. Fruity. Woody. And not in a good way. This one hits hard. Smells like an old lady with light blue eyeshadow and tattooed eyeliner that's fading away very quickly. She also has deep vein thrombosis and a vintage fur coat that’s seen too many decades.

It’s definitely an attention-grabber, but for all the wrong reasons. If you're into bold, old-school old lady fragrances, maybe you'll like it. Personally I couldn't scrub it off fast enough.",04/19/25 15:55,sagebelknap
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"A friend of mine uses it as one of her favourites and I cannot unlike it :-) On her, it's sexy, sultry and a bit spicy, I can clearly detect pomegranate, but the rest blends nicely into some slight fruity sweetness and a solid woody base... Yet I would bet there is a bit of thyme spicing up the concoction. I would lose this bet, of course, but it feels so exotic and nice! Also, it develops beautifully when it's hot and creates a scent bubble around the wearer. A very pleasant surprise.",04/17/25 14:38,Cadaverine
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I don't know why, but I adore this perfume. You'd think I'd stray away from this perfume as there are so many others out there that are seemingly 'better,' 'newer' and more 'contrarian' out there, but I LOVE Euphoria. I'm still relatively new in owning perfumes. Maybe it's because of the strong woody undertone this fragrance has. Maybe it's because when that woodiness is combined with the scent of pomegranate and a violet black orchid, this perfume becomes heavenly. Maybe it's because of its relatively cheap price yet strong sillage/longevity.

It's a staple in my collection because of all of these factors. This isn't a sweet or youthful perfume, and I love Euphoria for that. It's refined, womanly, and downright alluring. It has a darkness to it that I can't quite put my finger on. I find this to be a secretly bold perfume with an understated confidence that makes it both a genuine crowd-pleaser and a stand-out. Maybe Euphoria proves that a fragrance needn't be an expensive, luxury perfume in order to be 'good perfume' but one that perfectly matches the wearer's very essence and skin chemistry. An absolute love.",04/08/25 13:13,michelaahh

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein Euphoria: A Mature, Orchid-Violet Combination

Let's talk about Calvin Klein Euphoria. This isn't your typical, sweet, youthful fragrance. Euphoria is a statement. It's mature, sophisticated, and undeniably alluring. I've been wearing it for a while now, and it's become a surprising favorite.

What truly sets Euphoria apart is its longevity. This stuff lasts forever. I'm talking all-night, into-the-next-day kind of lasting power. And for the price? It's an absolute steal. You get a high-quality, long-lasting fragrance at an affordable price.

On my skin, Euphoria transforms into something truly magical. The prominent notes of orchid and violet take center stage, creating this deep, almost mysterious floral and woody scent. It's a dark, velvety floral, not your typical bouquet. This is what I love most about it. It’s a very unique scent.

I'll be honest, Euphoria isn't an everyday scent. It's a bit too intense and mature for casual wear. But for nights out, special occasions, or when you want to feel a bit more glamorous? It's perfect. It exudes confidence and sophistication.

I feel like Euphoria is a bit of a hidden gem. It's been around for a while, but it's often overlooked in favor of newer releases. If you're looking for a long-lasting, mature, and unique fragrance that won't empty your wallet, give Calvin Klein Euphoria a try. You might just be surprised at how much you love it.",03/30/25 12:19,lxsia

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"This has a luxurious quality to it that makes it feel more expensive than it actually is; I think it's because of the deep, woody mahogany note which adds richness and depth to the composition.

I’ve seen a few reviews calling it forgettable, and I do agree with that. It's strange, but when I’m not wearing it, I genuinely can't remember what it smells like. That might be because it’s still new to me and I haven’t formed a strong scent memory yet. Or maybe its just because the DNA isn't that memorable.

That said, I enjoy how it smells when I wear it, and I’m glad to have it in my collection.",03/24/25 06:35,Mandie731
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"This smells like a vague idea of ultimate feminine fragrance. Soft, powdery, forgettable, unintelligible. I don’t get any of the notes listed.

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Smelled it while Christmas shopping a while back, and loved it. Saw it was at Ross, so I got a bottle. However, it does not smell like the one I smelt while Christmas shopping at all. It smells VERY heavily of patchouli. So to me it's coming off more like the Euphoria Intense, but this bottle is definitely just Euphoria, so I'm just confused on what happened.",03/21/25 20:52,navinet
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I’ve only tested Euphoria once so far, but I like it. The opening is a bit too sweet for my taste, like jelly candy, but thankfully it fades quickly. After that, it settles into a delicate, floral, and fresh yet sweet scent, with amber blending nicely into the composition. It reminds me a bit of Idôle but a little deeper thanks to its pomegranate and woody notes",03/20/25 04:40,Szafirowy czar
Euphoria Calvin Klein,Berries and flowers. It's clean. It's sweet. But nothing really stood out one way or the other to me. There's no distinct downfall. Nothing to specifically praise. No note that jumps out or reminds me of anything specific. Normal projection and last. It's just not anything special. Very mid.,03/13/25 13:13,xaro
Euphoria Calvin Klein,the woody note is very apparent in this fragrance. i’d say overall it leans a bit unisex. it’s not for me but i know others would really like it.,03/13/25 12:47,areeba.s
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Tart pomegranate juice and dark wood are most prominent, under which is a little soapy orchid, and it's all nicely rounded out with a cosy whipped cream base note.

Clean, juicy, and surprisingly unisex. I think it even leans a little masc on me tbh.

Moderate sillage. A little more on warm skin if exercising, but it's still subtle.

5 hours or so longevity from two sprays under my shirt and one on each wrist. (Actually very impressed with the longevity on my wrists, it's survived my doing the washing up and is still noticably fragrant!)

Really does smell like a much simpler version of L’Ile Pourpre by Liquid Imaginaires. I'm going to get a bottle of Euphoria for days/casual wear this summer and save my L’Ile Pourpre for nights/best.",03/12/25 16:12,Bucket_list
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"My very first true-blue signature scent back in my University days. During the summer I would tutor chemistry and a girl I was tutoring smelled divine, so I asked her what her perfume was and it was this.

I promptly bought it and it just enveloped me. I was completely new to fragrance and oblivious to most social norms, so I tended to overspray, but I couldn't help myself.

I still haven't smelled anything quite like it.

It is dark and gothic, very deep and erotic; the musk smell from it is very spicy, earthy and carnal- as a previous review said, it does give off a very lustful feminine smell.


I couldn't figure out what to wear (getting bored of my usual rotation) and sprayed this for nostalgia. Wow. It is a bottle from perhaps, 2015, so I luckily haven't run into the dreaded current reformulation issue.

Euphoria will always be my first true love for fragrance. It defines a pivotal part of my life and still holds up. :3",03/06/25 13:24,donkrieg
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"2025 formula wearer here. Not sure what the negative hoopla surrounding this fragrance is about. *On my skin* I get fruity, nectary, violet candy whipped cream with a tinge of woody notes, not too shabby. Reminds me a lot of Shakira Dance Red Midnight which I wore a lot working as a stripper and sold lots of dances whilst wearing, ha! Do with that what you will! It’s not necessarily boundary pushing from an olfactive lens but it’s also not unpleasant by any means, I can see how this is a consistent scent folks come back to. Look into this one if you’re searching for a sensual ambery floral!

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Euphoria….I can’t get enough of you. Euphoria….the one I always come back to. Euphoria is the first perfume that I really fell in love with. All it took was for me to smell it one time and I was hooked. Whipped cream, black violet, persimmon, mahogany, black orchid, pomegranate….the composition of this fragrance is absolutely stunning. It’s floral, it’s pretty and sexy and just such a pleasure to wear. I wore this stuff all the time during my college years. I can still picture my younger self walking the halls in my favorite mesh top, long silver earrings and a sexy trail of euphoric mystery following close behind me. Someone was sure to ask what I was wearing and I was always happy to reply cause I knew nobody smelled like me. This fragrance stirs so many nostalgic feelings within me. I don’t wear it every day like I did in my younger years but I just can’t stay away from her too long. No matter the season, time of day or occasion, I’m always drawn to Euphoria.",01/24/25 00:20,StormChaserrr

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I bought a pack of testers for 7€ and chose this in the mix since I usually like Calvin Klein perfumes, but this one? oh boy, it’s one of the worst things I have ever smelled in my life. I just can’t bring myself to even sniff it without feeling like throwing up. to me, it smells like heavy tobacco or cigarette smoke, trust me, I grew up with a tobacco smoker and this smells exactly like it along with woody, dark notes and maybe the slightest hint of powdery/floral notes that are extremely underpowered and barely noticeable due the obnoxiously loud woodiness and smokey smell. I had to hide my tester away because I couldn’t stay near it at all. Incredibly nauseating :(
edit: I wanted to add that this smells like a really masculine/unisex fragrance, I don’t smell anything remotely feminine or sweet",01/21/25 18:29,Oxalia
Euphoria Calvin Klein,No.. very mature scent leaning almost unisex because of the wood. Thought it would be one of the fresh 2000s perfumes but I was very wrong. Gonna sell it.,01/15/25 23:55,Mollenon
Euphoria Calvin Klein,Not for me. Too woody and leans more masculine or unisex. I am a gourmand girly growing into more “mature” scent and I was hoping this could be it. The whipped cream and fruits - I got none of that. I gave it to my mom and she absolutely loved it. She is 29 years older than me :),01/14/25 17:46,Mulliemullie
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Review #2 after purchasing a bottle and using it several times.

I can actually notice the whipped cream. The opening is smooth and resinous. It is deep and dark but decidedly feminine instead of unisex like other similar fragrances. However, the drydown is a little too bitter to me. I wish it retained its subtle sweetness that makes it so smooth. The woody note really stands out.

Regardless, I appreciate this fragrance. It is certainly of high quality and quite bold. Keep in mind this is NOT a safe blind buy! I tested it before purchasing and still did not like it as much as I imagined. Some women may find it not feminine enough. It is not for people who hate being noticed either.

Last but not least, there was absolutely no need to alter the bottle. It was perfect. I obviously got the new one and it looks ""naked"". This is a downgrade to me. Stop screwing with iconic bottles!",01/14/25 04:05,FragranceLover00

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"A gorgeous unisex fragrance, which I honestly find quite unique. It is not generic, in the sense that is is sweet or floral. However, I find that many people enjoy the scent. It’s a sweet creamy woodsy scent with delicious florals. It lasts so long on hair and I have gotten so many compliments on how my hair smells. Absolutely love this fragrance, even more so because it is affordable.",01/11/25 01:47,cassielini
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I smelled this on an elegant older woman while holiday shopping. Purchased a sample- I’m getting berries, powdery, woodiness. Definitely best for cold weather as it is strong. Gives me glamorous new york aunt or grandma vibes, I kinda like it.",01/09/25 09:29,Turkish_delight
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"The fragrance is very mainstream, safe, and inoffensive—perfect as a gift. The fruity undertones in the opening are pleasant, gradually evolving into a floral composition with subtle woody nuances. There’s just a hint of boldness, enough to add character to the blend while keeping it easy to wear and universally appealing.",01/05/25 04:01,Marta_Regina
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Smells like 2005 for real. It's soft and powdery, but dark because of the pomegranate. The woods blend so lovely with the powder, creating this soft, deep, dark, yet still inoffensive cloud. It's a beautiful, seductive, musky scent. It reminds me of Narcisso Rodriguez Musc Noir Rose but WAY less sweet and less loud. This feels sexy in an understated way.",01/02/25 15:11,Noveight

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I really love this fragrance, in theory and practically, but I've come to find that it doesn't project too well on me. I'm not sure if it's simply just too warm where I am right now to enjoy it to it's fullest, or if it doesn't like my skin chemistry, but I feel it doesn't sit as well on me as it would for others. I definitely get the fresh greenness and juicyness of the pomegranate and persimmon in the top notes, but as it warms up I sort of find the orchid to stand out in a sort of tangy, metallic way between the lotus (which I usually adore as a softer, watery floral) and the champaca flower. I really wish I got stronger notes of whipped cream and heartier woodiness, but it dries down too quickly I fear. Maybe I'll retest this again in the winter, but definitely a super fun and flirty for those who want a moodier but still enticingly fresh fragrance. I've gotten complimented a lot on it, and my friends adore it, so it's definitely a crowd pleaser!",12/08/24 01:58,cowg1rlhoney
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I keep trying to love this perfume because it was gifted to me by someone I care about and it's the most expensive one I own, but every time I spray it, I get blasted with woody aftershave and then a very very quiet, gentle floral orchid an hour later when the mahogany stops holding me hostage. The fruity notes are undetectable. Maybe I just don't dress up enough to justify it.",12/05/24 07:28,ActuallyAndroid
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I do not have much to say about this perfume. It is pleasant, and it is a safe blind buy in my opinion. However, there is no wow moment. It is generally good for everyday wear and could be a good signature scent if you don't have one already. Smells like a woman who has her life sorted out and has sort of a motherly spirit to her, but there is also a young and nostalgic heart. There is a hint of romantic dust inside. The whipped cream is quite noticeable and smells very synthetic. Maybe without it, it would smell better. Overall the smell is quite calm but also passionate. If this perfume were a song, it would be Fire Meet Gasoline by Sia.",12/02/24 14:15,StrawberryPizza
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I was sent a sample of this along with a previous purchase of mine. I love blind buying perfume but I also appreciate the opportunity to try the scent beforehand. This was a love at first sniff. If I had to use one word to describe ""Euphoria"", it would be satisfying. Pure olfactory and visual satisfaction. I have already ordered a bottle as I am typing this.

Beautiful scent. Rich, deep, with just enough sweetness, all of which comes from the fruits and the amber. The orchid (? I guess) is gorgeous, powdery and refreshing. The green note is minimal but noticeable and sufficient. Despite being listed as a top accord, the wood is not too strong to me. It gives the fragrance depth and warmth. The persimmon and pomegranate do not smell cheap or synthetic, and are pretty close to my idea of what these fruits smell like.

I find ""Euphoria"" mature and youtful at the same time. I think it is great for people in the early 20s to late 30s range. Although I would wear it daily, I can also imagine it being perfect for nights out. It reminds me of the time I went to my coworker's wedding, got tipsy really fast, danced a lot, realized that my mom wouldn't be alive in 50 years and cried about it then drank some more. I do not go out often. This perfume reminds me there is a freak inside of me that wants to have fun and feel alive. I will wear it and imagine these moments for a few seconds then snap out of it.

Longevity seems promising. I sprayed this on my forearm and put on my sweatshirt afterwards. I could certainly smell it on my sleeve a few days later. I have other CK fragrances on my wishlist including its masculine counterpart. If I really enjoy this one, I will buy more of their fragrances.",12/01/24 04:21,FragranceLover00

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"A sweet, fruity and gourmand perfume enjoyer here, when I tested this on paper, I thought this was going to be my favorite fruity scent. But when I bought it and sprayed on my skin, I was really disappointed. It was obviously my fault that I forgot to spray it on my skin, but the difference was really shocking. It smells strong, intense with pomegranate, very woody, spicy that it almost feels masculine with a hint of sweetness. Kind of reminds me of intense grandma perfumes. Only appropriate for cold weathers, this could make you want to choke yourself if you spray this on hot days tbh. I can only see myself wearing this on night. Maybe on a cold jazz club date or a dinner. (NOT A BLIND BUY.) But I'm very disappointed.",11/20/24 04:33,I@tefelixsbrownies13
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"This has a very nostalgic vibe for me because my best friend with whom I'm not talking these days used to wear it. Somehow, though, when I smelt it recently, it really felt like a ""me"" scent. In fact, it gave me gender euphoria on a very dysphoric day.

I am non-binary, look like a girl, so I went to my local beauty store to sample perfumes and the lady (who wouldn't let me look around on my own) seemed appalled when I told her I'm looking for something leathery and woody. Not only did she think that if I look like a woman, I must always choose feminine perfumes, she also thought it appalling that wood or leather would ever belong to a traditionally feminine perfume, before going on to sample me with a perfume that was among what I was looking for and it was literally called ""This is Her"" (by Zadig & Voltaire). Last but not least, I had told her I wasn't looking for anything overly fruity or floral, so when I tried on the lovely almond-y Poison Girl by Dior she was like ""I told you I should have shown you sweeter scents!""

Anyway, rant about the autonomy of olfactory choices over. The thing is, this perfume is the exact mix of feminine and masculine elements for me. I know these are not the predominant notes, but to me it smells like a warm floral with a touch of oud. This unisex perfume really gave me gender euphoria.",11/20/24 04:29,samwindrose

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"My mom used to wear this growing up, and it will always remind me of those days. It was a mature scent, and I loved the smell. I think I was in middle school maybe when she started wearing it? It was strong….I remember going into her bathroom one day just so I could smell it lol. Definitely was one of my favorite scents growing up. Saw this at Ross or TJ Maxx and think I was able to smell it since someone had opened the packaging. Didn’t smell as strong or how I remembered it. Maybe they reformulated? Anyways, the OG bottles were something else.

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I only know CK Euphoria in its current iteration...I wish I could have smelled it in the early years, though I'm quite fond of it as is.

Put simply, I think of it as sitting at an unlikely junction between berries-and-cream and shaving cream: it is fruity and creamy while still being undergirded by woody notes and a dash of something ozonic and aquatic that keeps it from whetting the appetite. If it smells generic, it's probably because it has been copied to death -- itself a descendant of fruitchouli powerhouse Angel. On its own terms, I find it sweetly fruity, floral, and then woody; feminine with both grit and depth. Full disclosure, I have been having early aughts nostalgia BAD lately, but how I wish it were true today as it was 20 years ago that any old mainstream release you could find at the local JC Penney was this solidly good!",10/24/24 12:25,ingrid.superstar

I think this is what a supermodel's penthouse interior would smell like, and even though it's the complete opposite of my everyday vibe, I really like it.

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Euphoria was my favourite perfume since 2005. I remember the first time I tried it and fell in love with it. Such a unique, sexy fragrance that would last for ages. All these years I bought bottle after bottle and never got tired of it, it was my signature fragrance... until now.
A month ago I bought a 160ml bottle, to my surprise, the bottle had changed, the metallic part was gone and it was all glass. Ok. I spritzed it on my wrist and immediately smelled something different in the open, I can't tell what, but it smelled weaker and something was off. Then I got used to it but 2 hours later I could not smell anything. I asked my partner and he could not either. I wanted to think it was the 160ml bottle that was different, so I bought the usual 100ml. It came with the same new design and sadly the same weak opening and extremely poor performance. I sent them back, even at a good price, I am not spending £40 in a parfum that had been watered down and lasts less than 2 hours.
Such a shame, I will never understand why they have reformulate and ruin a fragrance that is so amazing? Such a disappointment, but this seems to happen with most of the parfums lately.
I will have to find a new love.",10/12/24 12:09,Xamapola

Not to mention, I've received a compliment from two people out of the 6 times i've wore it outside.

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I had a decant of this in my collection I completely forgot about. I am BLOWN AWAY BY THE DRY DOWN ON THIS BEAUTIFUL BABY!!!! It has a rather harsh, early 2000's floral/fruity opening that is rather dark. For me at least, I am lucky that my least favorite part of the perfume fades quickly and enters the star of the show... The mahogany-amber whipped cream comfort goodness. My boyfriend doesn't interpret this as a dark perfume actually, he uses words like ""pink, fluffy, cloud, comforting"" and that exactly how I see it too. There's a comment further down that describes this perfume as ""It's always given off the vibe of the tough girl who doesn't care what you think and gets the last word in, but also spends her weekend helping homeless animals with 3 legs."" When I read that I was cracking up, and my boyfriend asked if I was watching a funny video (wanting to join the fun of whatever I was enjoying) and I just read the comment to him and he goes ""that's a description of you!!!!

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Category: Floral, woody, classy, feminine.

Notes: Sprays on very fresh and floral with a warm undertone, likely from the amber base note peeking through already. Slowly but surely develops into a timeless, gentle wood scent with a touch of orchid to balance things out and give it a bit more of a fresh feel.

Vibe: Sunday brunch with the girls. Walk in the park. Floral pattern sundress. Front row runway seats at NY fashion week. Vogue. Shopping bags. Champagne on New Year's Eve. Gossiping in the girl’s bathroom. Very mindful, very demure. Gala. Early morning coffee run. Tulips.

Sillage: 6/10. This has the perfect sillage in my opinion. It's there, it's definitely noticeable, but it's not overwhelming or offensive. The kind of scent that wafts over as you pass by or becomes apparent when you go in for a hug. Definitely wouldn't say it's intimate though, just mellow.

Longevity: 3/10. Unfortunately quite poor longevity on this one. Tried this on at the perfume counter and within 3 hours it was pretty much gone, just a skin scent remaining.

Wear: Day. I’d say this likely works year round, but probably performs the best both in terms of longevity and just letting the notes shine in the cooler months of the year. Perfect for both a casual day at the park and fancier events.

Overall rating: 6.5/10. Chic and elegant, this perfume is a classic. I totally see this being worn by a leggy, fashionable Manhattanite (cough, Carrie Bradshaw, cough). The reviewers who are saying this leans masculine are trippin’ for real, there's not an ounce of masculinity about this perfume - quite the opposite, I'd actually classify it as very traditionally feminine. Something about it is a bit more flirty than your typical “classy” scents in a way that I think gives it a unique edge more fitting for a younger wearer and/or someone who is very fashion forward.

Who would wear it?: 110% SUCH a Carrie Bradshaw scent.",08/26/24 16:01,JaneBond
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I have smelled this perfume from my mother collection, very sharp heavy woody fragrance tends to be masculine fragrance for my own taste, but I like it on my mother. I think the Mahogany woods is the ingrediant which the reason of this intensive sharp fragrance, to my noise this fragrance overwhelming any other ingrediants. very suitable to wear at night.

If you didn't smell this perfume before, I advise you to not blind buy. This Fragrance didn't suitable for majority of people, needs someone interest this fragrance or someone like heavy perfumes.


لقد جربت هذا العطر فهو من مجموعة والدتي، وهو عطر خشبي حاد وثقيل للغاية يميل إلى أن يكون عطرًا ذكوريًا حسب ذوقي الخاص، ولكني أحبه على والدتي. أعتقد أن خشب الماهوجني هو المكون المسبب لكون هذه الرائحة حادة وكثيفة، بالنسبة لما يشمه أنفي فهو يطغى على أي مكونات أخرى. مناسب جدًا للارتداء في الليل.

إذا لم تشم هذا العطر من قبل، أنصحك بعدم شرائه شراءً أعمى. هذا العطر غير مناسب لغالبية الناس، يحتاج إلى شخص يستمتع بهذه الرائحة أو شخص يحب العطور الثقيلة.",08/05/24 01:01,Abeer Alatrash
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Perfection in a bottle! It's Long lasting and has this mysterious feel to it.
My mom used this a lot back in the day and I've been missing her badly since moving abroad. So she's partly the reason I got it. Beyond the sentimental value, it is an amazing fragrance, and as someone who never repeats or uses familiar fragrances, the fact that I absolutely adore this fragrance till now is a testament to its timelessness.

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"My mother's scent, so gives off a comforting smell. You know this woman, she always wears dark makeup, dark colors dominates her clothes, her laugh is heavy yet intoxicating. A very feminine and strong smell. A beautiful combination of floral and fruits. The persimmon gives off the sugary smell that complements the woodiness, turning it into an addicting smell. But that might be personal since I love the way this fragrance mixes with my mom's own smell, reminds me of being her little daughter again, watching her get ready, hoping to wear perfumes like this.",07/30/24 03:33,eylulcnar

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I was pleasantly surprised by this perfume. Much nicer and warmer than expected.
My only issue is the longevity- it has none. I spray it on quite liberally and my skin eats it up in minutes. A real shame, as I am really enjoying the few minutes that I can actually smell it on me.
However, looking at previous reviews, this seems to be a “Me” problem rather than an issue with Euphoria itself.

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I've always hated the bottle, but loved the juice. Sure the reformulation did change it a little, but on me at least it still smells like a mahogany cabinet and a fluctuating combination of fruity, patchouli, creamy, and spicy. It's always given off the vibe of the tough girl who doesn't care what you think and gets the last word in, but also spends her weekend helping homeless animals with 3 legs.",06/27/24 14:27,rebarm
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Daring, intoxicating and erotic. When you first spray it its SPICY. It starts off kind of unisex but as it dries down it becomes more feminine and sweet. This is a unique sweetness though. I have never smelled persimmon or pomegranate in perfumes so this scent was so unique to me. Its kind of a green sweetness. I like assigning mythical creatures to perfumes and this would definitely be what a succubus wears.",06/23/24 18:15,m0userella
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"There is an element of tobacco in the dry down that reminds me of the smell of cigarette smoke on clothes after a night at the pub in the 90s - in a good way (and I don't like the smell of cigarettes at all).

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I tend to be drawn to stronger scents as my body chemistry tends to dampen many of the more musky and cloyingly sweet vibes. Perfumes and colognes that smell delicious on me tend to be ones that are rather divisive. For example, my current best performers are Farenheit by Dior, Poison by Dior, Sauvage by Dior, Red Door by Elizabeth Arden, L'Eau D'Issey by Issey Miyake, and now Euphoria by Calvin Klein. On me, the strong fruity notes fade quickly, leaving only green accord, florals and the woody base notes with a hint of sweetness from the whipped cream and amber notes. It has surprising longevity on me, about 7-12 hours which is one of the best in terms of performance I have encountered. Sillage is about 6 feet from me - if I wear this you will smell my arrival in a room. I wouldn't wear this if I worked in an office, but it is a perfect scent for a weekend spent shopping and spending time with family and friends. It is a comforting, loving scent that gives mature vibes (opposite would be how Poison smells on me which gives gum-chewing carefree teenager vibes). I would wea
r this to daytime, spring, summer, and outdoor events. I think it doesn't have enough heavy spice or strong florals for me to consider it a winter scent. I feel like without the added boost of warmer weather, this perfume would fall flat on me as many of my favorites do (I'm looking at you, Like This by ELDO). That said, this was a gift, and I don't know if I will replace the bottle I have once it's gone. It's good juice, imo. I would give it 8.5/10 overall.",06/15/24 23:47,Xtremenergy88
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I got this perfume as a gift from my manager, who I talked about my newfound interest in perfumes with. She had the bottle lying around, and since it was a perfume with a purple color to it, she figured it would make a great gift (purple is my favorite color, which is easy to guess if you look at my profile and collection). She was right! I really appreciate it :) Also, don't worry, she said she was fine if I didn't like the scent, so I will now give my unfiltered opinion
It's very... interesting.
It's not a love or a hate, it hovers between like and dislike.

Likes:
The bottle is cool. It's aggressively 2000's, which can be a little tacky. I love that the liquid itself is purple.
I like the top notes/first impression. It's a bit screechy/metallic, but I like how it's cool, floral, green, and a little fruity. This is where I pick up on the darkly sexy vibes people are talking about. It smells avant-garde in a sophisticated way. The patchouli-like quality got me a compliment from a customer the first time I applied it, so it at least appeals to some people. I think I have an outfit in mind that would suit this, so if I remember to coordinate it, I'll update here.

Dislikes:
Creamy drydown is overbearing in my opinion and it erases most of the green and woody notes. I know a lot of people love the creaminess, but I'm really not a gourmand person. Definitely smells more mature than I think I want to convey. I'm a 22-year-old woman who's new to perfumes, so I'm leaning toward things that feel around that age and are also pleasant both to me and to other people. Sometimes I think the smell is mature in a 30-year-old woman way, but other times, it definitely falls in line with the idea of an old lady perfumes. It's also very easy to get sick of. I smelled the bottle too many times while writing this and will have to put it down for a day, haha.

Overall:
I think my score will shake out to about a 3/5? The first impression occasionally reaches a 4/5, but also feels like a 3 sometimes. The creamy drydown is a 2, and the indolic (in the overripe sense) feature is a 1 or 2. Maybe 2.5 is better?
It's definitely not a hate, I'll say that. My one true hate is Tom Ford's Black Orchid. lol

Side note: I cannot speak to the seasonality of this fragrance. I live somewhere without four true seasons, I only first saw a real autumn with widespread leaf color changes last October, and I haven't seen snow since 2009.",06/13/24 19:31,EstelleLavender
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"The only person I’ve ever known who wears this is a very masculine guy friend of mine, and he says he gets a lot of compliments from girls about how he smells. So take with that what you will. But to my nose, and on my skin, this opens to an almost watery pomegranate with an almost bitter undertone, and an almost floral pop. This scent is a lot of almosts. It’s just not quite what I want. It’s meh.",06/11/24 00:37,Lykopa
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I could cry. This was my signature scent for the majority of my adult life… until the reformulation in 2017.

They have completely ruined what was once a beautiful experience, thanks L’Oréal (I hate you).

The OG Euphoria used to constantly get me complements, and the smell lasted all day with incredible silage. It used to be the most sexy, lovely, feminine scent…. Oh how I miss those days.

The new reformulation smells so cheap it makes me want to vomit. Nobody should wear any of the Euphoria perfumes, unless you are trying to prank or repel someone.",06/07/24 08:16,JesScent

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Wow. Iconic for a reason. My mom wore this for special occasions when I was a teen and it distinctly reminds me of her loving arms waiting with flowers to congratulate me after my musicals or dance recitals. So I do get the association others have with older maternal women.

BUT when I smell this objectively (and in loving memory of course) this is a very sexy and witchy scent. Also, my mama was no one to f**k with. This is sharp, woody, a little tart and spicy but with an addicting sweetened base. I think whipped cream was so smart in this composition because it lends a sweet creamy note perfect for the fall/winter but it’s more cool whip than dense vanilla icing, keeping it airy, whimsical and a bit dry. This is not a gourmand especially in today’s gourmands, but it is like forbidden fruit. Decadent, rich, and well rounded.

I love that the ads for this are just women climaxing in flowy purple gowns lol It really does have a raw sensual quality- quite naughty and dangerous! I feel like Sharon Stone smelled something like this in Basic Instinct. Love love love.",06/05/24 22:20,jdb_

I'd say its a clean/casual aesthetic rocking a Little Black outfit on a night out pulling out their glamorous yang to their clean yin.",04/21/24 01:45,Classiclover84

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Nostalgic Tart Pomegranate with Sugar-Crystal Texture & Evoked Patchouli...

This doesn't get a lot of love in the reviews, but it was groundbreaking when it came out and won a FiFi award for Fragrance Of The Year Women's Luxe 2006. I remember being mesmerized with it when it came out, and smelling it now it really takes me back to that time period, although it's a lot more tart than I remembered. I could imagine Angelina Jolie wearing this in the film Mr. & Mrs. Smith, which came out the same year. It has those same qualities as the film of being sweet, tart & frozen in time. The film was also sensational when it came out, due to the introduction of Brangelina.

Opens with a tart & fruity pomegranate with a sugar-crystal texture, purple/violet tones & green accents, but already the orchid, mahogany and what smells like patchouli are swelling through. Other reviewers have also mentioned smelling patchouli here (although it isn't listed), being built by green notes in combination with mahogany to give a deep, dark-green patchouli vibe with licorice-y facets. As it's drying down, the tartness settles a bit, and I get a faint whipped cream note. Overall, I get a tart, sugar-crystal textured, sour-purple/pomegranate scent with licorice-y wood/patchouli underneath. Performance is well above average for year round wear, although the tartness may verge on too tart in warmer weather. Those who enjoy tart purple/violet & patchouli scents with strong performance might like this. Enjoy!",02/26/24 11:50,suzanne_ronald
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"A friend gifted me this many years ago. Unfortunately I could never wear it, the smell is so strange. I get some dark spices, maybe liqurice or fennel. It’s not feminine, neither masculine. It’s just weird and unpleasant.",02/25/24 10:44,Luilind
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I really wanted to like this and I gave it many tries. I love it on other women and I expected it to give me the same sexy, sophisticated, confident vibe, but it just doesn't work on me. It's way too sharp and masculine in the beginning, later it turns much sweeter and then I start enjoying it, but it doesn't last very long. The dry-down is, again, sharp and chemical. Definitely try before purchasing.",02/21/24 03:28,IVamp
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"The fact that I actually smell the violet in here ruins it for me. Fragrances with violet ALWAYS remind me of hotel lotion. If they somehow removed the violet, it'd be (even more) boring, but I'd wear (not buy) it.

Edit: I actually wore this around the house today and my God it is headache inducing. I did not realize how strong this was. It's a Woody floral with a soft spice. But again, something about it reminds me of those watered down highly fragranced lotions from the 90s. It's headache inducing.",02/20/24 12:18,JKanyce
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"It's a beautiful acent but way too strong, heavy and mature for me. It's some late 30s and over. But the scent is nicelt blended, a deep floral scent that's not boring thanks to the woody notes",02/12/24 03:11,Gabriella.0
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Hmmm this is a bit difficult to be impartial on because I have so much nostalgia attached to it.

It's heavily sweet. Way too sweet.
The florals, particularly the violet can be quite cloying and the base is slightly nauseating.

It's really missing something a bit more savoury or bitter to balance it out. It's very un-fresh.

With that being said, it is quite sensual and attractive. I always think of that slightly glamorous feeling of being in a bustling airport when I smell this for some reason.

VERDICT:
A wonderful trip down memory lane. I wouldn't wear it anymore.
Still a 'like' simply out of respect to my teenage self, and my somewhat dubious perfume taste back in the day.",02/08/24 08:45,smelling.sniffing.swan
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Nice one😁. I'm into my second bottle but honestly i 'm a bit done with this perfume. I will finish but not purchase again. But projection and longtivity are moderate in comparison with early editions. Sadly that's the case with all perfumes with every new reformulation the juice becomes weaker and weaker. My beloved l'eau d'icey, dep red, ultraviolet, contradiction are on my off list just because of their weak projection and longtivity with todays formula.

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"This is absolutely not a winter scent, maybe a fall or summer scent? Regardless I've smelt this on three separate women and it smells God awful. When they first spray it it's so intense it's sickening, the first opening notes there's no fruity or sweet notes, it's just a projectile of plastic, synthetic, white notes and that's all I ever smell on all three of them, then it completely disappears even when close to the skin.

I tried it on myself giving it the benefit of the doubt and it's the exact same. Never in my life have I smelt a perfume so ugly",01/18/24 19:04,SickenedButCurious
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"This fragrance has a trail of nostalgia, presumably due to it being a popular 2010s fragrance. I don't love the initial spray, as it's far too masculine for my taste but I like the way it lingers when it has dried down into its woody, patchouli base. This is a more complex fragrance, meaning you can't layer it as easily without completely overshadowing its essence. I think it's very nice for fall time, but overall it is more masculine and I wouldn't recommend it to those looking for a girly fragrance. This reminds me of a businesswoman at a bar after a long day.",01/13/24 14:00,bambieu
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"This is a review for the first edition release in the bottle that looks exactly as in this Fragrantica page. I first smelled this scent on a magazine scent strip. I remember I was enchanted because all I could really smell was the fruity accords - pomegranate and something that smelled like red berries. It was soft subtle but sweet. It's different on a piece of paper and it didn't really get into a dry down. Also smelled violet. So I went to the Macy's store to check if they had it and they did! The sales lady sprayed some on my wrist because I already smelled it on paper. On my wrist it was different. The violet popped out and some other vague florals, orchid and something 'pink' and light (lotus?). Then I continued to let it wear on my skin and it became woody. It's definitely a light wood and amber dry down. This is actually quite a simple fragrance. But it was making a statement. It's sexy and mature but not old lady; more like late 20s and into 30s a confident woman who wears sexy cocktail dresses and make up. She is very feminine. It goes with high heels and a sexy low cut dress. This is a scent of temptation and feminine sexual power. If I smelled this on my man like if it rubbed off on him from another woman I would totally lose it and immediately send him out of my life! The woman that wears this fragrance well can have any man she wants. The initial note is again the fruity notes of pomegranate and persimmon. They are deep and juicy, exotic, and with that orchid even more exotic. The florals blend in with the fruit and they are fresh and soft florals that shy away and do not come off as too floral or strong. But definitely orchid and lotus. Instead of being tropical it comes off as more a dark woodsy floral scent. The note of mahogany eventually settles on you as the dry down begins. By then it is warmer and becoming woodsy plus the amber. Then there is a touch of dark warm musk. This is a soft leather musk. Because of this it's warmth is suited to colder months like winter time but also fall and at night time. These dry down notes are what keep this fragrance from becoming too girly girl or too much like a Victoria Secret perfume. But in a way this is still like a more full bodied VS perfume. The dry down is bold and makes me want to just go out and get what I want. This scent is evocative of the night. It asks you to put on a hot sexy outfit and go out at night, for a dinner or night club dancing. It's seductive to your own nose and others. My boyfriend loves this on me and he will always associate it with me and only me.",01/12/24 23:02,evavidal62
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"i left a comment before it came in the other day, so i am back for an actual review.

like i had anticipated, it took me back to my mother wearing it in the 2000s. i currently am very stuffy and can’t breathe very well, but i can smell it perfectly. i can only imagine how it smells with my nose cleared!

i was just sitting in bed while have been wearing it, and my boyfriend said “it smells good in here” from across the room, so it has a very good silage. apparently it filled the room!

it smells like a dark hair women in pretty black dress, drinking a fancy cocktail. it’s definitely more mature, but i’m only 21 and i feel amazing wearing it. i see it being something for special occasions/nights out/dinners and such, but it could also been worn daily imo. i might come back when i can fully breathe, bc i have a feelings it’s even stronger than i can sense rn lol.",01/12/24 18:19,avaphelps

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"this is my “pre-review”
i just ordered euphoria on fragrancenet (which i highly recommend for amazing deals on designer fragrances), bc it’s what my mom wore. she passed away in 2008, and as soon as i saw the bottle, i recognized it. i needed it instantly!
i don’t quite remember what it smells like, but i know i’ll recognize it as soon as i smell it. i can’t wait to smell like my beautiful momma, i miss her so much.
i will come back and review when it comes in, i am so so so excited! it also has the purple box and details on the bottle, which was my moms color, as her birthstone was amethyst. it has so many good reviews as well, so i’m even more excited for it.
i mostly got it so i could be reminded of her scent, but even better if it smells amazing and becomes a scent i want to wear.

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"i will admit this scent is a bit cloying at first spray, like kind of sickeningly floral. but after a minute or two of letting it sit it becomes one of my all time favorite night out perfumes. it's a really sexy combination of powdery, sweet, florals and dark, smoky, wood notes. the fruity notes everyone describes don't really show through with my skin chemistry but that makes the scent feel more unique than it seemed on the tester.",01/01/24 10:36,ivywine72
Euphoria Calvin Klein,My mom gave me an almost full bottle of this one. She said it was just ok but she didn't love it on her. I tried it and we both agree it smelled so good on me. I usually don't do well with woody perfumes and I wouldn't personally have chosen this one for myself but this one is the exception. I can definitely really smell the pomegranates and the violets on me. A surprise find and definitely a keeper!,12/31/23 06:31,Fainkfrag147
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Very strong, intense, rich fragrance. For me, this makes it a dislike - I usually love a fruity floral, but the deep woods in here overpower all.

I could see Euphoria being a cold-weather night out fragrance for someone, but that someone isn’t me.",12/29/23 11:51,meganlamode
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Not as fruity or floral as one might expect, more woody (at least on my skin), but still has a clean and light sweetness.

I affectionately refer to it as my 'f**k me perfume'—forgive the bluntness, but there's something about it that just works like magic! It's a potent blend that exudes sensuality and strength. The lasting power is incredible, and its sillage is top-notch. But fair warning, if you're sensitive to strong fragrances, this might not be your cup of tea. It's definitely not a blind buy; its intensity is not for the faint-hearted. There's an undeniable allure, a strong and seductive quality that accompanies every spritz. It's bold, it's lasting, and it's become an integral part of my nighttime allure.",12/22/23 13:46,demi1504

I didn't always get this association on subsequent wearings, and haven't worn it a whole lot, but thought of it and trying it again today during the pre-Christmas season I'm getting some of that again! Win!

Sadly, as with all my favorite perfumes over the years, it’s been reformulated into something nowhere near the beautiful sensual beast this used to be back in the day...

I literally would do anything for a bottle of the OG Calvin Klein Euphoria....

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I guess I am my mother's daughter because this was her signature when I was growing up. That may also contribute to my bias when I say this is absolutely amazing.

First spray/opening can be daunting, but after it settles into amazingly alluring deep and beautiful sweet floral woody goodness.

For a while I have been desperate for a frag that satiates both my sweet tooth and my love of depth and richness - without leaning too hard into either one. This fits the bill for me, and I feel like a femme fatale wearing it. Chef's kiss",12/02/23 18:03,heartsparks
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I have two bottles of Endless Euphoria, which I really like; it's inoffensive, can be worn at work and doesn't project too much. I tried Euphoria some time ago and hated it; too heavy and too much - decided to give it a wide berth. Today, whilst walking around shopping, found Euphoria and some other perfumes on Black Friday promotion, and picked up the Euphoria bottle and sprayed it, and initially it was overpowering and harsh; however, within 20 minutes it had mellowed and I actually like it - not enough to buy it, but it's perfectly acceptable, and certainly has longevity and sillage as I can still smell it some four hours after initially applying it.",11/25/23 06:01,HippyDippy57

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Does anyone remember Sonia Kashuk's line of fragrances sold at Target? I liked them all...but I LOVED PURPLE SEDUCTIA!!! Like all of the one hit wonders that come through Target Sonia Kashuk's fragrances, lotions and shower gels got clearances out...not because they weren't any good, but I guess old Sonia decided to get out of the frag biz. I bought up ever bottle of fragrances, lotions and body washes as I could find on major clearance...we're talking $2 or less each! Purple Seductia was scarce, as my guess is that it was the most popular of the line. After years of using my two bottles, sparingly, I came to the bitter end. My husband is due back from military deployment and No Purple Seductia...what shall I do??? It's his favorite on me!!! Well, 9 times out of 10 Fragrantica comes to my rescue. How, you may ask? A few Fragranticans suggested Calvin Klein's Euphoria as a great dupe. So I took the leap and took the plunge....AND THEY WERE RIGHT!!!! CKE is the perfect dupe for SK PS.

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Even though it is such an old fragrance, to this day it remains my most complimented fragrance from both men and women. The sillage is beast mode and not to mention how amazing the price is and the value you receive! It is perfect for the day and evening, for university or the club, for dinner or lunch... its an amazing daily perfume. I have not smelt any perfume like it since I bought it a while back. The violet, orchard, cream and amber go so well together to make the most sexy, spicy, yummy and intoxicating scent !

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I think it is really heavy. Definitely for colder days, and for night. On my skin its too woody, that's why I think it's not for me. Don't get me wrong, it is a good perfume, but rather for those who like strong scents. It last whole day, but most of that day you smell on wood. Euphoria Blossom is better to me, since it is lighter.",11/13/23 06:14,mekanazekana
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"On my skin euphoria is a jammy pomegranate scent with a solid woody base that backs it up and weirdly i get whiffs of Oud.
Am not mad at it tho , this is a seriously underestimated scent , it is not your typical girly designer perfume. I can see a mature sexy woman wearing this.

Sillage: 10/10
Longevity: a good 8 hours on my skin

Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I was waiting for the cool weather to wear this one. I bought the coffret with the big bottle, the smaller one and the body cream. Using the body cream and the perfume would made this guy a BAD ASS BEAST, because he already his beast mode, on longevity and sillage. I love the smell, is woody and sweet, with a ""boozyness"", or a smokiness that evokes a sensuality on your skin. Not very suitable for work but 100% on point for night outs and dates.

Funny thing is: while I was spraying today, it reminded me of a perfume I had from I Boticário: Glamour Exubérance, a flanker with a brown bottle of the Glamour family. I wore it in college (2014 ish) for the nights out and it's definitely a resemblance.",11/03/23 00:37,Tsmarcondes
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"I'm basing this review on a decant from Surrender To Chance. The vial didn't say, but I'm pretty sure I ordered the EDP.

I waited for cool weather where I live to test this. I like it! It's a strong fragrance; I can still smell it on my dry, perfume eating skin 12 hours after application. On me, it started out as floral and spicy, and over time, it's turned more woody. It reminds me of Obsession (not surprising as that's also a CK fragrance) and Angel, but it's not as spicy as those are on me. I really didn't get the fruity top notes; I have no idea why. I guess that's just my body chemistry.

To me, this is definitely a cool/cold weather fragrance. (However, that's my taste. Wear it in hot weather if you want!) And it would make a good ""date night"" fragrance. I do think it can be worn during the day if sprayed with restraint.

Do I recommend it? Yes, if you like strong, floral, spicy, woody scents. I'd say it's not a safe blind buy or a safe gift unless you're sure the recipient likes this type of fragrance.

With respect to office wear...Idk. I'd say, if you work with anyone you know has trouble with fragrance, don't wear this to work. And if you take mass transit, or sit close to anyone at work, I'd restrict this to 1 spray. And don't wear it on a plane! Please.

Will I buy a full bottle? Probably not, partly because we only have cold weather for about 5 months where I live. I might buy a travel spray or miniature size when I use up some other fragrances I have.",11/02/23 23:03,fragrancenovice
Euphoria Calvin Klein,"Just purchased this blind after looking at the notes as they were similar to another perfume I love (Dolce & Gabbana, The Only One) Initially Euphoria smelt slightly masculine but after 10 minutes it warms up and becomes more sensual and I really like it.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"somehow managed to completely forget that i own this despite the giant ugly bottle staring at me from my shelf for 2+ years; i never think to wear it. my grandparents bought it for me, probably because it's cheap and a bit edgy-looking (i am a lapsed scenemo kid), and i think the nostalgia factor of that association is making me extra fond of it. aggressively sweet berry and floral blast, and then it's mostly just a really pleasant wrist-to-nose sweetness on the skin. passion flower note makes me really happy bc they used to grow over the front of my house. smells really good on clothes actually! poor longevity and will only be smelled by others when hugging me, but i think i'll be wearing it as an inoffensive work scent or when i want to feel cosy around the house. it's not how i want to be perceived... but it might be how i perceive myself a little bit lol",08/21/25 11:41,mmanyhandss

However, within a few minutes, it fades away into almost nothing! When I first sprayed this, I thought I was going to like it best in the line, and if it weren’t for the longevity issue I probably would. The Mexican chocolate is such an interesting note but is barely detectable after a few minutes. I even doused my hand to see if this just needs a lot of sprays and it still faded away just a quickly! It’s unfortunate, it could be a great fragrance, but it wears even lighter than a body mist.",06/19/25 09:46,Ismellgood2024
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I wouldn’t recommend this. The scent is next to nothing. Zilch. Nada. Zip. You smell nothing the second you spray it from the bottle. You get the faintest hint of juicy and fruity sweetness, mixed with patchouli and warmth. But the longevity is so poor. Even when spraying a ton, like you would a body mist, the scent is nonexistent.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"The chocolate/patchouli/amber/vanilla notes in CK One Shock are reminiscent of Mugler's Angel, especially after it sits on the skin for 1+ hrs. With that in mind, its not a patchouli bomb at all. It's refreshing and bright with a cozy dry down. It's well blended and youthful but not overly sweet.

It doesn't last very long or project very far so I have to reapply throughout the day, which I don't mind since I got my bottle at Burlington for $20. I wear it t the office and on days when it's inappropriate to suffocate people with my Angel cloud",05/07/25 07:03,Bexting

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I don’t fully understand the need people have to bash a scent they dislike and then make others feel small for liking it. As if their own taste in perfume and preferences for scents is the end all be all through which everyone else is judged. If you don’t like something, that’s fine, but I don’t think there should be any reason to say that someone with “a real palate” would hate this, thereby implying that the people that do are uneducated Neanderthals.

I guess I’m one of those uneducated philistines with an underdeveloped palate for scent because I find nothing wrong with this.

Is it sweet? A bit, yes. Is it groundbreaking? No, not really. Are there other, better scents out there? Absolutely. Is there something wrong with this perfume because of any of the aforementioned things? Nope, there isn’t.

I get something akin to orange upon first spray, then that quickly fades into something sweet, somewhat chocolatey, and a bit earthy. It is a very soft, comforting scent. Sillage is not great, but I have more expensive perfumes that have terrible sillage so I’m not going to condemn it for that. I actually find it nice to wear when I’m at home and want to feel soft and comforted. I also like to wear it when people come over and I want to wear something that smells nice, but isn’t too “perfume-y.”

Is it the most gorgeously complex scent in the world? Is it going to do somersaults every five minutes on your wrist or perform an inspired soliloquy for you as it dries down? No. But sometimes perfumes can just be simple and comforting and nice.

And if you don’t find it nice, that’s ok too. Scent is a very personal thing, informed not just by individual chemistry but also by personal experience. So whenever you read someone’s super negative review or someone’s super positive review, take both with a grain of salt.",03/03/24 13:22,gabish

I have complex, great projecting fragrances for when I want that. Some days I just want to sip my iced coffee, enjoy being carefree, and be basic, and this is perfect for that.

CK One Shock is heavier than the other CK Ones', but it's still light enough to spray liberally in summer. I actually splash it on because the bottle has a twist off top.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"A nice, casual fresh/sweet fragrance, different due to the dark chocolate.
Opens with passionflower, tart berry and citrus, joined by vanilla, soft musk and lighter florals/discreet patchouli. The dark chocolate adds depth and a bitter touch.
The first hours 3-4 the berry, passionflower and chocolate are more pronounced, After that a pleasant, softer skin scent of soft musk, vanilla and florals remain.
Fortunately I don't get any ""Axe"" from this :).

An uplifting, inoffensive fragrance, great for intimate settings or work/leisure. I don't find it cheap, too sweet or juvenile. It's a bit joyous, flirty and sporty and could suit anyone young at heart, regardless age (gifted myself one💃🌸). Will enjoy this now when the long, cold winter is finally over.

Moderate sillage but strong longevity on me as a skin scent, I can still feel it after 8 hours. Lasts on clothes for a few days.",04/17/23 09:16,Blueberries
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I can't help it, I love this. Something about it is so unique to me. Yes - the sillage and longevity are poor. It lasts better than a body spray but not by much. But the scent of this is SO addictive to me. The chocolate and passion flower keep me constantly smelling my wrist.

I agree with others that it's a good bedtime scent. It's so cozy. It's not overly sweet. It's youthful and girly, but in a way I've not smelled before - it has an elegance I can't place.

It's tough to put in a category because it's... just not a pure floral, fruity or gourmand scent to me. It is its own thing!! Because it's not heavy or cloying I would wear this any season.

This was discovered by smelling it on a stranger, a ""what IS that?"" moment. At the low price you can get this for, in a HUGE 200ml bottle at that - I'm very happy.",03/10/23 14:56,whisperology

Some people like that.
I am not one of them.
The scent itself is fresh and sweet, but not sugary, or even cloying - it's a fresh sort of sweetness.
Sadly, the past half-hour, I've noticed something that reads as vaguely ""axe spray""-drydown, to me. Too bad - I liked it, aside from that.",02/27/23 09:06,HellsBelle
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"My poor working nose detects a sweet, fruity, pink flowery, creamy chocolaty and powdery scent.

At first I had the ck one SHOCK for her in the shock absorber travel spray vaporisateur nomade with 20 ml of this lovely juice. At that time I found the white rectangular plastic vaporizer with hot pink soft rubbery case and hot pink SHOCK on the front very modern and practical.
Now our phones are mostly rectangular with a protective rubbery case. The design was truly an inspiration.

Today I have bought the 200 ml bottle. A bit disappointed with its normalcy.

I like this scent because it starts fresh but not sour. I was surprised there is no citrus in this scent or green notes. So this freshness must be the alcohol with Red Poppy and Narcissus?
I smell sweet pink flowers; perhaps Passion Flower, Jasmine and Peony? I think sweet fruitiness is from a jammy Blackberry. And powder is from the Mexican chocolate and Musk. I have never had Mexican chocolate, so I have no idea.
There is Vanille and Patchouli for sure, and the Amber adds that nice deep warmth to it. And a bit of spice, maybe? There is a development but it’s all close together.

I really like this! I think oriental isn’t a bad description for this eau de toilette. It isn’t light, it’s sweet, fruity and warm. I hope that, with age, my new bottle losses the alcoholic start a bit and becomes even smoother. Happy with my purchase.",02/22/23 11:56,yadzee

If you are like me and interested in this scent because of the chocolate or vanilla note, skip it! It really is just the faintest fresh laundry scent. Big disappointment unfortunately!",01/19/23 20:00,Grremily00
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,On me this smells like a really sweet play dough. I like it but I don't wear it so much because I have so many fragrances. I'm still happy I have it though and u love the bottle and sprayer.,12/30/22 21:18,Tlm93
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"At first this smells so much like Ariana Moonlight to me, but slightly less sharp and a whisper of chocolate. I like it, I think it's pretty, but I'll probably sell because the longevity is as poor as everyone says. And I was hoping for more gourmandy goodness; I don't get any vanilla with this and I can *barely* detect chocolate if I look for it.

Got a 100ml bottle at Ross for $20 so I can't be mad.",12/29/22 13:19,boolprop

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"In 2018 while on a holiday in greece my mom decided to buy a calvin klein body wash because both of us remember events by the scents. It turns out that the trip to greece now means a lot to me because i got into reading then and it changed my life. This scent reminds me of summer in a foreign country and my favorite book, what was it like to read for the first time.",12/10/22 15:12,AdelleA
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"Blind bought this in a set that came with the male version that i plan to give my brother for christmas, why not get a gift while giving a gift!

This fragrance is such a pleasant unique surprise, i wasn’t expecting it. Theres also this familiarity to it, like I’ve definitely smelt this on people in the past; im almost certain one of my teachers wore this.

Im a big fan of passion flower, which is what prompted this purchase so much, but its not really at the forefront at all, more hanging out in the background. I feel like i should have tried this years ago, i would have been wearing religiously. Its clean and fresh but still flirtatious, sometimes its very reminiscent of Ari by Ariana Grande.

Only issue i found, which has been stated quite a few times here, is the longevity is relatively poor and it overall sits pretty close to the skin. Within 2 hours the fragrance is for the most part evaporated, but i like that for fragrances i use after a shower.

Id give this a solid 8/10 and totally recommend giving it a try, especially when 6.7oz bottles can be had on ebay for under $30. At the very least sample it, you may find a new favorite daily like I did!",12/07/22 16:56,Mattesha Erotica
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"funny story on my first encounter with this scent; back in high school the girl who owned this sat behind me and she broke her bottle in the middle of class and it didn't take long for the whole classroom to smell of this fragrance. its fresh floral, citrusy, musky with a hint of spiciness. i love the patchouli in this. although i don't really smell the chocolate... maybe its just me. this reminds me of preppy high school girls",11/01/22 01:35,sailorneptune

It’s very confusing…I’m wanting to use it up so it’s a out-of-the-shower, wake-me-up fragrance at this time, what’s really crazy is it’s super fresh and citrus notes don’t typically last. It’s a real 🤔 to me!",10/13/22 09:51,xXx CHAR xXx
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,My stepmom gave me her bottle when I was about 20-21 and I loved it!! It smells so sweet and playful and young. Kind of sporty too. I wore this everyday while I was in cosmetology school and it reminds me of that time in my life. It’s very nostalgic for me. I haven’t worn this in years but I sniff it from time to time and it still has a special place in my heart ❤️,10/01/22 09:54,mocam
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,On my skin this smells identical to playdough 🤣 I was checking these reviews to see if I'm the only one and apparently I am. I'm surprised how weak this is I over spray and this didn't even last 30 mins I think that's the shocking part lol. I usually don't care about the longevity because I'm gonna over spray any way but this is bad after one hour I can't even smell it at all.,09/05/22 05:09,Tlm93
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"My signature scent like 7-8 years ago. Very girly and sweet. Not my cup of tea anymore as I really steer away from anything sweet with patchouli.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I made a mistake of buying 200 ml bottle few years ago and now i m trying to finish it up, I got sick of it. Now i start to spray it on clothes only just to finish it quick. I like it back then, the first few hours has a good sillage and good projection on me, after stays close to the skin.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I usually don’t listen to comments or reviews so when they said this has weak staying power I still bought a bottle because who knows it might actually last long on my skin. But lo and behold, the longevity is so poor that some of my BBW/Victoria Secret mists lasts even longer than this. Sometimes not even 30 mins and I could hardly smell it. Ugh!

The thing is I super love how this smells like so I still consider this a win blind buy. I’ll just have to keep reapplying since it’s totally inexpensive. How i wish they make an intense version of this. To my nose it smells like a chocolatey-berry sweet that is so pleasant. The smell makes up for the lack of power but I really really wish it lasts longer…oh well!",05/07/22 09:37,Pebblesjebbles333
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I'm so disappointed by this scent. I've tested it a few times in the past but recently bought a bottle on a whim and while it was pretty cheap (and so I don't mind liberally spraying it) it is just really underwhelming. Generic sweet with no real discernible notes. I can sometimes get a hint of the mexican chocolate but barely and at a certain point it smells a bit like a weak air freshener. Barely lasts fifteen minutes and only if I touch my nose to my skin.

Despite all that criticism I will inevitably use the whole bottle pretty fast because it isn't unpleasant and works as a ""may as well use it up"" kinda scent as long as you don't expect to smell of anything within half an hour.",05/07/22 08:58,fr3ckles

Now I like it (not very much but enough to sometimes spice my day a little bit). It's still sweet in a very strange way but now I can smell other notes I didn't smell before.
It's very intimate but very long lasting. I can smell it after 10+ hours (less but it is still there).

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"Ah another perfume of wasted potential. Passion flower is one of the best florals to pair with gourmand Vanilla. The balance is great. It's not too sweet, not too musky, not too fruity. It's not just a one-dimension kind of fragrance. It has its own phases and depth without being too heavy. I can see teens and adults wearing this in any occasion with ease. Gyms? Sure. Work? Great. Party? Why not. I guess they made this to fit any kind of season and occasion. A mass market item. Sadly, this is rather weak and comparable to body sprays. It's cheap though! Safe for blind buy and gifts.",09/17/21 23:47,Calinare
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"The fragrance I wore before I really got into fragrance.
Generic, inoffensive fruity floral. More fruity than floral, really. Doesn't last long at all - probably best used as a body spray rather than a perfume.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"Yes, this perfume does fade fast but I still get a few hours of goodess from this beauty! I get the mostly vague oriental fruits from this, in the best way, it is a burst of fun and nothing serious at all (obvious from the bottle) but I do see this as unique. I enjoy spritzing this when I want something easy and fun that isn't going to stick around all day.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"The few first times I wear this, I didn't like it very much, it was ""meh"" and the sillage and the longevity was also very weak, also all I smelled was alcohol. All of those made it sit on the shelf for quite a long time, maybe 5-6 months. Until today, I decided to give it a try again. I must say first, I have and I have used a lot, I mean a lot fragrances including desginer's and niche, yet this time, I kinda love this one. This time, it didn't smell like alcohol at all (maybe because I give the bottle a little shake before use, a tip I've learned recently). You can definitely get the strawberry note (which I don't see in the note description), very very lovely, sweet but not too sweet, cute and young, a little bit something like powdery which I really enjoy. I don't see any floral notes personally. The sillage as well as the longevity this time was a hit for CK line. You can know that I'm in the room for about 30-60m, but after that it lingers and a few hours later, you have to sniff your wrist in order to notice it, which was quite good for a CK. The price is very cheap so can't complain. I must say I really enjoy it this time. I recommend you guys give this one a shot.",07/05/21 10:27,BoToi
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"This has been one of my favourite perfumes for years, I wouldn't say that I have a signature scent, but this is probably the closest I have to a signature. Having said that I understand that people find this a generic fruity-sweet scent, but on me it is quite special. It may also be my happy memories of this and a certain amount of nostalgia (I have loved this for almost 10 years and worn it continuously for over 9), but it really does work on me. I also get moderate sillage with this (I find it fair for an EDT) and moderate longevity on skin and excellent longevity on clothing. My skin is usually a fragrance leech and I find even big perfumes have average to poor longevity on me, which is why I find it strange that this lasts relatively well on me compared to most people.
For me this starts with the blackberry and passion flower and quickly segues into the chocolate with the vanilla and musk bringing up the powdery base. Like the other Calvin Klein scent I know and love, it is well balanced and blended.
I remember eagerly racing around duty free for the very first time in late 2011, excited to be in the international part of the airport and travelling and sniffing endless bottles of perfume, low, middle and high end. By the end of the trip I had fallen in love with 3 fragrances, CK One Shock Her (the advertising around this was ubiquitous at the time), Prada Candy (same, the advertising was everywhere) and CK In2U. In early 2012, I had a bit of remaining spending money in hand, it was not enough to get Prada Candy but was enough for CK One Shock or CK In2U and I had to decide. At the time this was at the tail end of my fruity-citrus phase and the citrusy but unique In2U was the natural choice, however the sweetness of One Shock Her drew me in and I walked out with this in my suitcase. This was the first of many bottles of CK One Shock Her and the beginning of my love of gourmand fragrances and I still love it today.",06/27/21 08:00,FollowTheRedHat

I used only this perfume for 2-3 years and i loved it. Reading the comments before mine, i started to think that something must have changed. Perfumes on me don’t last, but with Ck One shock, though it’s an EDT, i never thought it did’t last enough.

Reallyyyy like this, super impressed",06/12/20 15:19,KennedyH
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I really enjoy the contrast of fresh, tart, almost green fruity floral notes and sweet, creamy vanilla and chocolate in this. The passion flower stands out and gives the juicy blackberry and airy peony an extra kick. The chocolate is on the milky and light side, it reminds me of a chocolate and vanilla milkshake. In the drydown the whole composition also makes me think of chocolates with berry filling. The fragrance has a slightly synthetic and oily vibe, but I like it, it keeps CK One Shock from being boring.

I don't understand all the complaints about longevity, I can smell this on me all day which is not especially noteworthy for my perfume-friendly skin, but obviously not bad. It's just not the most intense fragrance on earth, so a couple more sprays won't hurt. A happy and comforting scent, especially nice for warmer days, but I also love to wear it right now in cool spring weather.",05/08/20 16:08,SailorV

i might not buy this for myself because i have now associated this with my mother but i would say this is one of my favorites of hers (and fav one to borrow!)

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I tested this one again to give it another chance. Here are my thoughts:

This is a fruity-musky-vanilla. It is pleasant but nothing groundbreaking to me. I found it enjoyable to wear, but I kept wishing it was a bit louder. Maybe it's my fault for wearing too much perfume all the time, but when it comes to quiet scents like this, I find it hard to appreciate them.. I wish they would speak up!

On me, this is a skin-scent from beginning to end. Even upon first spritz, it was hard to make out the notes, for me. I got a fruity vibe, although didnt really feel like blackberry to me. Just tuttifrutti. And I got vanilla and sweetness. I could smell musk. And that was it.

Do I hate it? No. It's an allright, for me.",10/14/19 11:13,JustSimpleThings
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"This is def an elegant gourmand perfume, nothing fresh and aqcuatic like the original ck one. Having said that, it's boring and generic high end headachy perfume.

I blind bought a 6.8 ounce bottle of this for like 12 bucks, so basically 2 cups of coffee lmao. it was pleasant, so I used it as a room spray until half was gone. I dumped the other half as I couldn't bother having my room smell like CK ONE shock any longer. bleh.",06/16/19 21:26,burberryboy
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I’m so happy I’ve found this! I’ve been on the hunt for a new signature scent and probably tried dozens of scents recently but haven’t found The One. This might be it.

It starts off fruity and fresh, a bit citrusy tart then turns into juicy wildberries and mellows out to a light vanilla whipped cream with a hint of milk chocolate in the dry down. Not synthetic at all. It’s beautifully soft, lightly sweet but that’s perfect for me as I’ve found most vanilla/gourmand scents to be too sickly sugary or powdery and others to be too floral/perfumey and I don’t like anything woody.

I agree with the other reviews that the longevity isn’t great (~2hours) and doesn’t have great sillage - sticks pretty close to the skin but it’s pretty cheap for a big bottle so happy to spritz more of it throughout the day. A perfect mix of light, fresh, summery and sweet and comforting.

Testing this in winter.

I also love YSL Mon Paris and Chloé Nomade but they are so expensive!

***UPDATE: Bought a 200mL bottle for USD$30. Actually lasts all day if you spray on clothes, weak sillage though (2 inches).

***FURTHER UPDATE: The more I wear it the more I like it. It’s just right for me, a fresh and fruity, a little floral, soft edible milky chocolate and vanilla on the dry down. I don't get any patchouli at all (which is great as I'm not a fan). Fresh fun and also comforting. I’ve tried over 40 fragrances in the last couple of months and I keep coming back to this. I do have to reapply often but I’m ok with that, only wish it had a bit better sillage.",06/16/19 20:07,NessS
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"The reviews are so positive, it seems to be a gourmand indeed, a berry, vanilla chocolate fragrance that is sure to please apparently.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"This the mom version of Fantasy by Britney Spears. Sweet scent. That will appeal more to younger crowd and younger moms but is also nice on all ages. Mass appeal would be for those who like a sweet but light scent for the daytime.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"It's fruity yet not too feminine, it's warm and sweet, but at the same time, it's wearable and office friendly. The only issue I have with this fragrance is longevity. However, since it costs less than average CK perfume.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I wanted to love this, and it smells light, fruity, sweet, and lovely when I spray it. BUT it lasts 5-10 minutes. I am not kidding. What is going on? I got a 200 ml bottle too, trusting it to be nice since I usually love the CK line. I have put it in the bedroom to use as room freshener. Sad face.",10/13/18 01:53,ghostgirl1
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"The bottle:
Simple & boring.

Inside the bottle:
Sweet & light are the words to describe this perfume.When sprayed you get a blast of blackberries & Mexican chocolate that gives the perfume a bit of a power scent because of it and vanilla. When dried you get hints of florals but very faint.Longevity is okay more on the poor side and will be light in the skin.

Overall:
This perfume is great for someone who loves sweet scent and who are sensitive to perfume. Too bad this one might only last a couple hours. It's a very pretty scent.",10/02/18 11:46,simplegeek
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"On me, Starts off true to the votes with a vanilla and adding a little blackberry. Then makes a small change of floraly fresh and vanilla. Can't smell a big patchouli note but very subtly there near the dry down.

I'm not a huge fan of it but it is nice and I could see myself wearing it when I don't need longevity (which seems to be 2-3 hours on me) to the beach or pool maybe? As it is inexpensive ($30 for 200ml in Australia) you can smell good and not worry about it possible washing off.",09/21/18 20:48,Minted
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"Shock is a light and sweet, easy to wear daytime scent. I really have been enjoying it in warm weather when I want sweetness but nothing sickening or heavy. It has an unexpected fresh and tart vibe to it, from the blackberry and passionflower. It allllmost gets a little sour for me but never quite goes there. I think Shock is easily likeable, but I can see why some people feel it's boring. But for me, this combination of notes I find quirky and unique. Longevity is not so great though; I usually end up refreshing it after 2 hours.",09/08/18 19:49,Centsless
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I really liked Shock.. at first. It's super sweet and fruity with a hint of spiciness when I first apply it. However, after a few minutes the fragrance betrays me and turns into something dirty and sour. Perhaps it's the jasmine and patchouli notes. Or the chemistry of my skin. Either way, I cannot wear this, the drydown makes me wanna gag a little bit.",08/25/18 21:30,N8vDoll

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"How in the world did this get labeled as a spicy oriental? This is certainly a fruity floral gourmand. I blind bought last night at Marshall’s. I don’t dislike it, but I wasn’t prepared for it to be so sweet! I think I can pull this off in the Summer. I may try layering it with White Diamonds Luster to temper the sweetness. It has a strong sweetness, berry and almost a milk creaminess to it. Sillage is close to the skin, more like a body spray. I was expecting more spice from the floral. But I really enjoy going to Marshall’s and taking a chance on a blind buy. So sometimes you end up with something unexpected. I’d suggest testing this out unless you like sweet fruity fragrances and are not expecting much longevity or sillage.",04/14/18 10:35,Mrs. ELE Arjona
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"It's the second time I rebuy Shock!
A perfect choice for spring and summertime. A typical daytime perfume, but you have to use it more during the day, cause it's soft, and it will not stay on your skin for the whole day.I like that it's sweet but still fresh, and the fact that it has a very good price too, makes it worth to buy, even if I use it a lot.",04/08/18 06:50,kvikii
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"The only reason that keeps me away from buying this are the first 30 min which are meh... and kind of sour.

Anyway, i’m still on the fence with this one...",02/25/18 01:52,yloenog
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,I kind of tired of the CK One range in the 90's to be honest as everyone wore it back then. I do appreciate that this is a completely different fragrance though and after hearing a few rave reviews that it is better than it seems I purchased a bottle blindly. It is a nice floral fruity with mild staying power. I agree that it is better than you would expect based on looking at the bottle but it is not a favorite or anything like that. It is quite tropical and fun. I don't quite get why this is in the CK one line as it has nothing in common with CK one. I think it really needed its own name and a different design bottle. The bottle design is annoying - you remove the cap that seals the fragrance and insert the sprayer nozzle meaning that unless you switch over to the cap if it is pressed it will spray and prone to leaking. A bit unnecessary and impracticle especially for travelling. Besides that it is a decent bargain buy.,01/29/18 18:15,Contessa01
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I dont hate it, its still wearable, but its too light even for summer. I also get some weird -almost medicinal- smell when I first spray it which kind of reminds me of the perfumes you find in drugstores, thankfully it fades away.",01/18/18 21:04,Fa

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I really like this one!
It was a blind purchase for me, so I was worried it would smell very unisex like a lot of the other CK scents. But not at all! It´s definitely a feminine fragrance although if you´re a man and want to wear this.. do it! =)

It´s Fresh, slightly sweet, slightly floral and after a while on the skin it warms up and I can detect some of the chocolate and vanilla.

It´s mainly a fresh fragrance though, very suitable for daytime use. Work/school whatever. =)

I truly enjoy this one, bought 50ml, next time I´m getting the huge 200ml bottle! =D

Sillage and Longevity are quite weak though.. It lasts on my skin for about 2-3 hours and the sillage ain´t heavy what so ever. It´s soft but you definitly notice it and I feel like it leaves and slight trail of scent after me. =)

SO WORTH it for me. Perfect Spring/Summer/Fall scent. It´s fall now and I think it works perfectly because it´s fresch and nice to use for those crisp fall days! =)

The CK DNA is there but shock added the right ingredients to make this a fragrance for women. I can smell berries and just the right amount of sweetness that the berries and the vanilla and cocoa aren't battling each other for domination. Only complaint is that it's longevity and sillage aren't that great, but when I was looking at the prices for it i can't complain. I can spray spray spray away as liberally as I want.",09/22/17 15:22,comfortablynumb83

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"Oriental spicy??? What? No, no, no this is a gourmand fruity scent. VW Princess is wayyyy more floral than this one. This is soft and sweet, kinda V&R Flowerbomb or Body Shop Black Musk kinda sweet but with waaay less }POW{. My fave so far with Chocolate are Angel and Rhianna Rebel (love those two!). But this is nice. Not sure I will keep it though just because it's kinda like some others I have ( for some reason- probs the blackberry/currant vibe, this reminds me of Jimmy Choo Exotic). Def a close/skin scent which makes this safe for work and play but not a night out kinda scent (to me). I get basically all blackberry with some vanilla and then it dries down to just being a soft and sweet scent... Body shop made a Smoky Poppy which has the poppy but I don't think they smell similar. Overall a OK scent. But I think I will be returning this anyway as I have others similar and don't need to spend the money on this but I am def on the ""fence"" about returning and keeping it lol ;)",02/25/17 12:27,*_Lilly_*
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"Beautiful soft comforting sweet scent on a bed of vanilla laced with rich luxurious chocolate undertones. I really love this scent in winter, it is cosy does not project much and is definitely a skin scent. I hardly ever reach for it throughout the year, but in winter when I am at home or running errands I often reach for this as I find it warming and comforting. It is sweet, but not sharp or synthetically sweet- it smells naturally sweet thanks to an overdose of sugar vanilla and luscious chocolate. It also smells some what milky and musky to me which I really like- I do detect a creamy vanilla muskiness on dry down. This makes for a very safe gift, some may find it boring, but offensive it could never be. It does actually last quite a while on skin, but even longer on clothes. On clothes it smells like a luxurious clothes conditioner. This scent is cosy and comforting it is a soft sweet scent done well in my opinion. The name shock is very misleading- as the shock appeal is something it is not. It is safe soft weak but comforting nevertheless, perfect for casual winter days when you want to feel cosy, comfy and snug.",12/21/16 09:51,polkadot27

It's the kind of scent that reminds me of exotic drinks, sun lotion and warm breeze but not salty water, melon or anything like these. I have cacao note in most perfumes but here it is perfectly balanced with fruity and other notes, not irritating or nauseating. A work of art for me, and surprise surprise - it's Calvin Klein!

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I don't think I've hated the top notes of any fragrance more. It's so citric and sharp. I'm adding passion fruit flower to my list of most hated notes along side red and black currant, vetiver and cedar. However, I can handle even my most hated notes in a fragrance, if they are submissive to notes I love or don't last long. This fragrance the passion fruit flower is gone almost as quickly as it comes, thank goodness! The top is a nose itching, eye watery blast of citric acid. Then that burns off with record quickness. In its place emerges a candy sweet combination of what smells like strawberry milk and a dash of cocoa powder. It's not a heavy fragrance though. Far from being heavy, it's light and watery. Strawberry milk scented sugar water with a hint of powdered chocolate and florals. It's so light I think you could pour the bottle on yourself and not offend anyone around you. It's a summer gourmand as odd as that sounds. I think it's pretty, comforting and easy to wear in the drydown. It's not ground breaking or swoon worthy, but it's a nice change from sticky sweet, heavy scents so popular these days. It's not often I find myself describing a scent as both sweet, gourmand AND light and watery.",07/21/16 00:11,blake.lee
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"Wow, this is seriously yummy (first few hours especially). Strawberry Milkshake is what I got right off the bat. Thick, creamy, jammy and sweet. Gets more 'jammy' overtime and less milky/creamy though. Like a jam of ripe and juicy forest berries. Hours later, I still get berry jam but with the bitterness of patchoulli developing (not too keen on this), it gets darker. I didn't really get the cocoa...maybe a little in the drydown, but I had trouble detecting it. It's on the light and casual side as far as gourmands are concerned, not a heavy-duty one (like LVEB for instance). A good thing in this case, as it would be very nauseating if it were louder. This scent could work all year round, great for casual fall/winter wear and won't be too much for the breezier summer days/nights. Very good longevity (7 hours +, and I still get faint whiffs 10 hours later) and moderate sillage.",06/21/16 16:19,hyperfluff

What I don't like is how weak it is. It sits extremely close to the skin meaning even a second after spraying I can only detect its scent if I bring a wrist up to my nose and sniff. It gradually seems to get weaker to until, after an hour at the most, it's completely gone.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I bought this perfume because out of the bottle it smelled like something I used to have as a child and I felt nostalgic. Also, the bottle looks really cool and I generally like CK fragrances. I did not regret buying it because it's a very delicate and happy summer fragrance, but I wish it had better lasting power. My skin usually kills all perfume pretty quickly and that's why I mostly wear heavy vanilla and oriental scents. But sometimes I wish I was able to wear something this light without it disappearing completely in 20 minutes! It's still a nice addition to my collection.
The first spray was very refreshing and citrusy on me and I'm surprised there are no citrus notes listed. After a few seconds, it's a full on berry burst which is lovely! I mostly get blackberry, vanilla and chocolate but there's some additional milky creaminess and I'm not sure where it comes from. I can also distinguish the amber and the musk, but the florals don't come forward to me at all. Maybe I detect a hint of jasmine, but other than that it's all sugar, vanilla and berries.
I can picture myself wearing this on a summer afternoon or in early spring - it's really a perfect scent for warm weather. The longevity and the sillage are my only problems with CK One Shock. After 20-30 minutes I can only detect it if I put my nose directly against my wrist. It's a shame because this could be one of my favorite summer perfumes!",02/24/16 05:56,narcozia
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"For girls who want to settle with a beautiful ""beef,"" CK One Shok the female version is an excellent choice, despite being super ""more of the same"" he pleases and ensures a median perfuming quite engaging. It's a pretty girl scent gourd, high nymphet the nth degree, I can not imagine him in more mature women, not that they do not can use it, but is more the shape of young women ""innocent"" of this life! Its opening is a soft floral reminding Natura Chronos skin products because of Passiflora flower (passion flower) that has a hint middle citric velvety too delicious, reminiscent of the fruit itself, however, can be more exotic and acceptable. Then he becomes a well beaten fruity, added to hot melted chocolate in a double boiler over some jasmine notes sweetened by Amora also silky, giving the impression of a simple scent but well redondinho. Its base is its best phase in my view, first, because it casts quite coming and going pleasing to the wearer without harming those who are nearby, second, by becoming an amber oriental heated super cozy and behaved, and third, for further remind the girl stereotype gourd and high nymphet to the nth degree with more precision and intensity. In short, it is a fragrance that can hardly fail to please, is not as sweet, is not so serious, is not so powerful and so only perfumão, a scent medium to joy of the young ladies!

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I love this fragrance. It's really packs a punch, is sweet yet floral. It last a fairly long time too if you spray it on clothing rather than your skin. The only thing is the dispenser. You unscrew the metal cap and the stick on a cheap-feeling, plastic disperser. The metal lid does not go back on top so it doesn't look the prettiest on your shelf. It's a nice perfume and I got it on special offer, I think if I found it going cheap I would get it again but I'm a bit of a bottle collector so don't think I would get it when the bottle is so plain and the top is so nasty.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,":):)A very very mellow and comforting vanilla scent. I love how low-key and easy to wear this is.

I found the removable nozzle of the CK one series very interesting. When I first smelled this from the bottle, I got a hint of citrusy berries, a gush of alcohol and some vanilla. It was very light like coconut water almost. On my skin, the citrusy alcohol smell faded in 5 minutes and left with only vanilla. It smelled very soothing. As time passed, the vanilla scent became stronger, and within a hour it turned into a buttery chocolate. It was very yummy but still very light and comforting like the smell from the downstairs kitchen when you mom was baking cookies.

I sprayed this on at night after shower. The chocolatey scent lasted on my arms for a long time. I could still smell it after the next morning. That was nearly 10 hours! But I suppose it wouldn't last this long if you were out going about your day. But I wouldn't mind constantly reapplying this since this scent is such a yummy treat. And it's so comforting that it won't offend anyone.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I honestly cannot figure out why they named this CK One “Shock” because the only thing shocking about this fragrance is the utter lack of silage and longevity. And this is coming from a life-long, card carrying member of the Undersprayers Club who rarely sprays more than 3 sprays of any fragrance, even the ones others describe as weak or low-silage.

Despite this, I do like the fragrance. On me it’s berries and vanilla with subtle undertones of mixed flowers—sweet and summery without being syrupy or cloying. I’ve read that it was designed as a summer fragrance and I believe it—I can’t imagine over-applying this, even on the hottest of days. I applied about 6-7 sprays of this on a recent hot day and could barely smell it after 90 minutes! I don’t regret buying this, but only because I got a fabulous deal on a 100ml bottle that was on clearance at a local department store.

I love the fruity opening, and I love when it dries down to coco. I read online that Calvin Klein made this for summer use, which makes sense.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I'm not too sure about this one. I've owned it for a while and I wear it sometimes, but it's not my favourite. To me it's very generic - there's nothing special or unique about it. I feel neutral towards this one.

I own a small bottle of it and it's usually in my bag if I need to re-apply my perfume during the day, but it's never my first choice in the morning. In other words it's there in case of emergencies. By the way, the bottle is AWFUL! Calvin Klein seriously need to get some new designers on the scene.

Haven't quite made up my mind about this one.",04/18/15 20:50,sapphire14
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"To me, this smells exactly like The Body Shop's Raspberry body butter. I love that body butter, however I have mostly moved on from fruity gourmands.

It's executed well for a fruity gourmand. Especially compared to Yves Rocher Framboise (which smells more like raspberry lollipop), this has much more class.

Oh and, say what you will, but that bottle is ugly. Put this in a cutesy bottle and THEN I might consider.",04/10/15 02:39,morfelisia
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I am a man but i tend to have experience with it.
This is the perfume i bought to my girlfriend and she likes it.
I found it on an Airport Duty Free Shop and sprayed it on a test sheet and tested how it was.
At first, though it is not on the note pyramid, but i got the sweet aroma of strawberry, then it dried down to an intoxicating mix with vanilla, it was a really sweet smell.
Then after a few minutes i got the smell of chocolate, now no strawberry at all but chocolate not too heavy but a little bit of chocolatish smell, but i got the vanilla all the time.
Definitely a buy if u r into vanilla type of scents
and it has a good projection (not a beast)
and longevity mayb as far as i remember it lasted 5-6 hours give or take on my girlfriend. She loves the perfume tbh.
TO conclude, great scent at a low rate.
So here goes my rating -
Scent - 8/10
Projection - 5/10
Longevity - 5/10
overall - 7/10",02/18/15 03:42,Khurshed6338
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"Overall, a decent scent but not for me. The bottle comes with a removable cap so I actually stuck some skewers into mine and turned into a reed diffuser xD
Th scent is not bad, but not something I would grab for. I can see how some others might like it, as it's not really offensive or strong or sharp.

The perfume reminds me of more of a gourmand than an oriental, and I get no floral from it. It reminds me a lot of Vera Wang Princess, with it's cocoa notes almost making the scent milky.

Smells like maybe you were just baking cookies, or in a chocolate shop, with a slight freshness underneath and some slightly detectable perfumatice notes like amber and musk, which stop the scent from being too sugary or sweet and round it out a bit.

Anyways, I am more of a fan of 'shampoo' scents so this was not up my alley, but it is not bad, and if you like chocolatey scents or you like 'Escada Magnetism' or 'Vera Wang Princess' than I would recommend it.",02/09/15 12:39,MsGoody2Shoes

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"For some reason, I dig cacao scent lately, and CK One Shock for her provides me with 200ml of it.

This fragrance is playful.
I love the playful-flirty scent of Paco Rabanne's Black XS for Her, but I somehow consider it to be waaay too strong for day-use. CK One Shock for Her is the answer for light cocoa to be worn during the day.

However, due to its playful nature.. If you are a person who works professionally in the office and looking for perfume to be worn for work, this might not be your best choice.

Opening is hell of a fruitish spray, but the middle notes are just awesome. Sweet flirty chocolate that lingers for couple hours before fading into beautiful powdery musky vanilla.

Sadly, this fragrance is only for the user to enjoy.
Sillage is close to none, although stays for quite considerable length of time.",12/25/14 07:29,imochy

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"Well I will have to agree that it is not a perfume that it is noticeable or you will remember forever. It starts fruity and it becomes powedery-creamy. Its sillage is almost unnoticeable even to me. Unless I put half of the bottle, it will evaporate in 2h maximum. The sillage is very close to the skin. It is a nice smell indeed, but not something unforgetable or special. No wonder it is on offer these days. But, if you find it for a good price then why not? I don't find it offensive, but not something special and seriously I wonder how this can be regarded as oriental spicy...",09/17/14 05:07,Bublegum

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"sweet, tart and yummy. Not as good as Calypso St. Barth 'Lily' ...but it smells like someone wanted to make a copy of it and added vanilla to disguise its similarity. still very nice, might be a good winter alternative to my beloved 'summery' Lily. :)",09/05/14 09:03,coco76
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I'm assuming the slightly tart floral I smell at the beginning is the passion flower, but I'm not familiar enough with the flower to say. Whatever it is, it's a pretty unique note and a nice surprise to see pop up in the fruity floral market. I only get the merest hints of what I think might be dark chocolate.

It doesn't have much sillage as a light EDT, but it has a sightly different attitude than your typical ""pink"" fragrance. There's the popular berries and vanilla combo, yes. But it also has a spicy, tangy kick to it. Nothing punk rock, mind you.

This is a case of the bottle not doing the scent justice. CK One Shock isn't shocking or juvenile and the same goes for her twin brother. Also, it bears no resemblance to CK One. None. I really think Calvin Klein missed an opportunity by not releasing this set as something different altogether and, consequently, they've gone largely ignored. The only shock is what an injustice that is.

Basically, it smells good. At that price, it won't hurt you to try it.",09/04/14 17:03,HanamiTsukimi

It is, to me, a playful and summery scent, and it is nothing at all like CK One. However, the scent does not linger on my skin for very long-- I get around 3 hours out of it, then I can't even tell I had it on, which I find disappointing since all of my other CK fragrance have amazing lasting power.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I wanted to spray something on my wrist in the shop, and this just happened to be on sale so it caught my eye.

I like CK fragrances in general, and recently tested several of their fragrances for men - it made me nostalgic about the 90s!

I loved CK One Shock (for women) within a minute of spraying it on my skin - what a pleasant surprise!

It's not your typical fresh CK fragrance - it's obviously not meant to be as the notes are something totally different.

I detected the cacao and vanilla in it. I couldn't identify the other exact notes in it, but I loved it in general.

Sweet, without being too sweet. Comforting, without being overpowering. Young, without being too young.

I live in a hot climate and it's a very hot summer day today - this fragrance worked in this weather, but I could imagine it in the autumn and winter too. (Simply because there's something so comforting about it - perhaps the chocolate and vanilla?)

The only minus for me is the dry down. It's just not that pleasant. And it came a little too quickly, maybe after about 2 hours or so.",07/03/14 14:31,Yosa
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"At first when I sprayed it, it smelled like an alcoholic drink.
Then suddenly it turned very sweet.
I think it smells a little like hair conditioner.
I can sense fruity notes and sweetness from vanilla and chocolate.
Actually, there's nothing shocking about it, it's just another sweet fruity scent.
I'm also afraid that sillage and longevity might be quite bad.
Not bad, but a little unoriginal.",07/02/14 12:20,ScarlettX
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,Only thing shocking about this is the sillage. Doesn't last long at all. Yes its sweet but in a yoghurt & synthetic way.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"Kinda reminds me of Katy Perry's meow but the coco makes a big difference. Soft and sweet
Found this at tjmaxx for 19.99 for a 3.4 ounce. Not bad at all. I will say the only con to this is the lasting power. It last about 3hours on my skin. Which is okay when your use to 6 to 7 hours.
But the smell is just yummy I don't mind re-applying it!

Did anyone noticed it has most of the same notes as Princess by Vera Wang??",06/13/14 09:36,caylarhene
CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"Forgot my perfume so I asked my friend if i can have a few spritz of hers. She handed me this.

I immediately took a sniff on the cap and I was ""shock""! I did not expect that CK will have a scent like this because it's way different from CK One, but I love it!!! It was like love at first sight!

The vanilla here was different, more like cream. The sweetness was liven up by the raspberry.

The thing that comes into my mind when sniffing (yes, you read that right. lol) this were strawberries and cream, but it does not smell generic. This one is more sophisticated. The vanilla and sweetness is not irritating and the raspberry just goes so well as it balances the sweetness.

To those who hate scents that goes with ""sweet and yummy"", you ought to try this one. This might just change your mind!",06/06/14 07:21,Thesesimplejoys

Let me give you a sense of relief by saying that you won't be reading stuff like : 'it's sweet but not sickly sweet.' Or 'it's sweet but not cloying.'

You know that moment when you see a really cute scene like a baby, or a father figure kissing that baby's nose , or an elderly man caressing his elderly wife with his shaky old hands..... It's an ' awe' moment, right?

That's ck one shock!
It's an 'Awe perfume'. Can't really offend anyone. Very innocent. Very yoghurty. And yoghurt was never too sweet.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I typically steer clear of incredibly sweet fragrances, but this isn't your average teenage girl blast of sugar nausea, it is a much more sophisticated and classy sweet fragrance for confident young women. The opening scent is a sharp sweetness which is perhaps what earns it the name 'shock'. After around an hour of wear it dies down into a lovely creamy vanilla floral, nothing spectacular but a lovely comforting feminine fragrance for every day wear. I don't detect any cocoa or berries unless I spray a lot of it, but the sweet vanilla stands out all the way through with the odd waft of floral. I also think the bottle reflects the scent well, understated for the most part but with a clear stand out element. I don't think this will ever become a classic or a favourite, but overall it's a nice fragrance.",03/10/14 08:13,Quarantine

When I first tried this on randomly while out shopping one day I loved it! I had to get me a bottle right away.
Since owning it I have had a headache & felt very ill EVREY single time I have used it. Including now as I write this review. I dont know what it is in it that does it, maybe the poppy, or the passion flower, or a combination of the notes combined, but I have never had such a reaction to a perfume before.

Really is a shame because it was such a lovely one at first and i felt was ever changing.

CK One Shock For Her Calvin Klein,"I have this fragrance, and I love the scent of it, but i won't be replacing it as it doesn't last more than a half hour on me.

It smells like candy floss (cotton candy) berries and chocolate, so it stands out from other youthful sweet frags, which tend to be juicy-fruit, chewing gum sweet.

It is a very youthful fragrance, feminine, but modern and sleek, rather than feminine prissy-pretty! It's a very wearable everyday scent. Suitable for work and play. My hubby loves this smell!

It only lasts a very short time though, which is such a shame. It doesn't reach far either.

If it was a bit cheaper it wouldn't matter so much, as you would spray it liberally! I have found that Ck lighter, cleaner smells don't seem to last long, but the big spicy/floral scents last ages

Eternity Summer 2014 Calvin Klein,"For me, this is a straight up cucumber-melon scent, light on the melon, vaguely reminiscent of various '90s toiletries or body mists. I've been interested in trying out perfumes with watermelon notes lately, and this one misses the mark as far as watermelon goes--doesn't have any sweet, fruity, juiciness to it. It is rather wet (perhaps the water lily + bamboo is what I am smelling as cucumber?) and more vegetal than floral to me. More than anything, this smells to me like a cucumber-melon lotion, or cucumber deodorant, cucumber soap. I get a definite ""bath product"" vibe; which I suppose could read as ""clean.""

If you want to smell like you just stepped out of a shower (that involved cucumber-melon shower gel followed by cucumber lotion and cucumber deodorant, and perhaps then dressing in clothes that have been wash with some kind of cucumber-y fabric softener...), this would be legitimately great! Maybe if you were really hot and sweaty and didn't have immediate access to a shower?? I don't -dislike- this. But I'm not particularly interested in perfumes that just make me smell showered or laundered--and again, 0 watermelon--so I don't think this is a keeper for me.",08/18/15 22:22,margoess
Eternity Summer 2014 Calvin Klein,"I had to add to my review below how much i love this. The water lilies,lotus and watermelon shine through a lot. 3 of my favorite accords. It's very feminine.

The only difference i can note is that Eternity Summer 2014 is more fruity floral and a little less bamboo and aquatic than Summer 2008 I like it.

This fragrance doesn't really smell aquatic, but it smells clean. It reminds me of synthetic clean linen which isn't a bad scent, but it wasn't what I was expecting or looking for. On my skin I get more of the white florals with a touch of bamboo, none of the watermelon or pear I was looking forward to.

It's really fresh and perfect for the summer months. It's a light, but somehow strong scent at the same time. A perfect combination of aquatic notes, floral notes, and fruity ones! It's a well-rounded scent that is not too strong in any one area in a way that's overwhelming, but also each area is well-defined and unique!

I saw that one reviewer got rose, I got that as well, but I also got lilac, which is also not listed. I enjoy these flankers every year and look forward to them. They are reasonably priced and help me welcome Spring. Macy's has it.",04/06/14 21:36,papergurl
Eternity Summer 2014 Calvin Klein,"I just bought this today on impulse, and I love it! The initial spray is a blast of floral, and smells like rose to me, although that is not one of the notes listed. That overwhelming burst dries down quickly and smells very fresh and lovely.

Defy Parfum Calvin Klein,"THIS IS NOT A REVIEW...just an observation. I am shocked that so many people on Fragrantica know what AXE smells like! Apparently, many frag heads shop at trailer park convenience stores!! Lord, I'm an elitist..",10/27/25 10:52,TheGoldenNose
Defy Parfum Calvin Klein,"Orjinal olarak satın aldığım ilk parfümdü bu. Daha önce o kadar da fazla parfüm koklamamış birisi olarak harika bir koku olarak gelmişti ve gerçek parfümlere ne kadar geç kaldığımı düşündürmüştü. O zaman mağazaya BDC alma hedefi ile gitmiştim ama satıcı bana bunu yeni çıktı diye önermişti. YAZ AYINDA. Öve öve bitiremediği bu kokunun yazlık olduğunu ona düşündüren neydi anlam veremedim. Gerçi performansı o kadar kötü ki insanlara koku ulaşmayacağı için rahatsız edeceğini düşünmüyorum. Ama yine de koku profili olarak kışlık kullanıma daha uygun. Tatlı ve aromatik kokunun içinden kakaoyu ilk günden o ham burnumla bile alabiliyordum.

Parfüm gerçek anlamda ilk parfümüm olduğu için uzun bir süre günlük hayatıma dahil olmuştu ve o zamanlarda yaşadığım duygular bu kokunun içinde gömülü. Şu an bu parfümü elimden çıkardım ama geri almak gibi bir planım var. Bu kadar spesifik olarak bana anıları/duyguları hatırlatan bir parfümüm hala yok. Mevcut şişelerimin yanında kalite/koku/performans olarak geri kalsa da bir çoğundan daha önemli bir yere sahip benim için.

Defy Parfum Calvin Klein,i tried this from a 1.5ml tester. it's ok for the first 5 minutes then it just gets too sweet and turns more feminine. i don't like it.,07/30/25 04:01,vladimirparfemdzija
Defy Parfum Calvin Klein,"I tested it in unusually hot and humid weather 🌡️💦, so it’s hard to judge it fairly. It seemed good, I guess 🤔—but I feel like I didn’t give it a fair shot. Definitely needs a proper, focused re-test 🧪🔁.",07/25/25 22:29,AbdullahK
Defy Parfum Calvin Klein,"I need to mention this first cause when I first sprayed it, I thought it was light and not projecting but I was very wrong. I walked out of the dining table and came back only to realise that it was fully in the air. This stuff projects silently but really well. Has good longevity too. Smell wise, I see AXE Chocolate there but this does not smell like that at all. It started with a clean soapy blue scent type of lavender. As it dried down, it became more powdery and the cacao shows it self there. If you go in for a closer sniff, you can smell the pepper there. My brain is connecting the dots and telling me that its F black by Ferragamo kind of pepper but with a powdery chocolaty base. Is this something very complex and unique ? Not really. Does it smell good tho ? yes it does. Looking for a clean chocolaty powdery scent thats not sickeningly sweet and has good projection and longevity ? give this a try.",06/21/25 07:02,Fabean

Defy Parfum Calvin Klein,"expensive version of chocolate axe that was popular as a kid in high school.

I cant wrap my head around the scent. cacao as a top note is a weird mix with lavender. Cant think of any situations where i would wear this.",04/24/25 16:50,Max2596
Defy Parfum Calvin Klein,"I sampled it , and liked so much that bought the 200ml at an very good price , after i broked the seal and let it to macerate for 5 weeks and after this 5 weeks the magic started like the tester from the shop i was.
What is weird after 2h i feel some fruity note that i am not sure wich is (blackcurrant or blueberries) but blends amazing with the cocoa , even that has cocoa on my skin when is applied do not smell sweet or very sweet , its more woody and i think has vetiver and , but not sure pine needles as olfactory note.
Its not a beast at sillage, but on longevity on my PH goes really well 9+ hours.
Sillage : 3/5 i wish they could make it project more then 1.5-2h and more then an arm lenght at how great smell on my skin , but for the price that i pay'ed is more then ok (99€ that was a bargain for 200ml)
Longevity 5/5 9+ hours is quite good
Versatility and Olfactory notes 5/5 in my case can wear it to everything and the fact that is not overly sweet on me is a pleasant surprise.

As a suggestion test it before or sample it and for sure not everyone will like it or love it.",03/25/25 14:39,Methadon
Defy Parfum Calvin Klein,"The balance of clean lavender and warm, comforting cocoa is really nice, and makes this an easy reach for casual every day wear.

Since spraying this first around a month ago, the lavender has calmed significantly and the cocoa is now stronger and blooms within the first ten to fifteen minutes. (It took hours to be barely noticable under the opening notes initially.)

Masculine till it dries down, then gets more unisex throughout the rest of the wear time.

12h+ noticable sillage/longevity sprayed 3 times over moisturised skin, and the slightly floral chocolate in the dry down stays as a skin scent till you wash it off.

Moderate projection with a subtle intensity. I can smell it but it's not really noticable to others unless they're right up close.",03/23/25 04:14,Bucket_list
Defy Parfum Calvin Klein,"Another fragrance with a stupid low rating it doesn't deserve.

This is a calm, blue scent that no one will be offended by. The cacao tone isn't overwhelming, and you may not even perceive it as cacao. Lavender is the star of the show: relaxing and subtly sweet.

There's something floral and slightly indolic to my nose if you smell it super close off skin, but it's very warm and inviting in the air and I don't get the indolic intimations off clothing.

Glad I gave this a shot in spite of the negative reviews. If you like soft, sweet fragrances like those in the Boss The Scent line, you'll probably dig this one.",03/19/25 17:51,FragranceAnon
Defy Parfum Calvin Klein,"I don't know how people call this ""Axe Dark Temptation""... Nowhere near close that IMO. I don't even get that cacao much honestly but yeah there is a slight nuance coming from it which is really cool and not overwhelming.
I can say that, this fragnance may not be the most unique one out there, may not be the best parfum I've ever had, but still, its crisp and clean and doesn't smell cheap. Also performance is not WEAK. This is the PARFUM edition, how people say its not strong... Surely it doesn't act like a niche, 200USD perfume, but the projection and longevity is just enough. It was a blind buy for me and I'm keepin it, my office friends also like it.

Though people stated that this a winter-fall perfume, it will also do the job in spring and summer nights. So this is kinda all around perfume with strong background. I recommend it if monetary concerns is not on your list when you are buying a perfume.

Edit: Dry phase of this perfume is AMAZING and this fragrance has some serious performance. It stayed like 8-10 hours on my skin without losing its notes and easily stayed like 2 days on my sweatshirt collar. And you get projection around 4 hours which is more than enough; people will notice you in office. I'm updating the overall score accordingly.

8.5/10 I would say.",02/12/25 23:10,Baris3804233-

Very underrated beautiful cozy scent.It opens with red pepper,lavender and spices,in the drydown goes toward sweet cacao with musk for sure.As parfum concentration projects really well for first two hours,then became nice warm bubble around you in arm lenght for next three hours.After that sits close to skin giving you very calm feeling.Like you don't want it to fade yet.
Real fall to winter perfume,like it warms you up when you applied it.Deserve more love for sure and much higher rating,like 4.25 at least.

Parfum has lavender and while the same pepper smell from the EDP project, instead of the leather it's the lavender and a Chocho background and base supports it. It smells like a CH men or maybe the extreme and the robotic paco robanne...tried to be gourmandy but it's still pretty much designer. Don't really suit the older folks...",10/26/24 18:48,JasKiew

Defy Parfum Calvin Klein,"I have been collecting for about a year now and this was the one that started it. Today in the northeast it is slightly cooler, so I decided to wear Defy. it is projecting like a beast for the first 2-3 hours of wearing it then it becomes around a 6-inch skin scent for the remaining 3-4 hours. I would say this is a perfect scent for the fall or a summer night out. the opening hits you in the face with cacao but during your second whiff you get the spiciness of the pink pepper with a cool lavender undertone. Defy is fore sure sweeter than other CK frags but it does not disappoint, if you can get it on sale grab it for the fall",08/20/24 14:10,yungmuny
Defy Parfum Calvin Klein,"Reminds me of the chocolate Axe/Lynx body spray I’d use in middle school. This is, in no way, shape or form, a blue fragrance.

Synthetic, chocolatey, peppery: imagine walking into your favourite cafe right after working out. You want to smell fresh, but you know cardio day doesn’t help a fresh cologne’s performance too much. So you spray this on.

They’ve tried to complicate it. But its complications are for the sake of complications. Lasts 5 hours on the skin. It is cheap, and it smells cheap. But it’s better than a few expensive fragrances I’ve smelled.",06/05/24 01:31,sidalwayssmellsgood
Defy Parfum Calvin Klein,"Minty, fresh and modern.

Opens with a mint note, it's fresh and a little aromatic.
Notes of chocolate-patchouli emerge but it remains fresh.
Becomes gourmand with vanilla aromas and something else that resembles coconut. Smells like a fig tree as it wafts through the air.
Retains the minty coolness quite well throughout.

Modern and masculine leaning, ages 18-45(ish.) Best worn during the day, any time of year, and fine for the office too.

Performance is fine, solid projection and lasts as a skin scent for 10+hrs.

Smells a little generic as it follows modern vanilla trends but smells nice and will pull compliments.",06/01/24 05:46,Fortyfree

This one is nothing like the edp and edt AT ALL.
That's fine, but if someone hates the other two why would they pick this one up? This should be another stand alone scent.

Anyway.

This is warm, gentle aromatics, effing lovely. I can't think off hand what it's similar to if anything, but I'd call this 'experienced nose unisex'.. you know how the black bottle of JPG is, and there's a gold one too .. and some valentinos are... that warm feel, yeah that's here.

Oh and that cheapie Beckham ... um beyond I think its called - that rounded powdery lavender- that's the aromatic level here. A bit dry too. Zero tobacco feel as I've mentioned in my reviews of the edt and edp.

Defy Parfum Calvin Klein,smells very similar to the edp with added chocolate,12/24/23 11:13,reaganknight
Defy Parfum Calvin Klein,"Oh no, I think I've just realised what this smells like.

This, to my nose at least, smells like the chocolate Lynx/Axe spray - Dark Temptation I think it's called? It has a strong, but smooth cacao note and not much else.

I mean, it's nice, but this is a smell I haven't thought of in over a decade. As a high school student, I went absolutely feral over Dark Temptation. I love chocolate, and it was different to any of the other scents they had in their range at the time. Something about the slightly dark sweetness appealed to me. That same chocolatey sweetness that this has drew me in as well.

Is it worth buying? I'm not sure. You can get 200mL of the stuff for 100 AUD, and it's certainly going to last a lot longer than a can of Lynx. It's pretty simplistic, but it does at least go in a different direction to the other blue bottle scents. I am a firm disliker of Sauvage, BdC and Dylan Blue on account of how ordinary they smell, so I appreciate that Calvin Klein has done something different with their contribution to the trend.

That said, I find the EdP much better and more interesting than this, and you can get that for the same price. I'd go with that instead of this.",12/05/23 20:38,Andasu

Defy Parfum Calvin Klein,"It smells similar to 1 Million Royal, but not nearly as sweet. The cacao note is quite prominent because the pepper seems to bring it forward earlier than you might expect. After a brief drydown, a smooth lavender sweetness comes out. The cacao is still there, and adds a kind of nutty edge to the sweetness, like a nutmeg or dry walnut accord.

Of the Defy lineup, I would say the best one is the EdP - with it's smooth leather accord. The Parfum is a safe pick for someone who wants to smell just a tad sweet and warm/spicy. A black licorice/anise note would have done well here, to give it a bit more body. Defy Parfum is pleasant, not overly expensive, and aims to land in a restrained space to avoid being divisive. I would recommend this fragrance to someone who wants to smell intriguing, but not project an ostentatious insecurity.

To those complaining about pre-release negative comments, I hear you. I assure you, this review is based off three applications to my skin, days apart - and from a tester in a retail store in Canada. This fragrance is, in fact, released - and Canada usually gets releases weeks after the US, at best. Don't worry about the overly-negative troll reviews flipping to shill-based vapid praise in a few months. Defy Parfum is nice, but not great.

This is nice but nothing to write home about imho. I feel like it is very light and doesnt last all that long. I smell the top notes of citrus but not so much after that.

The tart grapefruit note makes this incredibly refreshing, even somewhat energetic, while the cedar gives the fragrance a musky yet invigorating appeal. The vanilla and orchid notes are soft and not too overpowering. I like the type of femininity this expresses. It's not your typical sweet or floral scent, but more of an understated, casual femininity - effortless, carefree, a bit sporty, with a relaxed, clean vibe. It's modern and youthful without trying too hard. I normally wear this when I exercise or play volleyball or tennis, and I'm always happily reminded of my tomboy phase from when I was a young girl when all I ever did was play sports and didn't have a care in the world.",07/02/25 11:24,michelaahh

Still quite citrus-y in the grapefruit top, but something resinous underneath plus the red-cedar woodiness which leans a bit soapy along with the steamy citrus wafting off of it. I like this more each time I wear it. Today it's giving me some passing reminders of White Tea Elizabeth Arden (although these aren't clones). Love it still.

This is one of them. 100% unisex. Absolutely beautiful grapefruit and lemon and dries down to a more woody citrus. If you like truly unisex fragrances, or if you like citrus/grapefruit openings in your fragrance, I don’t see how you couldn’t like this. I honestly don’t think this fragrance can offend anyone. Its sillage and projection are not the greatest…however, I bought a 5oz bottle for under $20. Literally cheaper than a bath and body works mist these days and about the same lasting power as Jo Malone fragrances. I don’t understand how this does not have more hype and I’m kinda glad about it because I don’t want to smell like everyone else. If I smelled this on a male, I would go crazy… but I honestly love it just as much on myself. I would pay three times the price that this is selling for. Definitely an oldie but goodie and is a timeless freshie that I could never be without.",02/20/25 17:58,jamileenotcurtis
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,My mother was gifted this and used it as a toilet spray but i found it when it was almost finished and wanted to put the bottle on my table for display and smelled the last sprays which were very very appealing. As a man I am proud to say this is one of the best fragrances I've ever smelled and I'm planning to buy this for personal use.,02/18/25 03:54,Dagim.zs
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"CK IN2U holds so many good memories for me. It’s fresh, energetic, and effortlessly wearable, with a unisex vibe that almost leans masculine. The bright grapefruit and bergamot opening feels crisp and clean, while the vanilla and amber add a subtle warmth without being sweet.

Casual yet distinctive, this scent is perfect for anyone who loves fresh fragrances. If you enjoy unisex leaning scents, CK IN2U is definitely worth checking out.",02/14/25 14:02,Dinaina
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,I aggressively love this. I see so many this is good comments but this is aggressively good. I just dosed myself in lemon water. And as it dries down it gets creamier. The opening is bomb. Not too much it's going to be so good in the warm weather even though we don't get much of that here,02/09/25 09:12,Defragmint
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I used to enjoy wearing this perfume to the gym - it’s refreshing and invigorating. However, over time, I developed sensitivity to the amberwood chemicals that many manufacturers have started adding to perfumes in recent years to enhance sillage and longevity (though most people don’t notice their scent). Unfortunately, this perfume contains some of those compounds, and unfortunately it ruined it for me. Now, I smell a distinct screechy note that messes with the fresh and fruity accords, making it unwearable for me. Off my shelf it goes.",02/06/25 10:36,pbeloborodova
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Smells fresh, lasts about 20 minutes. I wear it to the gym",01/29/25 10:57,jeggy
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"An excellent fragrance that adapts to the wearer. A man and a woman can wear this.

I love its burst of freshness. So much romance in a bottle!

My dad smelled like this. Full of vitality, strength, and a lot of sass that surpassed any man.

This is just beautiful.

During the day this is all I want. I wake up craving this like I am starving for food. CK into You is a lemon with a pinch of sugar I don't think I'll ever be able to live without.",01/03/25 13:28,Frisskiss
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Yes, it’s a little more masculine for my taste and the longevity isn’t great, but that burst of citrus in the opening is quite refreshing. It’s a pretty great summer scent for those days when you need something light and airy and crisp.",01/03/25 08:26,jadepo21
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"This is a bit disappointing for me. I bought it because of a review, but let me tell u this doesn't last more than two 2hrs especially in winter time. The scent is not bad, but don't waste ur money on this. It's a bit synthetic and outdated. About the unisex if u like more masculine fragrances just buy the male version.",01/01/25 01:44,tedidi
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,Classic citrusy floral. Perfect for the summer or spring. It smells like fresh Lemonade with a little hint of vanilla. It smells like covering Prickly Pears in lemon and salt or making nopal (cactus) salad and drenching them in lemon juice on a hot summer day. On the dry down I can smell Orchid and Red Currant leaf.,12/28/24 15:49,Euforia323
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Fresh, citrusy vanilla. The first perfume I had when I was in high school. I remember not being able to smell it on myself a few hours after spraying it.",12/18/24 09:05,chloesevigny
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"This smells like a womans perfume to me. I'm not sure why people think this is unisex.
It's got a lovely bright citrus opening then the drydown is floral with a grassy sort of smell .
Guess it's the cactus note. After a while the grassy note dissappears and its powdery sweetness . I Don't detect any of the basenotes apart from a hint of vanilla. It's a skin scent after around 20 minutes. It's a nice summer freshie for women
Longevity around 3 to 4 hours.",11/27/24 08:27,Sniff away
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"The opening reminded me of a fresh green apple explosion (although no apple note is listed). Then it got a bit too soapy for my taste in the down.
I think all genders could wear this.",11/14/24 11:30,Sound Adream
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,This perfume is so nostalgic to me and i dont even know why,11/04/24 13:04,Iloveevil
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I think this is the first ""proper"" perfume I really liked. This perfume is a warm citrus. It sprays on with a lime-heavy scent until it dulls to a semi-sweet key lime pie kinda smell. I think it's wonderful, but I wouldn't call it the most feminine scent. It's a safe unisex, I'd say. I wonder what the male version of this line smells like. You can usually find this perfume at Burlington/TJMaxx/Marshalls/etc for $20. Super affordable and one of my go-to if I'm in the mood for a fresh scent. I recommend!",10/28/24 07:16,jy18
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,Beautiful every day sporty kinda unisex perfume. Citrusy vanilla accord. Price is good. I like to wear it with leisure clothes. Clean fresh cozy scent. Budget friendly. Highly recommend👍,10/26/24 08:24,varnyte

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"As other reviews say, it‘s quite generic but that’s why I bought it. I just wanted a perfume that didn‘t bother me. Reason why I could wear it even when I was pregnant and everything else made me sick.
It smells mostly like amber on me, my skin always pulls the sweetest notes out of perfumes somehow.",08/17/24 00:24,lala-jaenner
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I love this stuff! I've had my bottle for somewhere between 12-15 years and it smells exactly the same as it ever did.

This scent is zingy and energetic, and I've never smelled anything like it. It's a citrusy vanilla that manages to be fresh and aromatic, not cloying. I love the brightness of the grapefruit, the very soft vanilla and hints of greenness. It also has a ""glossy"" smell to it, reminding me of the high gloss pages of a magazine.

Performance is also fantastic - this stuff lasts on my clothes all day. And people here seem to have voted this as a summer scent, but I totally disagree. Back in the day I specifically used to spray this in winter! These days I see it as an excellent all-year-round scent.

If you like fresh citrus perfumes but you hate the poor longevity, you can't go wrong with this one.",08/08/24 17:29,LaMiaRosa
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,It's ok but has the smell of masculine cologne so I don't use it very often. For me it's for occasional use or after shower.,07/16/24 02:26,Fairyfer
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I spontaneously purchased this scent when I saw it on sale. In general, I love Calvin Klein perfumes. This one feels richer, more collected and mature compared to the others. A good combination of citrus freshness and maturity.",06/27/24 03:37,Nasi_Ali
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"this smells like a forest or, any kind of greenery for that matter, after it's rained. Like damp greenery in short. So it's not whimsical or cottagecore in any way, but rather, it's fresh and sporty. It's something you'd wear outdoors preferably, but i can imagine it being a staple gym scent, for both men and women. I like it!",06/22/24 16:15,Lanascola
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,It smells very generic and like any other ceder wood/lemony perfume. I regret buying it. The price is no excuse to make a perfume that is so basic...I am sorry but that's how I feel. I hate that I bought it based on reviews from a youtuber. I should know by now that smells are subjective.,06/18/24 16:54,Masiwa
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"A gorgeous perfume.. and the price? 🔥
Years ago, this girl smelled like heaven.. Then I bought it and I was in love, my skin was super compatible with this scent.
Citrusy vanilla, I can affirm that could be labeled unisex, but not masculine!!

Over the years, I got the impression that this has been reformulated, because of the longevity and some flankers I bought had this scratchy citrus that was not in a first place.. and in a way it lacked depth it had..

But I'm going to buy it regardless.. Can somebody tell me (people who love this scent maybe) is this anyhow similar to Santal Complet?

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"It just smells like some sort of men cologne or after shave, is not very feminine. I had this a few years ago. I feel like this is more suitable for men.",06/04/24 22:25,cruelraven
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I bought this one 5 years ago and didnt like it at first, found it in one of my boxes today and i smelled it again. It turned in to a sweet citrus perfume and became more feminine and strong. Just hide it and use it in a few years, u will love it",06/04/24 13:54,ranirajan
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Oh how I love to try the cheapies!. Unfortunately for me this was one of those blind buy fails. I get a blast of grapefruit in the opening (which.I like) but this disappears very quickly and all I am left with is cedar. Just two notes are all I can smell! When I purchase a fragrance and see it has cedar in it, I await it's arrival with trepidation, actually more akin to dread. It's a note that has ruined many a perfume for me, it just doesn't smell nice on my skin and I would say it's very masculine. Some fragrances I own and really like do have cedar, so I am quite confused about this.

People have said this is a freshie. Would I describe it as fresh? Well, it starts out that way and then swiftly turns into a musty, sweaty armpits kind of smell on my skin. That may be ok on a man but it's not exactly attractive or appealing on a woman lol. Not a safe blind buy then, but for the price I guess you have nothing to lose.",05/27/24 15:34,Scorpio Queen
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,Its a clean fresh scent that doesn't smell like soap or a laundry detergent. It transitions from citrus to woody and then vanilla. It stays close to the skin. Great for all year round. It works best for me in the summer without smelling like bug spray.,05/23/24 06:30,Ines65
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"This is a great freshly for the summer, indeed not very feminine, but very ""out of the shower"" citrus. To me, it reminds a lot of Green Tea from Elizabeth Arden, so I was a bit surprised when I haven't seen this one listed here as close to it.",05/20/24 11:37,Tsmarcondes
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I adore this perfume. I blind bought it because it was so cheap at Walmart. I actually didn't like it at first, as I loved the bright grapefruit opening but I thought the mid became too masculine, or really, too CK One in DNA. However, I sampled this one off and on for about 3 weeks, and now I'm really in love. I don't find the mid too masculine; in fact, I've embraced its astringent tea note (despite tea not being listed) amidst a backdrop of soft vanilla. It's like having a cup of tea with a lemon scone. It's both uplifting and cozy at the same time with that little hug of non-gourmand vanilla. It makes me really happy to wear this and the heat makes it shine! Longevity is quite good, as is sillage. The only thing I don't love is the plastic atomizer, but besides that, I would definitely repurchase. It's something I would keep in my collection as long as I can get it!",05/19/24 17:21,mschumps
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"On the blotter, CK IN2U for Her initially smells predominantly citrusy, but on the skin, it transforms into a rough vanilla with hints of grapefruit. I love this unsweetened vanilla, which gives the fragrance a special charm. While the fragrance starts off bright, it soon blends with the skin, creating a clean skin effect. This effect is achieved thanks to the cedar and vanilla in the base.

I chose this perfume for summer and find it to be an excellent neutral scent for various occasions – whether it's for a walk, sports, or work. Although the fragrance doesn't strike me as too masculine, I think it can be unisex, suitable for both women and men.",05/14/24 20:52,MuraSakurazava
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I am not sure why this is marketed specifically as a woman's fragrance when it is completely unisex or could be even marketed as men's cologne that could also be unisex. There is no sweetness. It is just a carbonated citrus blast but moderate and less screechy or in your face at least and then dries down into subtle whiff base notes.

This would be ideal for those who prefer to share fragrances or prefer an androgynous understated clean smell.",05/04/24 12:10,toodaloo
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"This fragrance reminds me so much of the Anthropologie Capri Blue Volcano candle, it’s sweet and citrusy, but in the best way possible. It’s sugary lemon goodness and definitely not offensive, 100% one for Summer 🍋",05/04/24 11:42,Hatch71
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Its a beautiful and unique scent. But to me it is masculine, to my husband it is feminine. I would love it if he wore it but he doesn’t. Neither do I. Its complicated.",04/30/24 12:29,bashak
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"A woody creamsicle scent that, despite being marketed towards women, I think it has a clean masculine edge to it. It is a citrus perfume that I think shines in colder weather. I find this one to be very long lasting and the citrus note stays for a very long time. You can get a large bottle of this for a really good price too!",04/23/24 05:17,perfumeleopard
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I keep trying this one because I like the opening, but a few hours in, it's just a no. It loses the citrus scent (which I really like) and turns masculine after the dry down.",04/15/24 18:27,janet.3

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"This is a very weak short lived slightly citrus tea scent.

The bottle is difficult to handle while spraying too.

I'm usually impressed by CK but this 1 is a disappointment.",04/08/24 15:10,Sassy1
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"very generic, “blah” scent. not bad, but nothing spectecular. it smells like a cheap drug store body mist which you won’t remember at all how it smelled like after finishing the bottle. to be honest, even some avon perfumes are more catchy than this.

if you want to buy a perfume gift, in2u is a great choice. so dull but it won’t make anyone upset... you just spray it until you empty the bottle and won’t remember it ever again.",04/03/24 13:40,burcaktugrul
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Uhm, citrusy, perfect for the gym in a hot summer day. It doesn't smell artificial to me. I would say it has a Unisex vibe. I mixed it with Pink Sugar and it made it fresh, I believe now I can wear Pink Sugar at the gym😅👌",03/26/24 15:49,bailarina
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"More like a masculine scent for me... gave it to my brother after I got the bottle. But it is versatile, gives a fresh scent and could be used for a daily use.",03/11/24 09:30,ariel5914

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Bought this for my mum and she says it's masculine so I bought her Coco Chanel instead.

It's unisex so I took this for myself as it smells like Missoni Pour Homme. I'll try it again in the summer and update this 🌞",02/10/24 10:04,Wizzie08
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I like this. Different than my normal favorites - the vanilla would usually be a no go for me - but everything else here keeps it on the fresh side of sweet. Casual and easily unisex. Lasts all day for me. I don't reach for it enough but I'm always pleased with it when I do. Can't imagine wearing it in heat, though - I think it might be a bit stifling in warmer weather.",02/07/24 15:37,Indignatious83
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"When I first sprayed, I thought it was too masculine. The weather was also warm and humid at the time. I have let it sit for a month or so and resprayed it tonight and I like it a lot more, it smells very unisex, but now it is colder. I live in FL, so how perfumes smell/perform in the heat is crucial. I hope it remains unisex leaning feminine when I try it again in hot weather! I get an aromatic citrus, a profile I have been looking for that doesn't smell masculine - please let this be the one!",02/06/24 20:39,MandalaaXO
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"For me, however, it almost brings back a Christmas atmosphere.... where you can almost smell the garlands made of pine needles, it must be the red juniper reported here by Fragrantica, I loved the beginning, loving citrus fruits, I really liked it.. but it's the aftermath that I don't like and doesn't convince me! I was definitely expecting a perfume that was sensual enough because of the orchid, but more than sensual it feels a little stale, almost old! I purposely looked for the check/fresh on the site and it doesn't depend on the perfume (I thought it was bad), probably too amber for my nose, it gives me the feeling of an old, truly adult men's perfume! Yes for men because I feel it is more masculine than feminine and I assure you that I own several unisex brands from this brand, indeed perhaps more tending towards the masculine than feminine gender! As always when it comes to noses, everyone has their own and so be it, otherwise we would be poor... we would all be the same.",01/28/24 08:17,Ariete76
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"At first I thought this was very masculine, almost like an aftershave. I then appreciated the fresh, crisp, citrus notes, although I would class this as a unisex fragrance, rather than feminine.

This also performs like a body mist for me, so I use this to layer rather than on its own. So for the performance, I would say it's overpriced.

I would not repurchase this again.",12/26/23 15:23,Tashateex
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I love to wear this fragrance during colder months due to amber and vanilla notes. It reminds me of a citrus body lotion, it is fresh but at the same time it has this lotion-like smell. After 3h i can't smell the fragrance on myself, but i received compliments on it even after 8+ hours.",12/23/23 21:44,Anhar
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Fresh citrus without extra sweetness. It has a bit of brightness to it, nice bit for someone who enjoys lemon or orange scents. I dont get any vanilla or green from the cedar in here at all

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I love this scent, but I only wear it in October, so I don't get much use out of it. It's autumn in a bottle - I'm missing the freshness that a lot of people are mentioning, but instead there's a bitter orange opening to it, settling into a smoky, earthy amber. I could maybe stretch this to late August, but I really think this smells better in the cold air.",12/19/23 15:31,hollyhwd
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"An all season, daytime scent that does not live up to other offerings by Calvin Klein.

If CK IN2U Her maintained the beautiful green fruitiness of the opening, I would be in LOVE. But Almost immediately into the drydown it becomes a powdery sour vanillic scent. The Amber in here is the cloying, powdery variety; and it smells both sickly and uninteresting?

I wish this was more of a balsamic Amber, with a prominent cactus note. But unfortunately, this one is a pass.",12/12/23 11:30,Sanguine_scenttrails

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I got this as a gift from my parents back in 2007 who unfortunately had no idea what I like and it didn't suit me at all in the long run as I am more of a woody smokey ambery person.. It had a strong grapefruit smell that I think was a bit overpowering and I felt slightly nauseous at first, but I remember it drying down quite gently and became more soft as the amber developes and actually lands on a nice creamy ending. However it aged quite badly because now when I retried it (the same bottle, as I never used it back then) it now smells like toilet cleaner and I blaspherely use it as a air freshner in the bathroom - but mind you this is after a good 16 years haha.",10/27/23 00:57,jroerholt
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Grapefruit comes across strong, but creamy rather than sharp due to the musk/vanilla. I live in the tropics where wearing strong perfumes is not the norm, and I find this comes across a little bit too strong in the day, as well as in office environments. I slowly stopped using it in favour of fresher, more green scents. I think it works best for hot, tropical nights out, and in late spring/early autumn.",10/10/23 09:03,kuribits

Didn't know what to expect with a Calvin Klein perfume. Well got N2U and holy moly, blown away again, I can see how some other people might not like it, but I LOVE the citrus vanilla scent. It's not super heavy and not super overwhelming in my opinion and I just love how it brings on a really happy and just relaxing scent. I personally think it's just a perfectly blended Perfume",08/24/23 17:31,FeralRat
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Fresh CITRUS Over VANILLA-WOODS Scent. Opens with a fresh citrus-y burst of pink-grapefruit & bergamot accented by red-currant-leaf. That segues into the cactus & orchid heart. Cactus here bringing some green, juicy tones and something near a tea note, while orchid brings soft powdery florals and helps to continue the faint fruitiness of the opening citrus notes a little into the heart. This all rests on a base of vanilla & red-cedar resin that combine into a lather of sweet, powdery, faintly-soapy, woody & aromatic notes. This has average performance for a spring through fall wearing experience, although the citrus component lasts only part-way into the heart.

Overall: affordable, unisex, gorgeous fresh citrus over vanila-woods scent with average performance for a spring through fall wearing experience. It's a love for me. Cheapie gem: Enjoy!

Update 06/17/25: I've come to appreciate the artistry of this more and more. There's a delicacy here in the portrayal of the red-cedar which in the sillage evokes steamy saunas and red-cedar chests. It's gotten a lot more woody over time. Still quite citrus-y in the grapefruit top, but something resinous underneath plus the red-cedar woodiness which leans a bit soapy along with the steamy citrus wafting off of it. I like this more each time I wear it. Today it's giving me some passing reminders of White Tea Elizabeth Arden (although these aren't clones). Love it still.",08/24/23 05:28,suzanne_ronald

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"So this is my second review of this fragrance, the first bottle of this, I absolutely hated, it smelt like latex gloves to me in the drydown, I just couldn't stand it. A few years after this, I got another bottle, this time a partial bottle in a bundle of secondhand fragrances, and wow, it's gorgeous, it's a soft fluffy lemon vanilla with a bit of woodiness. The woodiness is almost like pine, like what I smell in Chloe Nomade but much lighter than that. I've been spraying this one like crazy this summer and loving it. I think there must be either a reformulation or a need to let bottles sit for a while, because the two bottles that I've tried have been night and day, this might also explain the very split opinion on this fragrance in the reviews here...",08/17/23 06:13,qofb

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Please can people that don’t understand in citrus fragrances stop leaving comments on such type of scents. Like it is supposed to be sour/tart. It citrus dominated fragrance. It is supposed to be a blast of citrus (bergamot, lemon, grapefruit etc) in your face! That’s the point of lemony,citrusy notes sometimes!!!!! Those fragrances are usually are used in very hot and humid environments, cause it’s one of the most refreshing things you could wear when it’s 100°f outside and you can’t literally breathe outside. And no in those situations it doesn’t smell like detergent/dish soap etc.
Now about the fragrance great citrus and aromatic fragrance! It does however barely lasts on my skin. Till the moment I get to that gorgeous vanilla dry down it mostly disappears. Otherwise smells expensive with some niche aromas in it. I even prefer it over Chanel Chance eau fraiche (despite that Chanel’s fragrance is one of the best citrusy fragrances)",07/24/23 18:42,Barbarossa

I have been looking for some citrus scents that wouldn't break the bank, and this one obviously doesn't. I found a bottle at Ross. I LOVE the opening of this fragrance! Terrific citrus forward scent! That lasted about 10 minutes. Then as it started to dry down, the familiar aroma of Calvin Klein fragrances of yore (and I'm of the age to know yore), came through. It was then I remembered how much I didn't like Calvin Klein's DNA. I didn't like it then and I still don't. I had to scrub it off to rid myself of the memories of young guys wearing too much of the CK scents years ago and not being able to stay in their vicinity. At least my bad memories only cost me about $20. Anyone in the US want a bottle with about 3 sprays out of it? I'll give it to you cheaper than Ross!",07/13/23 17:11,Savage1
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,This is a sharp citrus with a subtle sweetness & a woodsy undertone. IMO it's more unisex than feminine. I've had it for a while now & I have layered it a few times but do not reach for this much at all. Today it dawned on me to try it out as a bug repellent so I will see how it goes.,07/04/23 10:01,NY2NJMo

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,actually such an amazing unisex perfume. i got this in spain last year and forgot how amazing this fragrance is. i adore the vanilla aromatic blend this perfume has (surprising because i usually stray away from aromatic perfumes) and i think this might be my new favorite summer time perfume.,06/28/23 12:29,oddsoy
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"My mom got me this perfume as a gift for my 19th birthday and I've loved jasmine citrusy things ever since as a true summer baby.
Before that I didn't really care much about fragrances except for the occasional powdery perfume on some of her friends.
I remember I ran out of it pretty fast and only managed to get a second bottle years later but now that we've been reunited I'm not letting it go.
Fresh, sparkly and warm like summer should be.",06/27/23 16:12,hvnent
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,It is really nice one! First time I bought it in 2008 when I came to england and used it with pleasure. Now bought it again in 2023 and Im glad I did. It is such a nice scent for spring/summer.,05/23/23 15:17,scent.2go
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"This surprised me because it smells really good! It's a soft citrus but it goes away as quickly as I spray it, my skin eats it right up. The bottle is so hideous to me though. The price for this isn't bad but I couldn't imagine wearing this in any other season other than summer. A good cheapie for those in warmer climates.",05/22/23 18:27,la.femme.scent
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"This one is marvelous. Is springy, summery and it is so nice. This is a citrus heaven mixed with freshness and a hint of sweetness, I am in love with this one. It makes you so happy after spraying it on yourself, it has also a hint of acidity but this fragrance is so well thought.
The design of the bottle is simple yet elegant and cool.
I recommend you trying it in store, but I have to say, again, that this one is so amazing.",05/18/23 08:54,Night of April
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"My first impression of this scent was sweet iced tea. It has a greenish quality to it and it's sugary and lemony at the same time so it brought back memories of Summer. It's not super unique, but it's pleasant. I think it's a good everyday sunny day perfume. It's not dark and seductive, because it wasn't intended to be; it's lighthearted so don't take it too seriously. One qualm I have is that I can smell alcohol mildly in the background which I wish wasn't there. I'd say it lasts and projects moderately, but it won't perform like a beast, what citrus does? In general, I prefer more floral notes in my perfumes, but if this is your vibe, then it's a good cheapie. I'm also a fan of the bottle, I think it's a fun shape that makes it looks modern and sleek.",05/08/23 12:00,perfumaphile

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"With this one, I have found my perfect white-t-shirt scent! Fresh but a bit sweet, maybe a bit shampoo-ish? I like it a lot for those sunny days in spring and summer!
@veromoth : is it the same for you when you spray it on your shirt? To me it is not so masculine, maybe unisex…",04/19/23 03:52,Utopia76
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Wow... I'm so disappointed with this one.
My colleague wears it sometimes, and when I compliment her on her scent it just always turns out to be in2u.
I decided to try it for myself, and... oh man... literally. It is so manly on my skin. Is it really the same scent my colleague uses? She definitely wears it better than me.
I know the price is tempting, but I would recommend (as for any other perfumes) to try it on your skin before you buy it.",04/12/23 08:43,veromoth

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"It's a very likeable scent - not a lovable one for me. I've known it for years and tested it a multitude of times but never felled compelled to get a bottle. I got one a few days ago due to an awesome price offer. And I still like it - but not totally love it. It is very user-friendly - feminine, citrussy-sweet, like an overly sweetened lemon ice tea. But that's the point. It soon gets too sweet. The wonderful freshness of citrussy notes soon gets overwhelmed by the sweet/ambery notes. I'd kick out the amber and vanilla and it would be just fine and it would fit the bottle design perfectly! Still - it's worth trying and buying and having - just in case you have no better idea what to wear on a given day. It's pretty versatile. In my opinion it may be really good on a late summer/early fall sunny day - when you don't want to let the summer go but already know it's on it's way...",03/15/23 15:52,LadyPilot
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"IN2U's opening is so gorgeous, it's a shame how quickly it dry's down. I still like the dry-down, though. It's a classic musky grapefruit scent that's pretty one-dimensional. For the price point, I can't really complain. This is a nice out-the-shower everyday fragrance that I'll be using more with spring upon us.",03/14/23 10:47,KeyWestKitten
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"This is nice! I like it, don’t love it. Very inexpensive to buy a huge bottle of, which is good as this is one I have to over spray to get any lasting power or sillage. It opens very fresh, reminds me of lemongrass or verbena. It’s green and juicy and citrusy for the first 10-15 minutes. As it dries you get the vanilla coming in and kind of turns the fragrance into a really mellow creamy, cozy, sweet lemon/grapefruit scent.",03/01/23 07:41,Beffuhnee
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Strong citrusy scent with some hint of green. Overall pleasant.

Very poor projection, silage, longevity. It becomes a skin scent within minutes.

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,I find this to be pleasant but nothing outstanding. It’s mostly vanilla with a vague citrus-green character. Good for the gym or hanging around the house but I wouldn’t wear it if you want people to notice your perfume. Light to moderate longevity and sillage.,02/19/23 18:48,arizonaruby
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"What a disappointing buy. I purchased a large bottle based on the review recommendations here. The scent is pleasant enough, but it does not last at all. I gave myself a good eight sprays before leaving the house. Wrists, clothes, hair. When I walked into work 30 minutes later, it was gone. If I press my nose against my wrist, I can kind of smell it. I have had good like with the other CK scents, so this was a big flop for me.",02/17/23 08:33,lmscully
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"It smells very pleasant, clean and fresh. It's such a shame that it doesn't last long!",02/13/23 15:20,Andja23
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Needed a cheapy for the gym (saw the rec on youtube so I blind bought it) and this perfume serves that purpose perfectly. Top note smells like you just squeeze a citrus, kinda grapefruit-y rather than lemon-y since it's a bit sweet, but very fresh. The citrus scent lingers for around 2-3 hours then settles down to a creamy scent, not too sweet but very comfortable. Will not give you a migrane. Many people said that longevity wasn't good. Personally I find it has very decent longevity, around 5-6 hours or even longer, although after 3 hours, you're probably the only one who smell it. Good projection I feel, not coying at all and it makes me feel pretty and happy when working out. Doesn't smell cheap, in fact, it smells quite interesting for the price. But also in a way, kinda basic because of the citrus top note but I don't mind. Personally I like it way more than D&G light blue because of the sweet, feminine base note. Overall, I am super happy with the purchase. 10/10

You prolly won't like it as much if you buy it to use every day. But it's the perfect gym fragrance especially for women, but I think men can pull this off too.",02/13/23 00:38,jbaby283
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Fresh sweet-ness!

I agree with the comments made by ‘London Lady’ just below my comment AND I also bought it because of YouTuber Ksenja 👍

I have wanted to try this one for some time now, but I was afraid of the citrus notes. I’m not big on the coldness of freshies……but the vanilla really warms this one up for me. 😊",02/07/23 06:12,Katchele
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I too purchased this on a YouTuber's recommendation (Ksenja). I wouldn't normally blind buy...actually that is not true - I try not to blind buy, but sometimes, if the price is right, I just can't resist it! The price of this fragrance is excellent, although I don't normally buy Calvin Klein due to the scent never really lasting with me. However, this sounded like I would enjoy it so I went ahead and ordered it. So here is my verdict: this is lovely! It's a sweet freshness that is softened by the warmth of vanilla to create a lemony creaminess. What immediately sprang to mind was that this is very similar to Tom Ford's Costa Azzurra - the difference being that one costs around £150 + and the other is £14! I liked Costa Azzurra, but could never justify paying a luxury price for what was to me just a ""nice"" scent. Tom Ford's has a little more body and depth to it, but since both fragrances have the same (IMHO) silage and longevity I'd much rather go for the Calvin Klein. IN2U is an everyday perfume that you can overspray, respray, sniff-your-wrist-all-day and enjoy. It's a fun, fresh, pretty scent that gives off a classy, clean, sparkling vibe.",02/04/23 12:48,London Lady
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Just purchased this upon a YouTuber’s recommendation. There are some good notes, but I’m getting an overarching bug spray vibe on me personally. I really hope this scent can either age in the bottle or develop on my skin to where I don’t get this sensation anymore. I’ll still give it a chance, as I also have a sinus infection and may not be all there smell-wise.",02/02/23 00:30,M_Squared
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"It took me a while to fall in love with this scent, which has a lot of things going on. At first, I kept getting the amber, the cedar, and the orchid. It was ok, but I couldn't make heads or tails of it. So I let it macerate and develop. I tried it the other day, and was so happy with the scent! Finally, the citrusy sweetness started to come out, but not in a sharp way. Rather, the vanilla teased it out beautifully, playing background to the first notes of the bergamot and grapefruit. The other notes poke their heads out very softly. I've started to wear it in this muggy, warm weather and I love it! It is sweet, pretty, and elegant. The scent bubble around me is delicious!",01/23/23 20:37,Bachi
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"A fleeting perfume, you spray it, you smell it and it’s gone in a flash.

Sad to say, because I like the scent, if only it would linger.",01/16/23 12:05,kiaoi
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Stole this from my mum and got the karma i deserved (she didn’t mind though). This huge bottle was such a hate pan for me but I got through it. This is such a nothing scent. I’ve said it before but Calvin Klein excels at mens fragrances but drops the ball for womens. It seems like they are all created by men, for men.

This is fresh, citrus, sharp and alcohol. Nicer than CK One but kinda related.

If you are into feminine and or girly scents, this one is not for you.",01/16/23 05:18,peachygal
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Call me crazy, but this remided me so much of how Dior Sport was on my historical boyfriend.

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Honestly so relaxing. I've been on the fence about getting this for about an year now but I finally decided to get it. I was looking for a freshie for my little work out yoga session at home because I realized i had nothing really fitting for just refreshing after a shower.
It's a clean citrus, nothing strong like toilet cleaner but definitely zesty. It doesn't last too long but when it becomes a skin scent it's a really subtle soft vanilla. I really like it, it feels really comfortable and it wont overwhelm you if you over-spray.",01/06/23 23:38,menmen
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"God this is good. Blind bought based on reviews. The first time I spritzed it I was transported to high school memories. I would recognize the scent anywhere - the fragrance of my first love and first heartbreak. Not what I thought I was signing up for purchasing this LOL.

Now I'm wondering how much of a part this scent had in my feelings for this person. Because this perfume is GOOD.

It leans masculine to me, in fact I remember telling them I ""liked their cologne"" only to be corrected that it was a women's perfume. However, I think any woman or man could rock this. It's both fresh and sexy, and the citrus sticks around far longer than it does in other fresh scents I've tried.

It's winter right now and this feels cozy somehow, but I can't wait to rock it in the heat.

It's versatile, inexpensive, unisex, decently long lasting. Signature scent worthy, I'd gladly grab this regardless of the outfit / occasion, save for maybe a super formal event.",01/04/23 12:39,whisperology
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Has a very clean and citrusy scent, almost lemony. I don't really smell the spicy notes everyone is mentioning.

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Very underrated cheap fragrance. Hell, this smells more expensive than the price tag.

In2U for Her is a fresh, citrusy, spicy and fruity fragrance. The opening is really harsh, but the magic starts after 5 minutes.

Refreshing, but soothing. Playful, but not brash. You can wear it anytime as it is very inoffensive.

As a bald, fully bearded man, I don’t have a problem wearing this fragrance. But I think for me it’s best to wear In2U in casual settings.

Longevity is around 5 hours-ish, with moderate projection in the first hour.

Very solid.",12/01/22 21:05,gxbjw
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"To start off, as this was my #1 impression when first trying: this EDT is way more masculine than I was expecting, and I was pleasantly surprised. Slowly, I've been getting more and more into masculine and unisex scents, shying away from traditionally feminine perfumes. I'm discovering that I love citrus, wood, and green fragrances, so CK IN2U fits the bill perfectly.

The notes of cactus, orchid and red cedar were intriguing... On first spray, I didn't really smell much. It kind of smelled like nothing. So I sprayed again, figuring that since it's EDT it just needs an extra push to come alive. Now I could smell it perfectly, strong citrus right off the bat: it smelled so lemony for a very brief moment, then grapefruit and bergamot took over for a few minutes. Unisex, leaning neither fem or masc. Five minutes later, and it smells like straight up man's cologne to me, mostly in the notes of cedar and amber. I enjoy it immensely, wood and pine notes have a calming effect on me, but some who are looking for a more feminine perfume may be disappointed. The only thing I would consider feminine about the drydown is the vanilla.

Sillage isn't exceptional, but occasionally I'll get a whiff of it when I'm moving around which is always nice. Always good to own at least a couple perfumes that aren't too loud. Lasts around 6 hours on me. As a side note, a man I sat next to on a Greyhound to Salinas wore a strong cologne very very close to this one, so IN2U smells just like Northern California to me.",11/06/22 10:00,kittywhiskers
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I used to like it when it was released and bought it now because of nostalgy. It’s still a pleasant citrusy scent, but the sillage and longevity is extremely weak. If you want a citrusy fredh scent I would rather buy D&G Light Blue intense, which is IMO way way better than this one. Now I only use the CKIn2u as a gym-scent. Will not repurchase it and I do not recommend it.",10/30/22 06:20,Linnsim

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"After a slow start, this has grown on me and is now one of my favorites. It opens with a big fruity flourish that put me off for a while, just because it seems kind of simple and juvenile. The opener reminds me of the fragrances I used to wear in middle school. But it doesn't take long for IN2U to drydown into a spicy, woody, unique fragrance with a surprising sweet center. Much more grownup and complex than the opening promises! I bought a 15ml sample but I like it enough to go for a full-size bottle. I think of IN2U as a warm weather, daytime, suitable-for-work fragrance, and it seems firmly unisex to me. It's warm and spicy enough, though, that I will try it when the weather cools down and see what happens. Looking forward to it.",08/10/22 14:28,Macabre_Cadabra
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"This is one of my favorite warm weather fragrances. The citrus stays for hours before becoming an slightly sweet woody fragrance. This is very smooth and well blended considering the cost and quality of the bottle. It doesn’t have amazing performance, but most of my citrus freshies don’t. This is definitely unisex even though it isn’t marketed that way. It’s right up my alley and every time I wear it, I am pleasantly reminded how much I love this.",08/07/22 21:13,AmberDawn22
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I am really into unisex perfumes and generally fresher scents and this one I really love. It's not the typical freshie, to me it has more depth to it. Performance is not great, but I don't mind overspraying since it's so affordable. The reason I bought it is because to me it has a striking similarity to Replica Jazz Club, another favourite of mine. It's almost like CK IN2U is the teenager version of Jazz Club, that said it's way more appropriate for day time wear, also very office-friendly since the projection is very little. Deffinately a white t-shirt, summer time, casual scent in the best way possible.",07/31/22 12:40,vik5

I don't get any vanilla in this, even though it's listed. I think I'd like it if it were a tad sweeter, and it almost seems a tad masculine to me. I gave it a full day's wear the other day on a hot day, and was underwhelmed by the scent. Longevity was pretty decent though. I'll give this some time and see if it grows on me.

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"This is such a neutral fragrance. It's bones are even inoffensive. It's unisex and citrus! I can see anyone wearing this. Male or female, teen or mature.

Honestly it's a hard one to pin down due to it being so ... Nothing.

The only thing I can say for sure about this is that if you over spray the amber can be too much. Definitely more of a daytime scent, maybe even for the gym. Fresh but not green or aquatic in any way I was expecting.

Like I would wear this after playing soccer. It's a bit like ... The memory of grass.

Very 90s.",06/21/22 13:35,Snifferdoodle
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,I would describe this as a slightly creamy citrus. Starts off very citrusy but the vanilla starts to peak through in the dry down and says there. Fragrance is light and airy. Loved this as a teenager. My mum loves this too. I guess it’s perfect for the very young or more mature crowd.,06/17/22 01:52,Tunzz
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Very fresh scent, citrus is the star and it smell beautiful on me for the 10 minutes it last on my skin. Definitely unisex in my opinion, I tried on my boyfriend and it was a lot more expressive on his skin, I loved it and could really smell the green notes come out. I agree that it does not smell synthetic to my nose, the grapefruit smells real and delicious.

I might wear this to the gym or somewhere I don't want to project much of anything, but will probably give to my boyfriend as it smells much nicer and more complex on him. For reference I have sensitive/dry type skin and he has more balanced/slightly oily skin type. Even as I am typing now I can barely even smell it on myself from 10 minutes ago :'(",06/16/22 22:06,rubybelle

It costs little, but unfortunately due to the low intensity it is worth even less. A defect that the perfumes produced by Coty often have. A pity...",06/05/22 02:19,Dark.Scent
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"In the description it says, ""Calvin Klein demonstrates that he still knows what young people need,"" which is cringe, and saying so only demonstrates the opposite. But that doesn't matter to me! It actually smells really good--there's a milkiness that just works in this fragrance, and I love the cedar. I'm surprised no one else mentions a lactonic impression from this. 🤷♀️ I am not sure about whether Coty is this watering-down Devil whom people have described; I wish I could say for sure, but I don't have the experience to tell. If they are doing that, the hatred is really justified. CK IN2U does have a strong alcohol smell upon spraying, which dissipates. I have the 100 ml bottle, which I feel like could last me at least two summers. But I do not wear this every day by any means. I go through streaks when I wear it repeatedly, then forget about it completely. I actually do find this fragrance sexy when I am in the right mood.

Update 09/02/22: I may have to disagree a bit with my first impressions, because now I don't feel like this ""just works."" I feel like IN2U really should work, I don't know why it doesn't work, and it's not just the name and the bottle. Feels unfinished.",06/03/22 11:47,Yes Malena
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,This was a blind buy because of YouTube… let me say I don’t like citrus or cedar that much however something about this frangrance keeps drawing me in. The dry down on me is a bit too masculine but I’ve been layering it with VS bare vanilla and I’m loving it. I want to try ckin2u gold which is supposed to be this but better,05/21/22 19:05,Mandii_mondo7
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I think this is a very good parfum, especially for the price! I’m usually not a very citrusy fragrance kind of person, but the citrus notes in combination with the base notes of vanille and amber just work wonderfully! It’s fresh and clean but still feminine and it has a bit of elegance to it. Definitely worth trying!",05/14/22 06:29,Elisabeth_93
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"This was my signature for a long time, all day, every day/ night, any occasion. This is very citrusy and bright in the beginning but it does not dry down that way. Sexy but not dirty, Fresh & clean but not soapy. Last all day/ all night, 8+hrs. Highly recommend 10/10, bringing this back out for spring/ summer. Sooooo many compliments every time!",05/10/22 21:27,princesslopez4890
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Great Great freshie ! I love the grapefruit at the top and the vanilla that envelops it. There's definitely that Calvin klein dna present. It's a great every day, non offensive office type scent. Great for its value.",05/10/22 07:46,SarahKatrina
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I wore this in a store the other day, and the sales associate assisting me needed a managers help and she mentioned to him she kept smelling pledge furniture cleaner so maybe this isn't a compliment getter. It's not for everyone but anyone can wear it if that makes sense. It's unisex smelling and never leans too masculine or feminine. It starts like warm pledge imo but the drydown is fresh and sweet. This works very well in hot summer days if you're wanting something unique and not a typical aquatic or fruity scent. Seems like a fragrance you either really like or you really don't. It smells really lovely to me.",04/28/22 15:37,Ghostx
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"This smells like fresh squeezed orange juice in the opening and dries down to a vanilla, green fragrance. It doesn't last long and somehow smells like a typical CK fragrance. Jeans and white Tshirt. Very casual. I consider this a gym fragrance.",04/25/22 20:33,lauraimelda
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"As every citrus, this lasts like an hour on me. BUT thats not a problem at all. To me this is the perfect summer fragrance - its a fresh lemony, orangey vanilla from start to finish. It smells like something you have smelled for the last 20 years (which is also kinda true).
To describe it best I would say that it smells cheap, but not in a bad manner, more like a fabric softener. This fragrance smells like clean sheets or laundry that you have just pulled out of the machine - this is what I mean when I say cheap. I love it and its also totally worth the money even with the poor longevity.
Everyone loves the CK One for a summer fragrance, but this is better.",04/25/22 02:11,Ninalovesclassy
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I have a huge problem with finding ''summer'' perfumes cause I don't like the generic citrus perfumes, eg. Light Blue, and sometimes my usual perfumes are a bit too much on 40+ weather. With that said, I have been absolutely obsessed with in2U since 8th grade. My friend used to wear it a lot and I got myself a 150ml bottle that I still have to this day. I think it was one of the first, if not the very first perfume I have ever had and I remember begging my mom to buy it for me cause back then I didn't have much money.
I personally feel an intense orange blossom in this one, and maybe it's the blend with the grapefruit and vanilla, but I just think orange blossom when I wear it. What can I say, it's the perfect summer day fragrance that you can not overspray, literally even if you have soaked your shirt it still smells nice and not overpowering. Longevity is not good, but I don't mind at all for the price, I will just keep it on me and spray all day long, it just smells like ''happy'' (still don't know if it's the memories that I have with it, but it puts me in a good mood). It reminds me of looong hot summer nights out with friends, maybe after a few drinks, you just laugh and have a good time. You can't go wrong with it, they have done a very good job with this one and I know I will forever have it in my collection.

So, YESS BUY IT IT'S AMAZING!!!!! :)",04/24/22 08:43,Helena Voltaire
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,I'm very disappointed... The opening is amazing it smells very expensive but after an hour or two it starts smelling very faint and almost like a plastic citrus smell.

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"It's not bad at all, but I would never classify it as feminine or even unisex - this is a very masculine scent. I love citruses and cedar, but I'm sorry, this is straight up men's aftershave.
The notes and reviews had me so excited, but sadly, this is not for me. It's a linear grapefruit/juniper scent (with no sweetness at all) and is quite potent for an EDT. A good afforable freshie for men.",03/15/22 13:06,Aromantra
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"If you’ve ever been to The Whaler in Santa Monica and had their raspberry lemonade, you’ll know this perfume smells almost exactly the way the drink tastes (if that made any sense)! Only difference is that the perfume has a hint of vanilla added to it.
This scent has easily become one of my favorites. I’ve been wearing it pretty much nonstop since I bought it! It has a really bright citrus opening and the dry down is a perfect mix of warm vanilla amber with a hint of that citrus still lingering.",03/14/22 20:06,Bri.md
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I am honestly still surprised I like this scent, as it doesn't really fit in with anything I usually go for. It's crisp and fresh, with just the slightest hint of warmth. I can smell the red cedar pretty prominently in the dry down, but the citrus lingers for quite a while too. It's just a really lovely, unusual and yet inoffensive scent, and seems to last for a while compared to other scents in it's price range.",03/14/22 00:58,CeruBlues

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"How fresh! I'll admit I got a bit tricked by the vanilla, since I thought the dry down would be sweeter, but it isn't sweet at all. After the sparkly top notes fade away, but before the dry down, there's a unique note that I'm assuming is the cactus, and I can't help but find that mid phase so damn charming. It's definitely a T-shirt and jeans kind of fragrance, for me. There's something about it that screams casual without trying too hard.",03/08/22 13:44,sybilline
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Very fresh and aromatic citrusy perfume. I had it in the past, I sold it. I have bought it these days and it is perfect. I have many fresh citrusy scents, but this is a little bit different, special and it can be unisex I think so.",03/08/22 05:19,TatianaChoco
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Ok after almost six monthes finally I’m writing this review…
First of all this perfume is totally a hot summer day fragrance, it’s not suitable for any other season and also not suitable for nights.
For me I dislike citrus perfumes so it took me long time to get used and accept how does it smells also when it dries down all of sudden it gets warm and heavy because it has vanilla and amber in base notes.
It can be actually considered as a unisex fragrance also, the first time I sprayed it I though that they made a mistake by putting male perfume in the female bottle … so yeah its a summer day refreshing citrus unisex perfume.",02/22/22 22:56,Yussra smki

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Lovely grapefruit burst opening with some vanilla. Dries down a bit green, ambery and woody, not too sweet, not too herbal but ultimately also not super impressive. I can see the cactus associations. Could be a nice summer cheapie. Juniper makes this slightly masculine, can easily be unisex. Quite enjoying drydown which seems still citrussy I guess due to the tartness of the cassis.",02/17/22 07:30,Cherry_Darling
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Disappointed in this- I'd heard good reviews and thought I'd enjoy it so I blind bought it at TJ Maxx. At first spray this is an okay citrus, maybe a bit powdery and odd but not bad. However, on dry down, this smells awful on me. It becomes a dirty, sweaty, stale scent. I have to layer it under other fragrances in order to tolerate it. I was honestly expecting I'd love this especially with the cactus and citrus notes but oof this is not for me.",01/27/22 12:48,Lulu Mermaid
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Blind Buy Win -

I actually really enjoy this. This is a perfect spring / summer scent, or whenever you want to smell ""fresh"". It's not your typical fresh scent though, it's quite unique in my opinion. It definitely leans more on the unisex / masculine side, due to the Red Cedar note but I actually really enjoy unisex / masculine scents on me.

It starts off with a blast of strong citrus, then quickly mellows out into a beautiful blend of soft citrus, vanilla, amber, and cedar. I don't pick up on the orchid, or the cactus blossom (not that I really know what that smells like). I'd call this a woodsy - vanilla.

I know a lot of people complain about the performance on this, but I'm actually quite impressed with it. I'm worn this several times and it lasts me all day with moderate projection. I'm currently wearing CK IN2U, and at 7 hours in I can still smell this quite prominently. I get wafts of it throughout the day, and I can still detect the fragrance on my skin.

Overall, a successful blind buy and $20 well spent.",01/19/22 11:18,LizaJane
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,If u want to transform this perfume into a sexy vanilla ambery lemonade. Layer with VS. Amber Romance!!,01/12/22 17:31,AbideinChrist
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I really noticed the cedar and bergamot notes, less so the vanilla and orchid. This is a unusual scent and not a safe blind buy. As opposed to what most reviewers are saying it has an evident woody pine, bergamot end point which leans masculine. I'm surprised this isn't considered a unisex fragrance or even a masculine one. Blind bought it before I checked the notes after hearing it described as fresh citrus vanilla - amber but I couldn't detect vanilla much at all.

That said, I understand why woodsy citrus turpine lovers would adore this fragrance.",01/12/22 06:33,luna k
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"If this fragrance had more lasting power I would be OBSESSED. I love it! I don't normally fall for fresh or citrus fragrances unless they're tropical (this is definitely NOT tropical lol), but omg there is just something about this. My description will do this absolutely no justice, but the best explanation I have is that this is a sweet, warm, Lemon Pledge scent lol. It doesn't smell like cleaning products, but I just don't know how else to explain it. It's fresh, comforting, sweet, a little warm, and just... idk. I love it. If they could figure out a way to make this last and have a little throw (it's definitely a skin scent, no sillage to be found) I would buy this in bulk. As it is, I use it like a body spray and drench myself and my clothes in it. Even so, after an hour or two I can only smell it if I lift my shirt or arm to my nose. Such a pity because this fragrance is delicious.",01/06/22 22:21,LolliMolly09

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Calvin Klein’s In2U for Her is THE OG, and the perfume I’ve owned the longest. This was, interestingly, a blind buy. A friend of a friend, having read my humble note on perfumes, recommended this perfume to me, and while I didn’t exactly have access to it from my humble hometown, I always kept that in mind. Two years later, I casually mentioned the name to the “not sure if he is my boyfriend” person in my life. And a few months down the line, when our families had already talked about us getting married and we decided to meet for the first time as potential partners, this was what he brought for me, and this was what I wore when I was falling deep, deep in love with him. Cheesy, yes? But hey, I was all of 24, and realising I had already met the man I was going to spend the rest of my life with was a heady feeling.

Each time I sniff this perfume, I immediately see me in a yellow top with thin straps – a fun, flirty girly piece I discarded from my wardrobe just a few months ago because it was worn to death. I had bought that top right before my fiance landed in Bangalore from Vietnam, when we took a trip with my sister and brother-in-law (who, by the way, are his college mates) to Pondicherry. It was the thick of summer, and our hotel room overlooked the rocky beach. This was the perfume that stayed with me when we went out for that lunch where he cut my pork ribs for me (such a sweetheart!), when we went to the beach to see the sunset and my brother-in-law took candid photos of us (still some of my favourite photos in the whole wide world) and even when we went to that serenely intimate French restaurant for our engagement party and I came back to the room slightly wobbly and lightheaded from all the wine.

CK In2U Her is summer in a bottle. It has the obvious citruses in the top, a very unusual cactus in the middle and the usual vanilla, cedar and amber in the base. CK perfumes unfortunately don’t have a very good reputation longevity and projection wise, and until recently I belonged to the group of people who dismissed any perfume that doesn’t last very long. What’s the point of wearing perfume if no one can smell it on you? But then I was initiated into the idea of – surprise, surprise – respraying. Groundbreaking stuff, I know. If I needed any more reason to love this perfume, it is extremely easy on the pockets, which is why you won’t even mind spraying it again, and again, and again. Oh, hello sunshine!

If you were to ask me to recommend one, just one perfume to you, I would probably say CK In2U Her. It’s such a crowd pleasing perfume. More than the smell, I think it encapsulates the essence of summer – the invigorating nip in the air after a bout of summer rain when you can smell the wet earth, the eye-blinding brightness of a white sheet drying in the sun, the sweet-sour thirst-quenching harmony of a tall glass of lemonade and for me, that of being young and in love and walking on the beach wearing flip-flops, holding the hand of the man I was falling in love with.",12/28/21 05:53,ssamhita

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Not a fan of this one, I initially really liked it but with time the smell got annoying. I am still new to perfumes but citrusy is not my thing. It barely stays and I finished the whole thing without anyone ever mentioning the smell. Either they weren't a fan or they just couldn't smell it.",12/03/21 10:24,beforesunset_mj
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"Citrusy and spicy with depth at the opening and it gets a little bit sweeter as it dries down. I personally find it works equally in every weather and season. It lasts 4 to 5 hours, but it becomes a skin scent after 3 to 4 hours. Perfectly unisex though leaning on the feminine side as it dries.
I wouldn't be able to pick any separate note except for the grapefruit. However, I certainly think it has that CK DNA.
It smells more expensive than the retail price for sure as it has it's own personality.",11/24/21 12:55,li_day
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"At first, I did not care much for this. If you are familiar with Calvin Klein's Eternity Summer scents, then smell this, you'll recognize the DNA. I adore light, bright, citrusy scents and light watery florals. This in comparison to my Guess Dare, CKin2U leans more unisex.",11/24/21 10:00,AMGMoonHalo
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"The opening is very citrusy/springy/bright and while I didn't hate it, I also didn't love it. The dry down though, I love! It deepens, get a bit sweeter, but still with that bit of citrus. This is a very nice, clean smell without being soapy or laundry-like. I think it would be great for the office. My only issue is that while the opening is a bit bright and loud, it VERY quickly fades to skin only. I can't even really smell it on myself unless I huff my clothes or wrist. I'll have to treat this more like a body spray than a perfume, which I don't mind for the price.",11/22/21 22:31,LolliMolly09
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I came across this perfume on a YouTube video where Ksenja gushed about her love for this perfume . Boy was she right !!! It smells fresh yet sexy , citrusy yet sultry . It smells expensive yet $20 at tj maxx ? Score !!! It’s definitely a sprint / summer scent but I have to admit, I may wear it this winter because I love it THAT much . My husband is not one to love all of my perfumes because of how sugary sweet I like them but he really liked this one ! ( it’s not sugary sweet ).",11/17/21 17:27,Aglopez09
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I agree with the comment below. I read and heard so many positive things about this and the notes looked promising. I picked up a 3.4 oz at Marshall’s on a blind buy for $20 or so.

However the dry down is odd to me. It is strangely stale and masculine. I am not overly feminine with my perfume tastes and can handle unisex fragrances, but the dry down smells like a cheap men’s cologne in its final appearance before disappearing completely.

Maybe it’s the cedar?

Edit: I just tried the CK Gold and it smells like the MUCH better version of this.",11/17/21 15:59,victoriabarretta
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I blind bought this as a YouTube recommendation for summer. The opening is wow, fresh citrus, perfect. Then within seconds, the dry down begins and I begin to dislike this more and more. It took me a while to work out what this smelt like, but I get a few things. I used to spend every working day wearing latex gloves and that powdery latex is what the drydown reminds me of. I also get a smoker covering up their smoking with gum from this and a log cabin in a pine forest. I think this perfume is more autumn for me, it's got a lot of warmth to it despite the fresh citrusy opening. Needless to say, this isn't for me but it doesn't mean it's not for you. A lot of people love this one. It's now found a new home!",11/17/21 13:17,qofb

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"I really wanted to like this. On paper it ticks all the boxes, juicy fresh citrus, the typical unisex quality of ck fragrances, and a dry down into vanilla and amber to make it more feminine. What could possibly go wrong? It opens with a very in-my-face, rather masculine citrus scent, then quickly turns into nothing much on my skin. A faint cologne smell lingers, but doesn’t excite me either. What a shame.",11/12/21 05:38,Seldarius

CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"This is a lovely fragrance with an unusual note that I assume is the cactus since it outlasts the opening grapefruit and citrus.

Now sadly it doesn't last very long, perhaps 3 hours, so I have been been looking for something similar with more longevity. FCUK Late Night is definitely not it, as it is missing the lovely cactus smell.",10/27/21 08:09,darkwitch
CK IN2U for Her Calvin Klein,"What can I say? I love it. It's a beautiful perfume for very little money....and that's my favorite kind!! I first heard of this from Ksenja's YouTube channel and she highly recommended it. I was still wary because my taste isn't the same as hers but I figured in would try it anyway because it was less than $20 for a huge bottle. Another $2 would have gotten me double the size but I didn't want that massive thing in my collection and I still wasn't sure what it smelled like but OMG it was love at first sniff for me and I'll never be without it again. It's fresh and zesty but there's a sweetness to it at the same time that is very addicting. I can't stop smelling my wrist when I spray this. Overspraying is required w this one but that shouldn't be an issue considering the price point. This could be worn in the Fall, Spring and Summer but not in the Winter. It's a pleasant day time fragrance that is an easy reach. Perfect for the gym, running errands or staying at home....a major win in my collection.",10/21/21 11:53,Thegrimmreaderr

Surprisingly nice performance with my bottle, 5 solid hours! May not sound great, but 5 hours.. I mean, that's pretty long, and just when you think it's a skin scent, you get a whiff and realize its projecting still.

I think this is an all ages fragrance, its simply up to your interpretation. It's worth your money, if you don't like it, your out $20 MAX, give it a go!

also I can't help but defend the bottle design, the neon green spray-paint, yeah I mean.. it's different but I think it's kind of nice looking, especially in a collection.",11/08/25 22:21,literallyrickgrimes
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"It does resemble a sweet pipe tobacco but only when it's moist and unburned in the container, not while being smoked. And then not for long.

But if you want something that REALLY smells like pipe tobacco (perhaps a little too much) try ""Pipe Tobacco"" by Demeter. Not subtle, it's like getting hit over the head with a tub of Captain Black. Alas, I like getting hit over the head with a tub of Captain Black.

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"I finally let my curiosity get the best of me and I bought a bottle of this after years of hearing what a solid cheapie it is. I must say I totally agree. Shock is a tremendously likeable tobacco-centric scent that's more than worth the modest price of admission. The tobacco here is genially sweet and nicely paired with some fresh aromatic notes and a noticeable amount of lavender in the dry down. It's warm, masculine, and inviting with a nice blend of tobacco, amber, spice, sweetness, and fresh fruit & floral notes. Performance is pretty average, not terrible and certainly acceptable at the $20 price point I paid for a 100ml bottle. The dry down reminds me vaguely of several other colognes without being an imitation of any of them. Burberry Brit might be the closest, though I prefer Shock thanks to it's more prominent tobacco (and Brit always smells like shaving foam to me). It also reminds me a little of the OG Spicebomb, and I can't help thinking that Shock might be what you'd get if you added some tobacco to the OG Le Male with its shared lavender base. Anyway, it's funny how odd the bottle design is for this scent: why CK thought ""let's splatter the word 'Shock' in a dayglo green graffiti font"" to market this cozy tobacco scent is beyond me. But a solid scent it is bad bottle and all. If you're curious like I was, I say go for it.",11/04/25 20:17,doggymcnuggets

Otherwise save your money and put it with the other money you’d be spending on a cheapie to replace this one when you realize that this lasts about two hours and then it’s gone and buy a better one. It’s not bad, the scent is pleasant but you have to do like 20 sprays to get anything out of it.",10/03/25 17:25,Acathar
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"A surprisingly well-rounded fragrance for the price. The opening brings a sweet, slightly earthy tobacco that's warm and smooth. This is paired with an ambery base that feels cozy and inviting.

There’s a sticky, syrupy sweetness, but it avoids being overly dense or cloying. I get faint hints of licorice and violet, which add a soft nuance, but for people who don't like licorice it's not that strong here. Despite the tobacco/amber core, there’s also a subtle clean, woody-aromatic undertone that keeps it from feeling too heavy.

On my skin, I don’t pick up much spice, but I would assume that would only make the tobacco more lively and possibly give it a little bit of smokiness.

Overall, CK One Shock is one of those excellent entry-level amber-tobacco fragrances—warm, approachable, and versatile in cooler weather. A inexpensive pick for someone just getting into deeper, slightly darker scents.",10/03/25 04:51,foolishdonnie

You know what? This fragrance isn't that bad. I gave it another chance one day, and this is what I experienced.
The opening is still fucking ass, just like my old review explained, but the drydown actually isn't the worst thing in the world. It reminds me of tobacco and coke mixed together, very interesting and good in its own way.
Completely disregarding the old review I made, this fragrance is really special for being ass until it's not. But the opening weighs this down enough for me to say that it's just ok

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"I'm so old I remember ads for this fragrance on TV back in 2011! If Dr Pepper sold pouches of cherry tobacco for rolled up cigarettes it would smell like this!

People compare this to smelling like an energy drink. I never pictured that before but it definitely could remind you of a fresh can of red bull just opened perhaps but the tobacco gives it more quality and hides the sweetness well.

The tacky green spray paint art font gives it a youthful impression but any guy can wear this. Great for cold weather mornings especially. I've seen 200ml on deals for 25 euro! Insane value! Maybe it's not the longest lasting but it's not terrible, average for an edt, smells really nice.",08/30/25 13:56,ashroloie

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Can't remember if I reviewed this previously but this is one of my favorites for winter and fall. I have a cost with fur around the hood. I always spray it down with CK Shock in the winter. It's a signature scent when I wear that coat.

It's so so SO so good. I didn't know what to expect the first time I purchased it. The bottle is terrible and looks nothing like the fragrance smells. The bottle will have you thinking you are about to buy a damn monster drink. But the juice is exquisite.

It's kinda sweet but the tobacco in this isn't as serious and stern as it is in a lot of fragrance. The tobacco is really chill and sanguine. Very laid back and hedonistic.

Btw I almost always layer this with Cremos Spice & Black Vanilla. Major compliment puller. They cut through winter air delightfully together. If you're on the fence, just get it. For the price there are very few in its league. It doesn't smell cheap, the atomizer gives a very generous amount of juice each spray. It's long lasting. It's sexy. Very sexy. 9/10

Deducted a point because of the bottle",07/25/25 23:58,The AntiChrist
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Honestly, CK One Shock is way better than I expected for the price. The first spray hits you with a sweet, almost citrusy redbull vibe with a little spice from cardamom and lavender. It’s solid, but not over the top in terms of intensity.

As it settles, that warm, sweet cherry pipe tobacco kicks in and really gives it an balanced edge. The dry down is smooth It feels warm, a little sexy, and honestly kind of addictive makes you want to lean in again to catch a whiff.

It doesn’t last all day maybe 4 to 7 hours max on me but for a cheaper scent it has a banger status in my opinion. I rate it 8/10 will buy the 200 ml again.",07/23/25 04:37,Yourperfumebuddy
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Pretty good choice for people who don't care about fragrance too deeply and just want something cheap that's reasonably well done and easy to like.

This is a slightly gourmandy (but not terribly sweet) tobacco in a similar area as something like Burberry London or D&G The One, with an amber-woody base, but it's a step less complex than either of those already quite straightforward scents. The upside is that for me CK One Shock seems to have better performance than either of them.

The combination of sweet + simple makes this feel appropriate for young guys, a teenager could surely wear it too. If you want to underline sophistication or authority through your perfume, look elsewhere.

The contrast between the terrible branding and the scent itself is funny, though still not as silly as Philipp Plein No Limits.",07/05/25 03:05,coal17

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Absolutely love it! For around 20€ for 100ml this is great buy. Opens up like sour, medicinal cherry, but startes fading in to milky vanilla, tobacco and powdery musk.

Definitely for younger crowd, I wish I started with fragrances in my early high school days (not at end of high school like i did) my high school experience would be much better and this fragrance would definitely be my pick, great for high school parties and dates. I live in mediterranean climate and this is for winter, autumn, spring day and night and cooler summer nights. I love this bottle and box design soo nostalgic to me like drinking energy drink before going to party. Longevity is solid on my skin probably around 6 hours, projection also solid, but don't be afraid to use 4 or more sprays.

This is a masculine fragrance ... PERIOD. If you're the kind of guy that likes John Varvatos Vintage, Bentley Absolute ... or even the original Bentley for Men .... then you probably will like this. The funny thing is because of the weird and ""youthful"" presentation and marketing ... well, I kept saying NO. Luckily a friend who is in his late 50s was wearing this ...

To me it smells like cinnamon more than anything. I don't feel tobacco. Cinnamon, amber, cardamom, a little bit of pepper - those are dominant notes. Smells like Christmas.

I have two other similar fragrances: Yohji Yamamoto I'm Not Going to Disturb You Pour Homme and 1986 Eclectique Les Bains Guerbois. They all go in the same direction, but Shock for Him is noticably the most synthetic and weak of them. In 15 minutes it's a skin scent on me...

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Absurdously disgustingly cheap bottle for the great fragrance it got inside. I have never seen this thing being advertised anywhere and I cannot help, but blaming Calvin Klein for ruining themselves by poor captaining of their own company.
Guys, I see some of you being overzealous for a thingy, that's around 20$. I mean let's be honest choice of women won't be the best for you if you can only afford 20$ to spend on a date. Same goes along other stuff in life.
The scent of this bottle (I won't call a perfume intentionally) is one of the best you can get in this price range. Why? Because it is a definitely good designer blend, which we rarely find in arabic dupes. There are designer companies out there, which could have easily sold this for thrice this price and half the volume (like D&G, Valentino, etc.) and you would have appreciated it just because you are a fanboy or biased. Now, I gotta say, that Calvin Klein sells the best designer fragrances at a very reasonable cost to this day and 20$ for a 200ml juice of this kind is like a one great 'welcome home' from a lady for your cheap ass.
Depending on your local climate and weather factors, you can easily abuse this even in the summer, when it is windy. It is intoxicatingly fresh and beats the entire Calvin Klein Eternity line imho.
There is something I noticed the chemistry of my body does with this fragrance, altering it to something very mature, masculine and appealing to women, once I return from my daily running exercise. I have made it a ritual to always buy me a can of beer after that, so women on the queue in the store would start staring at me and approaching me to get a sniff or two. Just for a comparison almost every other sweet perfume I have, would turn to something like a sweetened vinegar and pickles, so good job here CK.",05/08/25 13:08,sic_transit_gloria_mundi

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"I loved Dark Obsession and was over the moon when I learned that CK Shock is basically that except with fruity notes instead I believe a more chocolately or some kind of darker/rich top note. I was worried it would be too fruity or sweet. I got the bottle the other day for a great price ($26 for 6.7oz I believe). The minute I opened it I was in love. It was sweeter than I remember, but not overwhelmingly cloying. After inserting the sprayer, I went into the kitchen (I have a 3000+ sq ft house). This scent, not having sprayed it or anything yet, was filling the living room, kitchen, and first bathroom within 5 minutes. I didn't realize it at first until I was like, ""What is that beautiful smell? Ohhh the Shock!"" Just having the cap laying around, I kept smelling it and smelling it.

Despite the potency, it was not overwhelming and was quite pleasant. Whenever the bottle is near me, I get little wafts of it. It is so intoxicating, so beautiful. I love it on my boyfriend. I am tempted to wear it myself around the house I love it so much. I am not sure about projection or sillage yet on the skin, but I get little currents of smell of it from my boyfriend when he's wearing it. I did notice it seems to mellow out relatively shortly (within 3-4 hours) on skin. But you get so much of it for a good price that I think having to reapply is worth it. I also think the new fruity note puts it right on the edge of almost being too sweet but it toes that line well. I am guessing Shock is CK's way of trying to compete with Axe and other body sprays, which is why it is marketed towards younger men. But I think if you don't want to smell like a barbershop or a blue/sport fragrance all the time, this is a good alternative. Would be great for date night, too.",03/06/25 14:20,cmjdt

It's the same kind of fragrance as Fuel for Life by Diesel; for the young crowd that want to be seen and heard by their peers. For me, it's fun to wear for a little bit but dulls out as it does not progress beyond its initial smell.",03/04/25 12:46,hvnscnt
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Gonna come back and write a follow up but first impressions are a miss with me.

I smell all the notes and the ""energy drink"" sweetness but to me it has a head that smells like incense and dries down to a powdery musky incense. Reminds me of walking into a spencers in the 2000s and smelling that incense smell.

Can smell the spicy/tobacco/pepper but its just overwhelmed by whatever the musk/incense note is.

Wouldnt even say its a masculine smell either smells unisex/more male at best. I heard calvin klein has been making their ""for him"" scents more unisex lately and this one seemingly falls into that category.",02/24/25 20:33,ChettRipley686

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"The opening is just how I remember it from years ago...energy drink. It's synthetic in a sweet and addictive way...that orange (or whatever citrus) with the cucumber and herbs converge in a way that just reminds me distinctly of energy drinks. The neon green wording against a black bottle doesn't help either 😆 I love it.

It dries down quickly, and it's adorable in it's casual-ness. When I first encountered this one, I was younger, and less jaded. Nostalgia is all over this review, and I'm sorry, but it's a fragrance more for the heart than for a refined palate.

Still, this isn't objectively a bad fragrance at all. No, it's nothing particularly special (it's a little like Jazz Club or The One, but less rich and dense), but it's a profile I tend to absolutely fall for. Maybe, in some way, I love the other tobacco spices because this one left an impression on me as a young woman. Hard to know exactly, I have a type though.

I nagged my husband into buying this (it's fine, he loves it too), and it's drying down in a lovely way on him. It's ambery, inviting, unpretentious, simple, but it's such a true feel-good fragrance. If he didn't want to wear this, I just would myself to experience it. It's a bit more masculine, with it being herbaceous the way it is, but not terribly so (many warm-leaning fragrances are fairly unisex to my nose, men's or women's, but who cares, wear what you love).

Glad to have a bottle of this in the house finally. CK is one of my favorite brands, I must concede. Simple, effective stuff that tends to evoke nostalgia. Extremely easy to wear, but often...not boring. Shock is a love.",12/21/24 21:17,ShadowsofLight
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Been contemplating this one for a while. Finally got a bottle. This is a different take on the discontinued CK Dark Obsession. It seems they simply removed the floral note from CKDO and replaced it with a fruity note for CK Shock.

This would be a good substitute if you enjoyed CK Dark Obsession but find it overpriced now or difficult to find. Longevity is about the same for both.

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"I find it very strange that the same perfumer who created some of the most obnoxiously loud fragrances known to man -- a good number of the AXE Body Spray fragrances -- created a great smelling tobacco fragrance that has hardly any projection after 30 minutes, and virtually disappears after a few hours. You would think that with a proper perfume/cologne being sold at this price point, the projection would be monstrous and the durability would be eternal, given who made it. This is bizarre to me.",11/22/24 20:53,Stephen N

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"This was my first tobacco fragrance I bought and still it remains the best tobacco fragrance I smelled - in terms of smell.
The smell is really good, tobacco in there is soft, sweet, and balanced. There is nothing harsh, syntetic or disturbing. Smell does not change during the drydown too much, it is pretty stable. It is a masculine scent, but not too much, that means it fits younger guys too. Besides the tobacco, cardamon could be smelled, then amber and patchouli. I do not get the mandarin nor cucumber... I like the smell really much, and everybody I asked loved it too. Drawback is the longevity and projection. It lasts for about 4-5 hours and projection is moderate. I recommend to re-spray it after 4 hours, because after that it is a skin scent only. Price is nevertheless amazing, you will not buy better tobacco fragrance for this price. It smells better than spicebomb extreme, belive me. It is verry underrated fragrance, that deserves your attention. Do not be affraid about tobacco, it is pleasant for women in this version, it is manly but still confortable to wear by anybody. Wear it during the fall or winter, day or night, is suitable for date or to office. It will surprise you after the first spray, how good it is. Enjoy!",11/20/24 08:19,FRAGfanSK
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"If you're over the age of 16, I wouldn't recommend this one.
I got half a bottle of this as a gift and every time I tried to give it a chance, I ended up hating it more. Maybe it's the cucumber in the opening combined with the tobacco base note, but it just has a sickly smell to it. The longevity is definitely good though, I sprayed some in the kitchen after cleaning up the bottle a bit and I would smell it every time I entered the room for the next 3 days (and regret spraying it).
Something about it just screams immature and trashy to me. The first fragrance of an inexperienced teenager.
Even if you're looking for a cheap starter fragrance, there's much better options. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one.",11/20/24 06:59,03
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Opening, like another user mentioned, smells like Dr. Pepper, the tobacco is front and center rounding things out, and the drydown smells like a less intense Joop!

Thank the fragrance Gods that Calvin Klein stuck this in an absurd and Ill-fitting bottle, put it in the CK One line, and put no promotion behind it because otherwise it would still be to this day 3-4x the price, and people would totally pay it. Starts out smelling like Dr. pepper meets Red Bull then settles down into a strangely fresh and energetic warm spicy ambery sweet Tobacco. Truly unique and alluring, masculine yet sweet, warm yet a bit youthful. Pretty versatile in the fall and winter. You could wear this day or night, to work/school, on a date, or just hanging out. Nothing too dressy or formal though. If youre not sure about tobacco, I assure you this is non intimidating, easy to wear and mass pleasing in a very good way.

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Pleasantly surprised by this one! I love a spicy warm scent- and my favorite is Spicebomb. And anyone that says they are the same is nose-blind. I can see some similarities, but that's like calling folders and nesspresso the same thing! But this is pretty darn good for the price point- and it delivers on the warm spicy. The bottle betrays the scent- as they don't really connect at all. It looks like it's gonna be a sassy loud sport scent. I get a lot of sweetness at first- and surprised I don't see Cinnamon as an intentional note. It mellows out well and lasts longer than I was expecting. I have been trying this side by side with Dirty English- and I will say it holds up MUCH better after a couple hours. At this price- I'll be keeping it in the collection and rotation for days I don't want to put on the expensive stuff!

It's a good scent for today's weather (a rainy day in the fall). As other reviews said, the smell is complicated. Although the opening is a little harsh to me, the dry down is not a simple smell. I agree with others that this one probably does not need to be included in the CK One line; it absolutely can be itself. I got it 6.8oz for around $30, which is worth a blind buy to me.

It suits the younger crowd best I think.
I tried this quite a few years ago and it was different to what I remember, I actually enjoyed it when I tried it before. Maybe they took out some ingredients. I get no top notes at all. And it's a genuine bottle from a retailer. I can't imagine anyone faking this scent.",10/22/24 11:04,Sniff away

The tobacco in both are similar, but Shock is a zesty burst somehow warm and masculine all at once. The notes listed in top notes I don't really understand because I pick up zero cucumber among others but who cares. You just need to try it. $20 for 100 ml, $30 for 200 ml. Love this! It is a sleeper. Not gourmand but sweet. Very masculine and great tobacco note. It's very versatile and cheap. It hangs close to the skin but spray more on! It's cheap!

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"This is all over the place with its notes. I smell a ton of things. At first spray it's strong . It's an aroma bomb and is giving hints that it's a beast mode long lasting fragrance ( it's not). So as I had heard it does smell like cherry cough syrup . With a little spice and pungent rubber. After about a minute or 2 it starts smelling a lot like a fall cinnamon candle. The sweet tobacco in this to me smells a lot like cinnamon. At this stage it smells a lot like a fall spices candle. Like walking through the fall aisle in a store. At this point I think it's ok but I don't know if it's something I want to smell like. It's still pretty strong . Once it has been on the skin and hits its final form which is about 15 to 20 minutes later it really mellows out and becomes way easier on the nose. It's like a spiced tobacco cinnamon syrup . It stays close to the skin but it's definitely there. It projects strong for about an hour. And becomes a close but strong skin scent after that. The sillage is not bad at all. It will be a close skin scent at about
2 hours and will fade away by the 4th hour. It's not that horrible performance wise but on the first whiff you assume this thing is gonna be nuclear for hours.
It is definitely a fall and winter fragrances. It will work day and night . But it will be more for the evening for me. I also see myself wearing this more when I go out with friends. Don't think I would wear this on date night and probably not work. It is very masculine smelling. Anyone that tries this out don't just spray it on and wash it off of you don't like it. It totally has stages and the end result is quite nice. I wish this were less spiced to let more of a natural tobacco note shine. It smells too much like cinnamon to me. Overall I can see why CK One Shock is liked by many and I can see why many will think it smells nasty. I give this a 6/10 . I'll update this score once we hit the end of fall. I just hope the performance improves but I kinda doubt it will.",10/03/24 14:27,WildCalifornia

I kind of like the bottle actually, it's very smooth and the etching on the bottle is fun to run my fingers over. I also like the font. The marketing is poor, and it should not have been part of the ck one line. Completely different scent profile.

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"In certain parts of India, people used to let cow dung dry up and then eventually the cakes, known as 'upla/kanda'(Hindi) were used for cooking because that's how expensive and inaccessible gas was. I have vivid memories of this because I grew up in central India where this was a common practice, especially at my grandmother's, which was like a second home for me.

I keep reading about how every second oud gets called 'barnyard/animalic' on this site and always think that's an exaggeration. This right here, smells exactly like the cow dung cakes we used to use. I say this as someone who comes from a place where we used to have cows in most homes and worshipped them.

As the religion based politics made the place unliveable for someone like me, and now that I have now spent a good 16 years running away from it, this scent managed to remind me of those nights where we'd all sit on the terrace as power was cut, and make something called 'gakkad bharta'(probably the best Indian dish you haven't heard of) on these cow dung cakes. Nostalgic but not something I'd want to smell like and I love nothing more than a good tobacco perfume.

In short, this smells like dried cow dung.",08/13/24 14:31,Slowpainhauer

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"* Attractive hybrid tobacco/aromatic fougere/amber cologne

* Appealing blend of sweet, tobacco, amber spice, musk, herbal and powder aromas
* Great entry level tobacco fragrance
* Actually works well in high heat despite the tobacco base

* Very little effort in presentation
* Should have been separated out from the CK line
* Not unisex
* Not suitable for younger users despite being in a line specifically designed and marketed for younger users

Calvin Klein CK One Shock for Him is an original fragrance from Calvin Klein, a flanker in the popular and very prolific CK line which include CK One, CK Be, CK All, CK Everyone and the multitude of flankers each of these spinoffs has generated. They're all very high quality, affordable and distinguished by the famous ""drinking flask"" bottle.

CK One Shock for Him is definitely one of the better ones in the line. It's a hybrid cologne that mixes tobacco, aromatic fougere and amber style fragrances into a single very attractive mix. Sweet, tobacco, amber spice, musk, herbal and powder aromas come together seamlessly This is very much the illicit love child of Calvin Klein's own famous fougere classic Eterntiy and your favorite tobacco fragrance (think Mancera Red Tobacco or A*Men Pure Havane, for example). That freshness actually makes this work well even in high heat, which is very rare for a tobacco forward fragrance.

This is a great entry level tobacco fragrance for users. However, it still very much leans older due to those tobacco notes and is not suitable for younger users. This makes its inclusion into the CK line as a flanker all the more puzzling to me, as the rest of the entire CK line emphasizes fresh youthful fragrances and are marketed towards younger users. This really should have IMHO been its own separate product away from the CK line and marketed towards older users and deserved a better presentation than the CK bottle. I'm also puzzled by the decision to separate the atomizer from the bottle, as you have to attach it yourself and once you do the cap no longer fits on the bottle. The only other fragrance I have that does this is Paco Rabanne Pour Homme and it's also just as annoying that they did that.

Performance is just okay and I would recommend overspraying on first application and occasionally respraying throughout the day. This is common of the CK line, though. This is overall a reasonably good quality fragrance at a reasonably good price. Recommended.",07/17/24 12:44,Bronstet
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"I picked up a 100ml bottle at Burlington for about $18 3 years ago. I'm not sure if the price has increased since then, but even if it has, I'd say $25 to $20 range for 100ml is still worth the purchase!

CK One Shock is a great entry level tobacco note frag. I would definitely recommend it to someone who is new to fragrances and is just trying to figure out what they like.

I use this just for daytime casual wear when I'm running errands or going to work. During the fall and winter, I may wear this once or twice a month when I get the itch to spray it.

I'd say I typically get 6 to 8 hours of performance. Which, for a fragrance in this price range is great. However, In order to get to that 8 hour mark, you'll definitely need at least 6-8 sprays. Half of those sprays would need to be on your shirt/clothes.

I get a decent sillage for the first hour, and an arms length of projection for two hours tops.

If you're hunting for compliments, I'm not sure if this will garner many simply because someone may need to be close to you in order to smell it.

For the price point, it's a great value. Overall, CK One Shock is a candidate to be up there with Nautica Voyage on the Cheapie Mt. Rushmore of fragrances.",07/16/24 15:41,EbagAppez

I recently purchased CK One Shock For Him by Calvin Klein. While the scent itself is pleasant and sophisticated, I unfortunately experienced headaches every time I applied it. This is quite disappointing, as I was looking forward to enjoying this fragrance. It might be due to sensitivity to one of the ingredients, which is something potential buyers should be aware of. I hope Calvin Klein considers reviewing the formulation to make it more suitable for individuals with sensitivities.",07/06/24 09:54,AbiNissanka

What a nice tobacco fragrance... Very masculine and clean smelling as it is freshly dried tobacco leaves with spices.

In my opinion, this can be used at all times, as it is a very agreeable scent. Durability? Who cares! This is so affordable that you can reapply whenever you feel the need for that superb tobacco that tingles the nose.

A cheap, or rather one should say an inexpensive, cuddly scent especially in the mids. Half way through the dry down it becomes a very nice/safe scent. The opening is a bit on the cheap side, but that is only the first 15-30 minutes. If you're thinking this is close to Mancera Red Tobacco, or something gourmand like a TF Tobacco Venille, well, it's not. It is a designer style cologne that shines nicely half way in its dry down.",06/07/24 05:30,Nosey_Sniffington

The scent has tobacco smoky and a little herbal kind of scent to it. Also it is quite chemically and smells a little like my church in the good way. The longevity and sillage are weak to moderate. The bottle is very weird and doesn’t come with a cap that is really accessible. Overall I would not buy this again but it does smell very good.

I also hate the capless bottle design which means you can't bring it on the go without it going off in your bag. To me it's a very warm, citrussy fragrance that lasts for about 30 minutes with the citrus being way too overpowering for the first 5 minutes and then being gone completely.

The bottle is ugly, the performance (on skin) is mid af, but its a cheap tobacco scent that is unique. A guilty pleasure of mine",03/06/24 16:05,c0lemanscents13

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"CK One Shock by Calvin Klein:
This is a warm and spicy yet sweet woody fragrance with a big focus on tobacco, with that particular note being done well. It’s a great pickup for the price and a semi-safe blind buy. Good for those colder months with fairly average performance.

Top notes: Pepper, basil, tobacco, some cinnamon
Middle notes: Cardamom, lavender, osmanthus
Base notes: Tobacco, patchouli, wood

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"This reminds me of The One by D&G EDP, they aren't the same but both share 50% of the same scent profile/type... I bought this blindly 2 years ago and it shocked me because I expected it to be generic fresh CK style or max a simple cologne like an aftershave quality(it was $25 200ml), but surprisingly found it very nice, sweet Tobacco yet balanced, fresh and aromatic.. manly and rich in the dry-down after 10 minutes!... I like the alcoholic blast in the opening (people complaining about it saying it's synthetic) I like it, it disappears quickly and it's very refreshing, especially after showering 💚

I disagree with reviews talking about the weak performance... personally this last 8+ hours on me plus 90 minutes to 2 hours of nice decent projection... the more time passes it smells better and better and becomes more natural on the skin.

This fragrance is not less in beauty than The one by D&G ... it fills the same gap and serves perfectly on the same occasions... and honestly the Tobacco here especially when it settled is way better, richer and more prominent than The one...

I recommend this, young men would love it, and it's a great entrance to the mature type of fragrances ... seriously it's way better than many expensive fragrances... test it, if you like it get the 200 ml it is worth it... good deal👌 you won't regret it.",02/13/24 02:22,BASMAJ
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Yes, it has the Burberry London vibe, but without the prominent cinnamon note. That's why London smells more delcious.
Shock is more energetic, wilder, spicier. London is all about cosy dinner time.

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"CK Shock Is a beautiful warm and sexy spicy fragrance with that CK sweet and playful DNA. To my nose Shock opens with that sweet clementine and lavender, you get a lovely cardamom, strong pepper and basil but blended nicely with that Apricot smelling osmanthus, the base and the mid work together as the warmth and dryness of the amber and tobacco combine to make this fragrance sexy and ideal for intimate situations, musky...for sure, earthy too! CK Shock does not smell cheap by any means it's beautiful but yes it's a CK fragrance in the end... I adore the bottle with the writing Shock and screwing on the cap gives it more of a personal feel, for the price this is gorgeous and go ahead and spray 20 times because you probably won't reach the 4th hour mark of longevity as soon as you apply this one it starts to sit closer to the skin. I love applying this before bed it's so nice and uplifting If this fragrance was beastmode I'd have to give it an 8 possibly 9/10, but it's not so I'll give it a 6.5 😁

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Based on the insanely good price of $30/200ml, this is amazing stuff.

Mainly cinnamon and tobacco, with some general sweetness and warm spice mixed in.

I do get a little bit of the lavender and orangey notes in the opening but they fade to the background quite quickly on my skin (like 5 minutes).

Honestly, if you want something that’s sweet but maintains its maturity, this is a fantastic 3/4 year fragrance to me. It’s an easy dumb reach because it smells nice and it’s cheap. Smells much lighter and even a bit woodsy and almost a little fresh in the air but as you get closer to skin it gets so nice and warm and sweet with the cardamom mixing in.

Genuinely ver appealing perfumery and for the price it’s just absolutely incredible.

A lot of these disgruntled reviews seem to have pretty unrealistic expectations of this perfume at this price point. Not sure what you guys are expecting- for $30/200ml, this is incredible stuff. I’d even be happy if it was $30/100 but any higher would be a bit crazy for me.

Decent longevity, okay projection, but scent profile alone is enough to keep me coming back. 100% worth trying if you’re thinking about it.",01/19/24 19:55,LePianoMan

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"A Chic Blend for Warm Weather: CK One Shock! For Him

Rating: ★★★☆☆

As a fan of almost all CK fragrances, I find them to be beautifully crafted and well-made. The company has a distinct personality that shines through in its products, which are never weak or hit-and-miss. They always adhere to a strict set of rules before a release, ensuring quality and consistency.

CK One Shock! For Him is no exception. It’s a prestigious amber/Smocky fragrance perfect for warm weather. The composition is beautiful, slightly sweet, warm, and undeniably chic. It can be compared to Spicebomb Extreme, although the latter is a bit more mass-appealing and longer-lasting.

Like most CK fragrances, don’t expect too much from its performance. However, the price justifies it. In the US, CK perfumes may be less appealing due to overuse and ubiquity, causing them to lose their appeal. But in far-off countries like ours, people can easily enjoy the art of these fragrances without the hype factor.",01/04/24 08:27,Karenhandmade.com

Sticks to clothes and stuff for a while. It is a pleasant tobacco cozy smell but can be very cloying and induce headaches. Good for colder days and should not be over sprayed.

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"I was looking for a winter fragrance and found this as a recommendation. Found it fairly cheap so I went ahead and ordered it. At first I couldn't stand it. It was as advertised a shock for my nose. Too sweet too sharp too much. But as it slowly dries down it becomes more and more pleasant. When I smell this I'm thinking of snow, knitted sweaters , Christmas vibe , Christmas herbs and spices. Shortly it's a very wintery / christmasy scent for me. Is a bit too sweet for me but it isn't bad. Some compared this to lattafas Asad but I can't really see any similarities as such.
I'm not saying there not similar , it's just that me personally can't connect those two.

I don't think I would buy it again but that's just because I believe that this scent was made for younger people and not old farts like me... Well middleaged farts like me anyway. I'd prefer something a bit less sweet But that's just my two cents.",12/03/23 19:08,Glassmoon
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"A nice cheap, but well done, pipe tobacco scent with amber, patchouli, and spice. Some basil and slight cocoa. Its biggest negative is how weak it is. Weak projection and poor longevity. That graffiti logo is awful and the name doesn’t fit at all. I usually turn the atomizer around and display the back of the bottle. Still if you can find it cheap, it’s a nice addition to your collection. The dry down, though somewhat faint, is wonderful. This one will stay on your clothes a decent amount of time, but at least on my skin, it doesn’t last long.",11/30/23 18:53,AJPkayla

Overall I think that I like the scent but not a love for me, although I like tobacco note in fragrances, but here it has more sweetness than I love.

It's definitely a younger persons scent. If the description sounds good to you totally go for it. It's usually under $30 if you can find it. Just be careful you will most likely have some stray pumpkin spice girls following you around.",11/14/23 00:15,Woodenkey
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"This is by far the best value for money fragrance that I own. I've seen it garner hype in the community in the past but I never pulled the trigger. That was until the discounter that I use in the UK came out with a ridiculous deal which I couldn't refuse. In the end I managed to pick up 200ml for £6 and it has got to be one of the best buys I've made since I started collecting fragrances.

The scent itself is a masculine, sweet tobacco which is phenomenally sexy in the cooler months. It has a sweet almost herbal undertone which is mass appealing and seductive.

Performance is also much better than expected as lasts about 5/6hrs and projects well for the first hour or so and then sits a lot closer. I would recommend spraying this on clothing to make the scent last even longer.

The presentation was unlike anything I've had before but I like the screw top on the bottle and the separate atomizer. It distributes a lot of fragrance and I really like how rustic it is. The bottle style aswell is a bit hit or miss but even a massive 200ml bottle doesn't look out of place with the rest of my bottles and I love the style of it.

All things said it is the best value for money fragrance that I own and it has been one that the ladies love. Would definitely recommend even if it was £30/40 an excellent fragrance.",11/10/23 04:33,Spadz97
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Scent-wise, this is one of the most quintessential fall fragrances I've ever smelled.

Thinking of this as a halloweeny scent can almost excuse the gaudy packaging too (almost). This is so cheap and pleasant it's a must-have, too bad the performance is dreadful. It also does not have a cap, which is bad for a poor-performing fragrance as you'd have to take it around with you to respray and wouldn't want it spurting about in your bag or glovebox.

Very smooth, not as sweet and sticky as I was expecting. It sure would be easy to pull this off as a signature scent year-round, especially since it'll get you a bubble that is off the radar amongst your typical freshie.
On the cheap, quite surprising quality, though very moderate performance ~3h apparent on my skin, then on the 3rd+ hour gets mild and smells of clean skin (soapy).
I dislike the bottling, but love the idea of having a screw on cap/atomizer.",11/03/23 10:43,frankcoelho
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Packaging is a bit silly and juvenile. The bright neon SHOCK is just not for me. Atomizer is ok, nothing special.
The opening is all sweet, warm tobacco and an undercurrent of spiciness. I'm not really getting any of the clementine or cucumber some other folks smell off the top. Maybe a slight hint of that lavender.

The dry down is pretty linear, and the fragrance more or less maintains that sweet, warm tobacco, spiciness, and wood notes. There isn't much evolution, but that's ok because this fragrance is fantastic. Shock definitely reads as an Oriental, dark fragrance.
Both longevity and sillage were moderate to weak for me. After about 2 hours, it sort of disappears. But, this EDT is so cheap, you can be very liberal with sprays and reapplication.
I'd wear this casually in the cooler months, day or night. I don't think this is a formal/dressy option, and for sure not something I'd wear in warm weather.
The value of this fragrance is phenomenal. They are practically giving this stuff away at discounters. I paid $20 for 100mL, and I've seen 200mL for only $30! At this price, I'd recommend CK One Shock for him to anybody who enjoys tobacco fragrances.
Overall, I really think this is a can't miss blind buy for anybody who enjoys a tobacco fragrance. It is a bit lacking in longevity and sillage, but again...it's so cheap you can just spray some more.

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"ONE REAL BIG SHOCK

In the last decade of the past century - seems like one million years ago - someone offered me a bottle of the original CK One. The year was certainly 1994 and that gift was a surprise for me. I never had seen it before in a Duty-Free shop, so that flask was certainly ""fresh bread out of the bakery"".
By then, all I cared about was Issey Miyake and Kenzo scents for summer days, Tuscany, Eau Sauvage and Paco Rabanne XS for the office and Kouros, Antaeus, Obsession, Boss Number 1 and Opium for a night out or partying. All of them had a magnificent and elegant presentation and had an extremely good performance, as well a very alluring scent... and a high price as a social toll. They were part of the ""créme de la créme"" back then, both for juice quality and looks (and price). Even today, all of them are perfume industry.

The original CK One was an unexpected launch for me. Although I liked Obsession very much (and still do) I did not care much about any other CK scent. I remember thinking that the fragrance was all wrong. It was democratically inexpensive (so it should be a bad scent), with an under-average performance (so it should be a bad scent), with a vulgar flask and no cap (so it should be a bad scent), unisex (so it should be a bad male scent), 200 ml flask volume like a big bottle of a cheap drugstore cologne (so it should be a bad scent), and with a transparent juice (so it should be a bad scent).
I never cared much about that bottle and later on, I gave it away as a gift, not to my father but to my father-in-law at the time (I did not like him all that much).
To my past century's astonishment, Calvin Klein kept on releasing new different multicoloured CK One flankers once every two years or so. Unconsciously I labeled them all as cheap and low-quality colognes, as I did before with the original fragrance back in 94. At the same time, Paco Rabanne released the inexpensive ""infamous"" Paco. Oh my god... it seems like a spreading disease. I did not realize then that this perfume democratization was indeed very healthy. Due to this type of product strategy, now we have a larger industry with a larger offer, both in quantity and in scent types, and an extremely wider consumer base. With that conclusion in mind, I now admit that CK One was probably one of the most important fragrances of the XX century.
Twenty years later, older, wiser and with a different father-in-law, I saw a very positive youtube review about the new not unisex CK One Shock. ""The reviewer must be sponsored by Calvin Kein"" has been my first thought. Six months and half a dozen ""Shocking"" reviews later, I bought my first bottle of Ck One Shock for Him. Two years and two bottles later, I'm writing my first review on the CK One Shock fragrance. However, so far I have not bought any bottles of the original CK One. For this to happen, I must be even older and wiser than I am now.
As everyone knows CK One Shock, I don't need to refresh your memory in this lines, describing its magnificent bracing pepper and cozy warm amber blended with the intense and creamy tobacco notes, the confort of having a family size bottle, and the smiling face I put on whenever I pay twenty and someting Euros for this 200 ml Eau de Toilete.
By the way, have you noticed that this fragrance is quite unique in the [price & scent type & presentation] combo?
And if you compare it with way more expensive similar fragrances like Herod, Spicebomb, Pure Havane and Kokorico, they have been released at the same time or after CK One Shock?
Now, the mathematical magic mirror for this thousand volts Shock:
_______________________
- Opening.: 9.5 (surprisingly good)
- Dry Down: 8.5 (still good, but more common and a bit faint)
- Longevity: 8.0 (up to 7~9 hours on my skin, with 2 sprays)
- Sillage: 7.0 (sillage up to 5~6 feet; it projects for 1.5 hours... flimsy)
- Versatility: 9.0 (just avoid the hot temperatures of summer days)
- Usability: 9.0 (a scent quite versatile and easy to please. Use it in all situations except beach, gym and sweaty events)
- Compliments: 8.5 (it will please a lot of people. Compliments will happen)
- Uniqueness: 8.0 (I will just mention, as a predecessor, a similar inexpensive fragrance: Bogart pour Homme)
- Quality: .8.0 (above average quality ingredients; good spray)
- Presentation: 7.0 (suitable for positioning in the mass market of which it is part)
- Price: 10.0 (200 ml flask in the range of €22,50~€29.00)

- Average: .8.41/10.00 (The only Calvin Klein fragrances I tested with this average classification were Obsession, both men and women)
between 7 and 8 => above average;
between 8 and 9 => recommended;
equal or bigger than 9 => don't miss it;

My conclusion: Gorgeous! I do recommend it even as a blind buy.

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"I am late to the game on this one, I had read and watched reviews on this one but never really planned on getting it. I was at Burlington a store I don’t frequent much then I see the 200ml bottle for $29. So I said well it’s just $29 if I don’t like it I will just gift it to someone that does. First I didn’t like the bottle you have to install the atomizer and it doesn’t have a cap. I have 2 other bottles that don’t have a cap bulgari aqua and Mercedes Benz club black atomizer is built in to bottle. Ok now to the scent; it is very similar to D&G pour homme the dark blue box. CK shock opens up kind of fresh with floral notes, I guess that is why people say it smells like a granny scent. There is a sweetness but on the ambery side, no candy not bubblegum just sweet and it stays throughout the scent. The freshness dies down fast and it gets a little spicy but not Spicebomb spicy just faint hints of pepper and there is waxy/oily feeling to it from the tobacco. I don’t get a sweet pipe tobacco it is more of a cigar raw leaf ready to be rolled a shiny oily leaf. It feels warmer because the sweetness of the amber. The patchouli it feels more noticeable on the dry down and can barely get the woodsy notes. The dry down feels it’s just three notes. For the price it is a good fragrance but I can say it might not please everyone, it is not polarizing but some people might not like this type of fragrance. Performance: projects for an hour then it goes closer to skin but still have a good bubble; after 6 hours it just starts to fade and it’s gone by the 8 hour mark on my skin. I can say it is a good alternative to the D&G pour homme if you want a little more sweetness with a bit less spice. Not a shocker but a decent cheapy and better than many clones out there costing more. I guess for the time it came out it was unique and it can keep up with today’s fragrances doesn’t feel so outdated.

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Tobacco, woods, baby powder, a hint of herbaceous notes. Smells decent for the low price of about $20-25 for a massive bottle at discounters and rack stores. A decent tobacco-centric fragrance for a younger guy branching out into something more mature, or someone on a budget, but it just can't compete with higher quality tobacco frags.

Definitely a cool weather fragrance, better suited for night, but could be pulled off on a sufficiently cold day.
Longevity is good, projecting pretty strongly for at least 3-4 hours and easily detectable within arms reach up to 8 hours.
This smells best in the sillage, which off of my skin is respectable at 6 feet or more and it leaves a trail.
Smelled close up, it's a bit irritating, headache inducing and nauseating. If you use this for date night, make sure it's not sprayed directly where someone will be nuzzling you.",09/25/23 14:43,K_Wood_22
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,much much better tobacco smell than the overhyped and overpriced le male elixir.,09/24/23 10:10,dabatch
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,I like the bottle i think its unique looking. This is not a good performer on my skin but it stays a long time on my clothes. This was my first tobacco fragnance and i can say that it has grown on me over time.,09/24/23 02:07,solsisod
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"I tried it for the first time and immediately noticed it was similar to another perfume. Encre Noire A L'Extreme. Yes, it looks quite similar. I'm not saying they smell exactly the same, but they are in the same style and remind each other. The difference is that Ck is more functional with a bit of citrus and amber.",09/22/23 07:23,ekremali-g
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"This smells like niche! Very delicious for a cheap designer. Bottle is cheap too


Overall - 8.5/10 good job ck",09/14/23 01:42,Ansarit
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"One of the best and most underrated cheapies ever. The tobacco and basil sweet smell is perfect in the car and office, I'll definitely purchase one. It's a shame CK didn't advertise CK shock effectively",09/11/23 13:34,Billy K.
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"The bottle is ugly. You have to remove the cap to insert the sprayer (like Serge Lutens bottles). I am not a fan of that due to exposing the fragrance to air.

That being said, for the price, it is a very nice fragrance that lasts for around 6 hours and radiates within an arms length. Perfect for Autumn and Winter. Can be worn by any age group, male or female.

As ""cheap"" as this fragrance is, you can't go wrong with it.
9/10 - Love",09/11/23 10:04,Vmaster
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"I blind bought a bottle of this back in like 2013 reading that it was something unique, and after having all the typical mall scents (Hollister, Buckle, Aero, Abercrombie) back at that time in high school, I wanted something that was a little different, interestingly, it being early fall time when I got it, I hated it at first, but after a couple of months, I ran out of every bottle, and this was all I had so I used it and somehow just absolutely loved it! I wanted to come back around now being almost 30, and again wanting something a bit unique as I build a small collection I saw this was still available and jumped on it for I think 30 bucks.

This hit exactly as I remember it did back in 2013. Though, I feel it is definitely a fall/winter scent overall, I've worn this recently in hotter weather, and it still was pleasant, not completely ideal in every facet, but I wouldn't rule it out. More evening, but I've worn it earlier in the day, and its still great, but I seem to gravitate toward these kind of heavy type scents regardless of the time of year, so that's just me. It has a very tobacco/warm and spicy/sweet type of thing that I really love in a scent.

Seems most folks give the sillage and longevity a bit of a down, I will spray a fairly liberal amount, and it'll last me through a shift at work + some, and it'll last on clothes into the next day. Love this stuff!",09/10/23 22:35,ISmellGood93
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,I love this fragrance. Burberry London smells similar to this one. I love and own both. I liked this one more because to me it smells like Cherry and Tobacco. Burberry London is more Vanilla and Tobacco. For those who smelled Burberry London swap Vanilla for Cherry and you'll smell Ck One Shock.,09/10/23 13:06,LoneWolf23
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"After desiring a tobacco note fragrance and hearing so much convo regarding this 'cheapie', I finally purchased a bottle.
It certainly does satisfy the need for a tobacco smell. Interesting combination of notes to achieve this goal.
Definitely nothing fancy here and not really worth more than the 25 buck pricetag yet works in a pinch.
Dries down to a more basic cologne smell with a remaining hint of 'tobacco'.

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"got 200ml for 27 euro, by far the best ml to price ratio fragrance ive ever had, however the bottle is kinda weird
the atomizer is strong, and it smells really good too",09/05/23 07:44,luciferianwrath
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Had to finally snag a bottle and check the hype, I wasn't expecting much... turns out the majority opinion is correct, this thing phenomenal for the price, and it's pretty dang solid if you just ignored the price. All the notes are there, and from start to finish it's a bit of an enigma - the opening is a nice fresh/spicy citrus+lavender but then goes an unexpected direction with mild, sweet tobacco-amber and has kind of a spicy cherry Dr. Pepper vibe. It doesn't smell cheap to me at all, but obviously isn't loaded with delightful naturals either - masterfully blended. Performance is moderate all-around with 4-5 hours longevity and mild projection, which I'm pretty happy with. Truly, this is a no-brainer dumb reach for cooler weather. CK killed it with this one. It's better than it has any right to be.",08/26/23 08:20,SketchMotive
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,It's such a fun winter/ fall fragrance with unique scent. It manages to convey tobbaco cherry vibe with just a hint of spices without making it extremely mature which I find unique. Good even for teenagers. Projection and Longevity could be better but the overall scent and quality to price ratio are awesome. I think it has lots of lattafa Asad vibe (not dior sauvage elixir as Asad and elixir do not smell similar to my nose) and is actually nicer and smoother. Weak projection and Longevity but it kinda works making the fragrance airy and not cloying which is not obvious with winter scents which can get overwhelming.,08/26/23 02:39,GoldenState
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"I used to absolutely love this when I first got it, but now Im finding that it gives me a migraine more often than not.",08/24/23 11:02,sullenhue
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"In all fairness, came back to this after a number of years and I honestly think this is a very under rated scent, horribly marketed, that spray paint “Shock” absolutely horrendous in fairness and it’s little wonder this flopped.

But the scent itself is very good imo, the tobacco is very nice imo, the lavender coming thru and the amber making it sweet, not a room filler, not a beast mode fragrance but an enjoyable one for a very good price.

In my collection I have expensive niche fragrances like Oud for Greatness, Naxos and designer like Ombre Leather and Dior Homme Intense plus many more and this is an everyday easy to wear fragrance that is inoffensive and mass appealing, it could easily be someone’s signature scent I’m that confident.

Such a shame the marketing was dreadful but on the upside not many people will be rocking this which will make you unique.

Still great. Banger for the price. Probably better for comder months but ill wear it all year round.",08/16/23 00:11,Zeusy
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"I love to wear this fragrance to work!! Longevity on my skin and clothes gives me around 10+ no kidding. And this stuff doesn't smell bad at all, so for 22.00 I believe it's a great low cost fragrance to wear to work or play.",08/15/23 21:08,Piggy41510
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,Really smells very similar to Burberry London. Very nice fragrance for the coldest days of the year. Superb quality for the price.,08/12/23 13:51,pitch
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"I just picked this fragrance up several hours ago from Burlingtons for $20 after seeing Ash of Gent Scents' recent review on it. After getting this on skin, I like it a lot. This is a really good cheapie especially if you like tobacco scents. This will definitely be in my fall/winter rotation.",08/10/23 19:05,Dworm84
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Smells like smothering your face with dry tobacco leaves in a tobacco processing plant with some sweet peppery undertones to balance it out. I am no smoker myself but this really does remind me of what a smoker smells like if it was turned into a pleasant perfume. It's okay, I guess, but not for me.",08/10/23 07:39,bananatrousers

CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Easily a top 10 Tobacco Fragrance and every single man should have this in rotation. CK’s marketing team failed miserably with this. I never wanted to try it because I expected it would be a newer version of CK ONE. Instead , we have one of the most beautiful fragrances I’ve ever experienced. Tobacco is soft similar to Pure Havane / Herod. Had this marketing team called this CK Havana or anything other than SHOCK (with goosebumps looking font) this would easily be the most expensive CK frag.",07/29/23 20:42,xavi617
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"nicely done, entry level of tobacco scent
among all my other perfumes this is the most i wear when i go to market, school or gym
it is cheap too",07/17/23 00:04,Onlineturk
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"CK Shock? More like CK disappointment! I mean, seriously, what's the hype about? The scent is so bland and generic that I could barely tell it apart from other cheap fragrances at the drugstore. And don't even get me started on the price - it's a complete rip-off for what you're getting. I wouldn't pay more than a few bucks for this kind of scent. Save your money and buy something better",07/16/23 22:10,trustyonose
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"This is not at all similar to Burberry London. Both are wonderful scents.

If Burberry London fits the Christmas scene in Wham's Lask Christmas music video

Shock goes well with the image of smoking whiskey and cigars in a high-class jazz bar with jazz music playing

In Shock's dry-down, the unique amber scent blends with the tobacco scent, giving it a soft chocolate scent. It's a luxurious scent

Why was it released as a ck line? I wonder, but it is one of Calvin Klein's best fragrances.",07/15/23 03:09,Shreem
CK One Shock For Him Calvin Klein,"Wouldn’t it be an enlightening experiment to line up a group of perfume lovers who believe that ‘you get what you pay for’ and give them a range of unmarked frags for blind testing. I’d like to see how they’d do, relying on their noses alone and not anything else to sort out high-end from low-end, works of art from hack jobs. One can say whatever they want about their ability to discriminate but who’s verified that ability?

@DarthFragrance I see no reason to dispute that point about ingredients, but it is your point, not mine. 😉",07/14/23 22:26,Sassafras23
