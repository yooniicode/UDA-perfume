Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,09/21/2024,Gaylon67,M,26,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,The Love Didn’t Last!,"In the fragrance section of Macy’s I sprayed this on a test strip. WOW! Loved it. Before leaving I sprayed it on my arm. From opening to the dry down I loved it. Had nothing like it in my collection. Two weeks later I put down $130 to purchase it. A little much but the quality matched the price. My wife was not as excited about it but said it was nice. (She’s rarely excited about me purchasing another bottle of cologne though.)

My first wearing I put too much on. Had to wash it off 1hr later. Wore it a second time the following week. Did not overspray but it was cloying about 90 mins. Knew I had a problem at this point! Did not wear it for 7 months. Did I purchased a cologne different from the one I tested in the store? Put it on today to see if my nose would welcome it again. Nope! Hate from the first spray.

I did it again. Purchased without buying a decant to give it a few wears. This is especially important with strong scents of this sort. A potential love or hate scent. One you can quickly grow tired of.

Unless you KNOW this is a scent DNA you like, sample patiently. Give it a 4, 5, 7 wears. It is a hard reach even if I still liked it. I am feeling guilt and shame and regret over this purchase."
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,10/27/2025,StinkSultan,M,54,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Guilty or Not?,"Guilt is not something that us, perfume afficionados, should deal with in this hobby. We shouldn't feel any form of guilt for liking or not liking a certain fragrance that maybe is highly acclaimed in the community, by friends, family, etc. Tastes differ, and so do preferences. And in regard of Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme, one of my father's favorite fragrances, I hardly feel as impressed by the scent. But I do see why it garnered so much attention.

The opening is properly intoxicating, with an immediate blast of orange blossom floral prowess, with a clear bitter facet and a potent white floral/jasmine sweetness. Warm, spicy, even slightly cinnamon-like nutmeg and pimento aid in keeping that white floral potency in check. But to no avail; the orange blossom eventually wins the round.

At the heart, things turn interesting, but not exactly in a good way. Under the load of orange blossom, a prominent powdery orris appears with a creamy/buttery accent as well. Hints of violet are also detectable. The osmanthus does seem to add some sweet fruitiness to the blend, but it's still unable to dethrone the main protagonist. However, it's at this point that I get a pretty strong hair fixative spray vibe which mildly burns the back of my neck as I breathe in. It's got that sharpness and chemical attributes which instantly reminded me of hair fixative. And while it's not enough to ruin or overpower the whole scent altogether, it's not trying to hide either.

As we reach the base, that hair fixative vibe does diminish, but the orange blossom is still very much present. Some patchouli brings a generous dosage of muskiness, but also sort of a medicinal nudge and a sweet undertone attributed to patchouli. The vanilla and benzoin do not seem as strong, bringing just a mild ambery warmth and powderiness. All things considered, I'm not the biggest fan of the scent structure, but it does gain a few extra points for being more unique on the designer scene than most other modern day entries. The overall blending and quality are nothing extraordinary, derived primarily from that hair fixative vibe that I get, which to my nose, doesn't hint at excellent quality, but rather at intoxicating attention-garnering composition. But then again, maybe my nose is betraying me by being too sensible (skill issue).

Speaking of attention-garnering, you'll be getting plenty of that with Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme, just there's a 50/50 chance that you'll get positive reactions. On my skin, this fume lasted for well over 24 hours. On my second wear, it even surpassed 34 hours. And I see that great longevity is largely the case for most people with Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme. So no worries there - this has plenty of fixatives to offer that performance, which might also be responsible for that chemical hair fixative vibe that I get. In terms of projection, I got a very solid 3+ feet for the first hour, with a very noticeable sillage. It would slowly mellow down to 2 feet across 2-3 hours, and eventually it would settle on less than one foot of projection by hour 6-7, still noticeable if you got close enough, e.g. sitting next to me.

While Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme is definitely guilty of having a load of fixatives for increased performance and intruding people's noses, it's not guilty of being Swiss Army Knife-level versatile. And that's primarily because of that performance. The scent itself is also, as mentioned, a bit more polarizing/intoxicating than your average designer (mostly due to that sharp fixative facet), so it limits the number of sprays. As a leisure wear, for clubbing or for more formal events, this would fit just fine. For office or school, or any context where you don't want (need) to stick out, keep the sprays on the lower side.

Verdict, your honor? Guilty of intoxication through the usage of fixatives. That's largely the only thing I find Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme guilty of. Do I find it guilty of being an irresistible scent? No. Do I find it guilty of being a high-quality creation? No. Do I find it guilty of huge success? Well... yes, it appears so. Amongst designers, Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme does manage to stand out, and I believe its slightly more polarizing (but not challenging) nature, paired with the performance are what drive the sales of this juice (and, well, the brand name too, as always). Do I believe it is a good value fragrance? Not really, but it could've been worse. Do I recommend it? Not really. So, therefore, I sentence Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme to a lifetime in my ""decent at best"" category. But what say you, people of the jury?

Overall Rating: 6.9/10"
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,09/05/2024,Shtinky,M,7,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,It’s not even close.,"This fragrance, is simply put, in another league when it comes to the basic designer fragrances. Gucci guilty elixir is to put it lightly the best thing you’ll find in a normal beauty store right now, this does what sauvage elixir should do but doesn’t.

To start, Guilty Elixir is like walking into a dinner party this beautiful orange blossom that you can almost feel the petals of greets you at the door and as you make your way to the dining room, as you sit down you notice the nutmeg and pimento take their seats on either side of you. However they don’t overstay their welcome they simply introduce themselves to you and fade into the background. As their friend calls them to sit farther down the table.

At the heart of this fragrance, they finally have the the majority of guests together and sat down at the table. Just before the food comes out as you’re talking to the osmanthus that had taken the place of nutmeg you feel something tapping on your shoulder, you turn to see who it is and time screeches to a standstill as you come face to face with an orris butter note that almost suffocates you with its presence, however, you don’t mind. This note is far and away the star of the show and the reason the party is so lively. The orris butter stays rest of the time this fragrance is on you, and as the evening progresses you choose to bring your dessert of vanilla and benzoin garnished with a bit of patchouli outside behind the house to deck where you notice a small creature laying on a bed next to a doggy door. It’s a small sort of cat from what you can tell and as you take a seat in one of the chairs it crawls into your lap.

Scent 10/10 - This score is relative to not only what this fragrance has parallels to but also to designer fragrances in general, this is at least “private blend” status and if not better as it not only deviates from the entire line its a flanker of, but its also the best thing outside of any private lines in the world of designer fragrance. Though it isn’t the best fragrance of all time, it is, in my opinion, completely unchallenged when it comes to current designer fragrance.

Versatility 8/10 - comfortably a cold weather fragrance but can easily be pulled off if the wearer is dressed maturely or at least if it’s later in the night.

Sillage 9/10 - No complaints, stronger than is required for a “night out” fragrance.

Performance 10/10 - set and forget. No need to worry about reapplying period, its a night out/date night fragrance and by proxy you don’t need it to last more than 5-7 hours yet it’ll still be comfortably projecting a couple feet around you by the end of those 7 hours.

Value 10/10 - This really should be a designer price but its at an entry level niche price and completely fine being there, not hard to find for around 100-140 but if you can’t find it then its to me worth every penny of retail."
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,01/05/2024,MattRotar,M,16,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Miracle scent,"You know, I almost feel like this fragrance found me not me it. Me and my girlfriend decided, we’ll get each other fragrances as gifts this holiday season. I decided on Elysium, which ive been wanting to get for a very long time, but never did get and she decided on Instant Crush. Than one day we went to the store and I saw this fragrance. I remembered George (YouTuber) talking about it and he said its reminiscent of Reflection man, but smoothened out with vanilla. So i was like ok im gonna spray it on, I did while we where leaving and didn’t smell it right away, because I definitively remember eating a pretzel (lol), when I finally did smell it, I was so surprised this smell I was smelling was coming from a designer house. Spicy, slightly fresh, smooth woods smashed with some of the best smelling vanilla I’ve smelt. I think Gentle Fluidity Gold is also a great vanilla, but this to me in the drydown smells like youre eating an amazing vanilla ice cream on a beach. You’re smelling the trees around you and the summer breeze…Absolutely Outstanding… I was back to the store 4 times to wear this and in the end chose it over Elysium. Now lets compare it to Reflection man. I have tried Reflection before, really wanted to make it my signature, because the iris and overall floral nature of the fragrance really spoke to me. Only problem was, that it went so sharp on my skin it started giving me headaches. This has that same powdery iris, along with the fresh like spices, but it doesn’t go sharp, the vanilla rounds up the whole story, making it so much more enjoyable for me. You might think that the vanilla will take away some of the versatility, … I would disagree. I think this is still perfectly wearable in all seasons. This fragrance man… all im gonna say is that ever since I’ve gotten it my other fragrances, have been getting a lot less wear because I wear it so much. That spicy, yet fresh opening that fades into the vanilla, but still retains the iris… ahh outstanding this to me is a bonafide 10 and my signature scent I’ve been searching for.

10/10

Update: I got my first bottle for Christmas 2023, its now 20th of June 2024 and I just got my 2nd bottle, because i finished the 1st. Lovely scent and extremely versatile, by far my girlfriends favorite scent on me also.
Still a 10/10

Update: the 3rd bottle just came in a few days ago. Still absolutely love it."
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,07/17/2024,GharibMD,M,12,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,A powerhouse from Gucci,"This is a nice fragrance with a great performance: eternal longevity and very good sillage: room filler in the next two hours or so

It smells really like a Quentin Bisch creation with a DNA similar to Le male Elixir but more polished and, refined and mature

The dry down is very pleasant: vanilla dominated: I sprayed it in the morning and I still can smell it 12 hours later: it stays on cloths even longer:

My main issues are:
1- bottle design could have been better, but who cares
2- The price point is a bit high for a designer brand"
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,12/22/2023,Omnipotato,M,388,,5,Worth The High Price Tag,"I heard a lot about this fragrance in the community and the fact that it was a departure from conventional men's designer perfumery; I decided to try it out the next time I was in Macy's and boy, did it blow me away.

The first whiff is undoubtedly white floral, with some peppery spices added to make it a bit masculine. This is not a bland clean soapy neroli like in Neroli Portofino EAU DE PARFUM or Myslf. It is dirty, almost animalic, and Floral with a capital F. Then a boozy note kicks in, which I believe is the osmanthus. I think this is one of the most underrated notes in perfumery, and I love almost every fragrance in which it plays a big role. The scent is rounded out by powdery orris butter and a touch of sweet vanilla. What surprised me, and isn't really in the note listing, is a bit of a leathery edge in the base notes which makes this fragrance undeniably masculine, even though the spine of the scent is white floral and sweet. Overall, a complex and immensely enjoyable fragrance from beginning to end. Although it bears a resemblance to Reflection Man, it is more sweet and also has that earthy, leathery edge that Reflection lacks.

Now we come to the pricing. 183 USD for 60ml is practically unheard of in the mainstream designer space, but I think it is well worth it. With Gucci Guilty Elixir de Parfum Pour Homme (an absolutely ridiculous name), you are getting niche-level quality, niche-level longevity, and niche-level complexity. When compared to the Amouages and Xerjoffs of the world, $183 is not a high price.

Lastly, what is with the bottle? Channeling AVGN a bit here, but could they have picked another color than puke green? The questionable marketing and bottle design aside, this is a great release, probably the best designer release of 2023 for me. Definitely not a blind buy."
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,03/29/2024,Bljczmln,M,24,,1,The best elixir,"Floral & little citrusy opening with a hint of spices and nuts and a soapy undertone. Beautiful dry down with a heavy creamy vanilla note but not in a gourmand way. Insane performance, prominent for well over 8 hours & i can still smell it on my skin over 24 hours later. Also a compliment magnet, almost all my coworkers said it so good. Yes it is overpiced a bit but the quality and performance is there so that at least maked up for that."
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,11/05/2023,Loubacca64,M,70,,1,Gucci bandana,"Ever since I've tried Gucci, I was only a fan of certain fragrances they have. ""Made to measure"" & ""Intense Oud"" being an example.
.
So I was skeptical about this one & so far I must say, I like it for the most part. It's pretty unique in its own way, the heavy dose of Orange Blossom, nutmeg & Orris butter make it pretty stand alone. It's creamy, it's fresh, spicy & a tad sweet behind it which almost feels green. U get the vanilla'ish kind of base in there pretty quick which I think is the combination of that & Orris butter that's making it so creamy & not so synthetic.
.
When I first sprayed it on, I felt like I was smelling something similar to YSL 'Myslf' & that was because of the Orange Blossom I was getting. But they are quite different. Like this is much more thick, subtly sweet & seems to have a bit of a waxiness to it. As to where, MYSLF is more synthetic, with the Ambroxan base. & also woodier, with the florals.
.
This scent has slight levels to it. & if you think it's too subtle, wear it once without layering it because I feel it has staying power. The longevity must be where the magic happens. I could wear this, day or night but would prefer a slightly moderate night, 45° - maybe around 60° weather. It can work in the cold maybe if you wear more on the cloths where it will probably stick better. This could also be worn at work just not putting on so much because it'll probably annoy ppl in such close range to have to constantly get whiffs of it. But I do think it's a mass appealer so, whatever, experiment, see what works.
.
I think women will think a guy has range when he wears this scent. It shows not everything has to be dark or synthetic like Paco rabanne or constantly worn like Dior Sauvage. Check it out that Gucci bandana

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,11/29/2024,Mossoak,M,16,,1,White flowers for the Lads,"It's 2024 (this launched in late 2023 but bear with me) and a designer label is releasing a big, dense, soapy and pungent white floral for men with the edges slighty rounded off with touches of vanilla. Is this real life? Here, a dowdy scent profile was given a rejuvenation treatment by one of the current industry's busiest perfumers Quentin Bisch and it did not turn out too shabby. In fact, this is rather good. The skanky aspects are still restrained enough to not completely scare off the target audience (which I assume to be men in the 20's and 30's) but they are noticeable enough to enjoy them and to commend Gucci for going off the beaten track.
The asking price is a bit bold for a 60ml but it's marketed as an ""elixir"", so they have an excuse at hand already."
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,10/07/2025,Warwolf6501,M,15,,1,Elixir done right,"This elixir flanker has gone to a different direction and smells very different from its predecessors just like what Dior did to Sauvage Elixir. Gucci Guilty Elixir is dense, woody, resinous and masculine floral. Think of Amouage Reflection Man with added resins and vanilla. A very complex and unique fragrance. This is what an elixir should be. This is trespassing into niche territory so be sure to sample first.

Projection - Strong
Longevity - 10 hours"
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,12/20/2024,Stinkykid,M,3,,1,Unisex pistacie,"Very smooth velvet like pistacie and thats all I smell. I could never get my self to buy but ended up collecting 10ml before deciding it was not for me.
The smell is so pleasing when i spray it on my friends and it can change some ones personality.
In the end it proved to feminine and IRL i only smell it on eastern women."
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,11/16/2023,Leimbacher,M,2870,,34,Umami a la Marsupilami,"“Guilty Elixir de Parfum PH” (what a name…) pleasantly surprised me. Not because the “Guilty” label is out of favor with me; there are enough positive outliers in this very broadly defined and colorful “family.” Much more because I am greeted by an enormously potent orange blossom apple, which can best be described as a wonderfully creamy blend of heavyweight fragrances like “Reflection Man,” “Fleur de Male,” and “Gaultier ²” - which should place enough weight on its shoulders, power in its lungs, and pressure in its fragrant argumentation!

At first, I thought this was a hardcore marzipan charmer. Too different, too surprising, too special this elixir seemed at the beginning. My brain was rattling. But then it dawned on me in half-minute intervals that it wasn’t marzipan I was smelling, but unbelievably concentrated orange blossom. Green, zesty, garnished with an even greener apple. A small miracle of technique and a feast for both the mind and the nose. Still clearly detectable the next day. And yes, I shower. Nevertheless, this is a stubborn little beast in gum-green. Buttery iris and vanilla form the backbone and provide enormous smoothness. Upfront, the orange blossom flares and hisses like it’s on steroids, yet still appears soft enough. An extremely floral yet powerful punch that could almost pass as niche and still offers nothing in terms of accessibility for the refined perfumista. Unusual and great to clearly declare it as “Pour Homme.” Rarely have I enjoyed smelling an intense powerhouse so much. Again and again. It could develop into a cult favorite and a secret tip. But today’s man needs to have more delicate eggs to pull it off casually. Nice Hulk with a bouquet of flowers. Kisses poison and gall.

Sillage: subtle is different
Bottle: green and toxic, good and round
Longevity: easily over 10 hours on my wrist and in a cloud around me

Conclusion: interesting Guilty variation with intense radiance and almost entirely new DNA - orange blossom overkill!"
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,05/30/2024,DSportello,M,134,,39,"Gucci Götterfunken or House of Gucci flexes, dude!","Elixirs are like underwear: You can never have enough of them. Jokes aside. Gucci plays the elixir game and wins, I boldly claim. When I sprayed this fragrance on my wrist in winter, I wasn't immediately impressed. However, as I left the store and was at the train station, I felt like the entire station hall was smelling of ""Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme | Gucci."" And..."
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,02/09/2024,Basti87,M,1062,,21,Best Elixir on the Designer Market?,"In 2023 or 2024, it is trendy to launch an elixir on the market. Dior has set the example with Sauvage, and several designer brands have followed suit. Paco, Gaultier, Boss, here Gucci, and soon YSL Y will also have an elixir. Most of these elixir additions are significantly more expensive and have almost niche prices. Of course, one should be skeptical when planning to acquire such a designer. At least the elixir versions from Dior and Gaultier were, in my opinion, great successes. Gucci has rather taken Sauvage as a model: 60ml for a hefty price of around €160. Unfortunately, this Gucci is currently only available in 60ml, which makes the price quite high compared to a more economical 100ml bottle, which is now also available for the Sauvage Elixir. If you search online, you can already find it for around €100, which is also quite expensive for a designer, especially since there are already quite a few niche fragrances available at good prices.
Designer or not, I think this Gucci is great! I can't really connect with the brand, neither fashion-wise nor with most of the fragrances. After ""Guilty Cologne pour Homme | Gucci,"" this is only my second from this brand in my collection. I found some quite okay, but I never really warmed up to them, especially from the designer line. This Guilty Elixir is by far the best from this brand and also one of the best designer releases in recent years. Of course, also because I am a big fan of Reflection Man and because this one specifically leans towards ""Reflection 45 | Amouage."" If someone is just looking for a cheaper clone, they won't save that much here, and the fragrance DNA is by no means 1:1, which I also find good. I have both Reflections, and this elixir is a great addition.

The perfumer is once again Bisch, who also created a great elixir for Le Male. I greatly appreciate his works, and here he has once again hit the mark. This time in collaboration with Gracia-Cetto, who is also an experienced and good lady in the business.
The packaging is absolutely unworthy of the price and simply abysmal. Not Gucci-like, and in terms of style, one could have at least taken a cue from Dior. Loveless green cardboard, loveless green bottle, average sprayer. There is nothing luxurious here, but the content counts.

The top note clearly leans towards the 45, but not as opulent and heavy. The fragrance is very easy to wear due to a pleasant freshness that resonates from the start. A nice floral freshness that is not too feminine and also reminds of Amouage's DNA. The slightly powdery freshness from iris is also very present here. Overall, in the first hours, you get a cheerful and stylish fragrance with a lot of orange blossom and a pleasant subtle spiciness that you can actually wear for any occasion. The powdery iris also provides a great clean touch with sensuality. The sweetness from the base sets in a bit earlier and reminds of a touch of Pegasus from Parfums de Marly, though here it is of course not as heavy. But a slightly metallic sweetness is quite sexy and lovely. A pleasant Ambroxan freshness is also very nice and far from being disturbing. Even though there are some similarities to other fragrances, this is, for me, a standalone scent. While it is inspired mainly by Reflection 45, it is a great fragrance that can also be worn without any problems in the height of summer.
The performance is really superb, and this is a prerequisite for this price. The sillage radiates extremely well, and the fragrance should last into double digits.

Overall, for me, it is a great year-round fragrance that can be easily integrated into everyday life and also unfolds its wonderful sensual effect in the evening. A fantastic blend of niche quality and a crowd-pleasing designer. The DNA is definitely very unique for the designer sector and stands out wonderfully for people who do not want to smell like everyone else.
For a blind buy, it is too expensive, as you can already get 100ml Reflection for under €200, and here 60ml even on sale for €100. I think it is worth it, but everyone should decide for themselves."
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,08/11/2024,TimoJ,M,94,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,19,Just another elixir?,"At first, I wasn't a fan of it, as it reminded me a bit too much of Reflection Man. However, when you spray it on the skin, a somewhat different picture emerges. A sweet, floral perfume that appears clean and elegant. In the drydown, it becomes softer, gentler, and smells at the travel altitude of the fragrance as if you were coating powdery, white almonds and sweet vanilla with a hint of leather. Here, several drawers open: An idea of almonds like Pegasus or something floral like Reflection Man. The latter, however, goes in a fresh/floral direction. Yes, it is another elixir, but probably perfect for anyone looking for a sweet, clean, and serious date scent that can also be worn on a regular winter day."
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,03/17/2024,Sirbennyone,M,499,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,21,One of the best designer fragrances at the moment! / A lighter alternative to my beloved Reflection Man (also 45)/ CLONE?,"Hello everyone,

You came out of nowhere, suddenly you were there, and I really didn’t know what to make of it...

What do I mean by that?

I actively follow the releases from the house less and the last few years have mostly been so-so... and the last really GOOD ones are already a few years back, so I didn’t know what to expect... especially since I didn’t even know (I’ll be honest) the fragrance pyramid. So better - in terms of being unbiased, one can hardly be.

A friend from the souk gave me a sample and enthusiastically said to me ""BENNY YOU HAVE TO TEST THIS"".... and I thought to myself totally ("") unenthusiastically, yeah okay...

But I didn’t know what I had in front of me...

A little backstory to what’s coming next. I have a certain history with Le Mâle EAU DE TOILETTE (my entry into the world of fragrances in 1999) and Reflection Man (it was my first niche fragrance in 2012 and my wedding fragrance in 2021) and shortly after came Reflection 45 and I’ve known Darley for over 10 years, just as a side note!

The Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme has something of everything, fougere, floral, clean, pleasant, almost zesty (it feels that way in the top note) only it is much lighter than all 4 (mentioned) and a SHORT SUMMARY of it.

In the upscale designer segment (in a price range with Chanel and possibly Dior), it is, in my opinion, one of the best fragrances you can buy for up to €105! And I say this honestly and with full conviction.

Testing it is truly a must,
especially if you like the direction and the H/S...

Now to the performance:

The current batches of Reflection Man (recommendation until 2021), the current Reflection 45 unfortunately also (recommendation until February 2022, not later), with Darley only until 2020 and the more recent Le Mâle EAU DE TOILETTE is almost a disgrace, is well known, so please only until 2020! And the Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme easily outperforms all of them, with Reflection 45 it is on par, and THAT is more than remarkable!

CLONE?

NO!

But you can tell that the house looked left and right on the market and took inspiration. It’s already their style and not a CLONE!

When + where!

Always!

I say this very rarely, but it applies here. It works always, fits every occasion and season.

And so far (tested for 2 weeks) the feedback has been AMAZING!

A rising star....., I wouldn’t be surprised!

If I really weren’t convinced, I wouldn’t recommend it to you!
(At least for a test)

And now have a nice day/evening or whenever you read this review, best regards, Benny

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,04/03/2025,Sabattino,M,2,,15,Is anyone interested in my collection?,"Felice, also known as Duftbunker, drew my attention to the Elixir. At first, I thought, what am I supposed to do with a designer fragrance since I've only been into niche scents for years. In the evening, the recommendation popped back into my mind, and I sought out other opinions on Parfumo. You know how it goes. After reading the good reviews, I set out to find the Gucci and wondered why it was so much more expensive compared to other designers. Anyway, today we're in a generous mood, so why not? Other niche fragrances were much more expensive, so into the cart it went, and I paid. P.S. The Rasasi Hawas Black also had to join in.
Today the fragrances arrived, and I eagerly unboxed the Gucci. A couple of sprays on my right arm and a sniff. A smile spread across my face, and I thought, yes, there it is, my typical Gigolo powdery Italian DNA. It becomes a bit creamier over time without losing its DNA. Che Bello.
Damn, does the designer smell good. I found my signature scent after years of searching; this is it. Who needs niche? I don’t want my collection anymore, just this Gucci. In the meantime, I sprayed Black Hawas on my left arm and thanked Felice for the recommendation via WhatsApp. While writing, the best scent I’ve ever smelled came to my nose. I was perplexed and thought, what a combination. I’m not a fan of layering, but this time it had to be done. Gucci meets Black Hawas. The result has been an atomic Italian powder DNA paired with a dirty deep pineapple for hours now. OMG, this is it. I will combine the two bottles, 50ml to 50ml, and that will be my signature. Does anyone want my collection?"
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,06/27/2025,powlifume,M,46,,14,I am guilty...,"...of smelling damn good.
For a long time, I have been searching for adequate and truly good substitute perfumes for ""Reflection Man | Amouage."" I found nothing. Not even in ""Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme | Gucci."" What I did find, however, is a truly intense and wonderful scent experience revolving around the RM DNA. The Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme is sweeter and spicier, overall louder, more seductive, and thus also more intrusive than the ""Reflection Man | Amouage,"" and it comes closer to ""Shiyaaka Silver / شياكة | Khadlaj / خدلج"" than to the RM. In doing so, it surpasses the Shiyaaka in all respects, especially because it is significantly sweeter, more embracing, and rounder.

I find the top note to be very, very strong. It reminds me of ""1 Million (Eau de Toilette) | Rabanne."" Sweet, spicy, somewhat synthetic, but in a very good way. The scent is mature and far from any Talahon tendencies. The opening lasts surprisingly long, and eventually, it becomes creamier, softer, but by no means light. On the contrary, the spiciness and depth remain, just with less Neroli punch, but rather with Neroli background music.

Unfortunately, it is now summer, and the scent does not hold up well in temperatures above 30°. It becomes almost overwhelming, if not for you, then for your environment. Everything below 25° is optimal. The best perception probably occurs at a comfortable room temperature of around 20°.

So, anyone looking for a truly great designer fragrance with excellent longevity and sillage, who tends to be extroverted or even extravagant, will find this scent to be a perfect choice. Just don’t wear it in the office. It’s simply too strong and omnipresent for that. Three sprays are already a statement. In leisure time, when going out, in the evening, or on cooler (summer) days, the scent is a sure bet. And generally, it’s more of a special occasion fragrance than for daily use.

It definitely does not replace ""Reflection Man | Amouage."" The Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme scent stands on its own. A family member, like the more impulsive Italian cousin, but by no means a brother or even a twin. It has nothing to do with ""Le Mâle (Eau de Toilette) | Jean Paul Gaultier,"" even if they could be roughly placed in the same direction. How do people come up with such comparisons?

I would advise against blind buys here, especially for those looking for an RM substitute. You will be disappointed. In my opinion, there is currently no adequate good substitute or comparison for the RM; even a ""Shiyaaka Silver / شياكة | Khadlaj / خدلج"" cannot come close.

There has already been enough said about the bottle. The sprayer is good, the bottle is solid, nothing I would place right at the front of my shelf; the juice is what matters most here.

Maybe I will continue searching, maybe not. If such gems emerge during research, the RM will not be replaced but rather complemented by joyful new discoveries.
In the meantime, I will continue to be guilty of smelling damn good."
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,01/19/2025,Rupw00d,M,8,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Versatile All-Rounder in Niche Attire for Special Men,"My little fragrance wardrobe is to retain the title of Signature, in order to generate the desired aspect of olfactory recognition: I am not a collector, but merely a user! For the current cold days, I have found two outstanding scents that ideally cover the areas of everyday life and special occasions. For the latter, it has become the Tony Iommi Monkey Special by Xerjoff, which has shone brightly during the Advent season, and for daily business, it is the Elixir by Gucci - perhaps the best among the successful Elixir variants from other houses. It has even displaced my Layton Exclusif. The Elixir comes in a niche attire, primarily created by its richness in facets rather than artistic edges! This is worth a review.

The orange blossom is initially very present, but it comes across as significantly sweeter than sharp neroli representatives; the extraction of the same resource is known to differ. The smooth, slightly sweet orange note is therefore never fresh for me and already feels warm and caressing with the spicy, almost nutty component. Here, the exciting advantages become apparent: the masculine base DNA, later complemented by a bright leather twist, is olfactorily formulated with a nearly feminine aspect by the lovely white flowers. Just something for special men. The feminine facet is also underscored by the vanilla in the base, which, in combination with the orange blossom, enhances a sweetness that still beautifully caresses the masculine, nutty spice, bright leather, and dry wood. Highly intriguing!

The mentioned leather twist is a subject of controversial discussion here. I definitely perceive it clearly, and it is certainly produced by the osmanthus flower, which has this characteristic. On the other hand, I hardly smell the iris; at least not in the lipstick style, but at most as a slightly powdery lightening of the composition. The base and the late dry down are already dominated by an ambered vanilla, which somehow still retains the building blocks of the fragrance progression. My other pick for winter is very ""patchouli-heavy,"" so I am sure I am blind to this note here. Speculative.

Overall, this varied composition is also a real powerhouse. I get through the entire day excellently, receive positive feedback, and it gives me a few extra percentages of confidence. I can even smell it on my clothes the following day. I really like the sprayer: nice and crisp, and it doesn’t release a ton of juice. I like that just as much! The bottle, however, doesn’t appeal to me as much. A magnetic cap would also have been nice for the price. Speaking of price: I got it for just under 110.-, which is certainly justified; the retail price is quite steep. I even believe that the ml price of Reflection Man is better, but I don’t feel like doing math right now. It’s the weekend.

Due to the mentioned richness in facets from a positively interesting composition of masculine and feminine notes, the Elixir comes in a niche attire: orangey-floral sweetness combined with nutty spice, a great bright leather twist, and an ambered vanilla in the base. Always in the background, it is also plump + dry instead of juicy + fresh. I’m trying to look a bit beyond the horizon. If there had been one or another barbershop note anchored, I could even imagine it as a successful neo-fougere. In this composition, however, that thought goes too far for me.

The Elixir by Gucci is truly successful and versatile. A great signature for special men. Only in the height of summer and at the gym do I see it as out of place, as it already has a pleasant warmth that is quite powerful. Special men here is meant in a value-free way; it would be better to say, a special type of man. He is not a leather-jacket bad boy, but still fits due to the contrast with a fashionable all-black outfit. Generally, he is better dressed than casual and somewhat more suitable for clubbing, dates, and Netflix & Chill than for the office, where I also find him very suitable. Only sports are out for me, as he is never refreshing. He fits a confident man who is not only interested in fashion but is also eloquent and open-minded. So the label 'special' in the title should rather be interpreted as 'versatile.' The classification by age is more difficult. He does seem very modern, but at the same time has something established: serious and cultivated in the background, but interpreted very playfully.

The statements regarding the classification highlight the numerous controversies, which make me evaluate the Elixir as very exciting, almost insignificant, and certainly not suitable for every man. Nevertheless, it is a compliment-getter, even if I cannot give a buy recommendation here. Still: Definitely test it! I will celebrate it until late spring. Cheers."
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,06/24/2024,Kurdimon,M,16,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,A Floral Bomb,"The Gucci Guilty Elixir is a very strong floral, sweet fragrance. In the opener, it immediately starts with its floral notes, and these floral notes remain with us throughout the development of the scent. After a while, the fragrance becomes a bit spicier and sweeter. Thanks to the orange blossom absolute in the top and heart notes, the Gucci Guilty Elixir has this floral touch; the sweetness comes from vanillin, and the spicy notes come from nutmeg. Despite its strength, the Gucci Guilty Elixir smells very pleasant and will not cause headaches for those around you. The longevity is very strong, and even after several hours, the scent is still very noticeable. The sillage is also very good, and one is usually perceived positively. The Gucci Guilty Elixir can be worn in any season, although I would not wear it in the height of summer due to its sweet and spicy notes. The Gucci Guilty Elixir can be worn during the day as well as in the evening. In my opinion, it fits excellently when one is dressed smartly, such as in a shirt or a suit, and then sprays the Gucci Guilty Elixir on themselves. In terms of price, it is quite expensive for a designer fragrance, and currently, it is only available in 60ml. I find 60ml for just under €100 to be quite expensive for a designer fragrance. All in all, a very good release from Gucci, and the Gucci Guilty Elixir has definitely earned the name addition ""Elixir."""
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,07/07/2024,Westi87,M,40,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,"A Touch of Gucci in Trieste, complex, refined scent","Although not Florence, but as long as it's Italy.
I tried this Gucci yesterday in Trieste, the brand fitting for my Italian vacation, due to positive feedback here on Parfumo.

One thing upfront: it’s unfortunately not quite my scent, but it really has a lot to offer. Of course, one expects a lot here, as it is positioned a bit higher in the designer fragrance price range.

But let's take it step by step.
First, I sprayed it on cautiously because it projects well, and yes, I can confirm that. Good thing it was very warm outside; I would have stood out immediately indoors. The longevity is also very good; it lasted over 12 hours on me. But that’s to be expected, Elixir de Parfum.

The opening starts sweet-spicy with a lot of nutmeg and a slightly orangey-floral touch. However, the nutmeg is unfortunately too prominent, and my nose immediately has the reflex to turn away when I get too close to the scent.

In my opinion, the top note is not very mass-appealing, but here it shows that Gucci doesn’t really care, as they follow their own, special path. Also, due to the price, it’s not a product for everyone. But that’s completely fine; mass appeal is not necessarily what moves me personally.

On the way from Trieste to Lake Garda, my partner had to endure it for several hours in the passenger seat; it wasn’t really her scent ;)
Don’t get me wrong, it’s really well made.

However, what came after 2-3 hours pleasantly surprised me. The bothersome sweetness loses its intensity, while the slightly orangey-floral remains, and it becomes woodier. The woodiness balances out the remaining floral aspect and brings the scent into better harmony.
It smells much better and more special to me.

Just Gucci quality, for which many are surely willing to pay the asking price.

Towards the end, vanilla and benzoin come into play. I actually like this sweetness; it rounds off the scent well and lingers as a base for a long time.

For me, it would have been worth the money if the top note didn’t linger on my skin for so long. An overall complex scent that, in my perception, has strengths in the heart and base notes & weaknesses in the top note.

I like the bottle; the color scheme fits the scent, and the spray head is fine. The bottle is also elegantly designed; you can see the attention to detail from the house of Gucci. Really well done.

I will test more fragrances from this brand because I was impressed by the fine tuning of the individual scent components.

Hopefully, the next Gucci fragrance will also catch me with all scent stages from start to finish…"
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,01/22/2025,DM1982,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,"Great scent, but the bottle doesn't fit...","Gucci Elixir pour Homme is truly a wonderfully beautiful fragrance. The first impression is fresh and spicy with a slight sharpness - really pleasant and not exaggerated. Then it becomes warmer and aromatic. The base is the highlight: Amber and patchouli give the fragrance a long-lasting, high-quality depth.

The longevity is top-notch - a few sprays easily last all day. The sillage is just right, not too overpowering, but you will definitely be noticed. Suitable for everyday wear or special occasions.

The only point that doesn't quite fit for me is the bottle. It doesn't seem as high-quality as the fragrance itself and doesn't reflect the elegant feel of the elixir. I would have preferred a design that better emphasizes the quality.

Overall, however, it's a really good fragrance that is worth its price. Anyone who enjoys elegant scents should give it a try."
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,03/17/2024,Emre95,M,12,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,A Reflection Man Clone???,"Fragrance description: In terms of fragrance category, it leans towards Reflection Man, but without being a true clone. The differences in comparison are that Reflection Man smells more natural, floral, and fresher than the Gucci. The Gucci is definitely sweeter and more synthetic. I prefer the Reflection Man in terms of DNA but find the Gucci scent quite nice as well.

Fragrance development: The scent starts fresh, slightly sweet, and somewhat floral. Later, it becomes increasingly sweeter and spicier. The freshness also disappears quite quickly, and the sweet and spicy notes take over accordingly.

Compliments: This is my wife's favorite scent. However, I haven't received any compliments yet. (Excluding family and close friends)

Longevity: The scent lasts about 9 to 10 hours on the skin. On clothing, about 12 hours. I spray this fragrance about 4 to a maximum of 6 times.

Sillage: Unfortunately, I can only smell the fragrance on myself for the first few hours. At some point, I no longer perceive the scent. However, one time I sprayed the fragrance at 6 AM and was back home by 6 PM, my wife asked if I was wearing the Gucci scent. Even though I become olfactorily blind to the fragrance at some point, it is still present for others. It's not beast mode, but it plays at the top.

Versatility: It’s actually suitable for everything except in high summer, as the fragrance lacks the lightness for high temperatures. Otherwise, it's suitable for everything.

Bottle: It's okay but unfortunately nothing special. I really like the green. The cap and the sprayer are also just okay for the price.

Price/Performance: I find the retail price of 164 euros for 60 ml a bit too high for what you get. However, one must not forget that it is a perfume concentration with a higher fragrance oil content.

Overall assessment: I find the fragrance successful. For me, one of the best releases in the designer sector. However, I would only repurchase the fragrance if it’s on sale. When you calculate the retail price for 100 ml, you can already get fragrances from Parfums de Marly or Xerjoff. Nevertheless, it is a successful release, even if I don’t see it as a masterpiece. 8/10 overall from me."

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,03/24/2025,JimmysScents,M,10,,4,Gucci Guilty Elixir: A fragrance that sends orange blossoms on steroids!,"A completely different kind of ""Elixir"" from the scent like Sauvage Elixir, and yet I like it very much, as do the people who have smelled it on me. This one is the best of all the Elixirs that came out after the Sauvage Elixir. A beautiful floral scent, although it doesn't change much during the drydown. Still, it has something ADDICTIVE about it, as I keep catching myself sniffing my arm and can't get enough of it. This Gucci strongly reminds me of the floral fragrances from the 90s and 00s; I don't know why I associate it with that, but it gives me those memories afterwards. The scents/vibes of that time. It would fit well as a going-out fragrance in the nights/clubs of that era (also in today's time). In any case, I somehow connect that with it. This Gucci can be worn year-round and is more suitable for the cooler evenings in summer. The bottle is a bit ugly. But the inner values count, and the JUICE is what matters. I find this addictive sweet floral scent can be worn anytime and fits both for going out at night and during the day in casual clothes. It can be worn by a well-dressed gentleman (NO suit with tie) as well as by a casually dressed contemporary. A versatile fragrance in every direction. The Gucci Guilty Elixir is a scent that takes the senses on a fascinating journey. With its floral-sweet and spicy composition, it creates a perfect balance between elegance and intensity. The top note of orange blossom absolute, nutmeg, and allspice opens the fragrance with a zesty freshness that immediately grabs attention. The heart note of iris butter and osmanthus gives the perfume a buttery smoothness and a subtle floral quality, while the base note of ambrofix, vanillin, and patchouli provides a lasting warmth.

The longevity and sillage of the fragrance are impressive, making it an ideal companion for special occasions.
Gucci Guilty Elixir is a scent suitable for both everyday wear and special moments, always leaving a lasting impression.

The longevity is a 9/10
The sillage is an 8/10 and initially strong, but after some time it diminishes a little and is not as intense as at the beginning, yet still noticeable. An all-around successful fragrance that finds its friends over time and has already found (me among others). Simply a top fragrance."

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme,05/24/2024,Boenne1987,M,12,,3,Reflection so close yet so far away,"I learned about the Gucci here in the forum and had to test it, as I really like my Reflection 45. So today I quickly went to a perfume store and sprayed it on. At first, it didn’t remind me of RM at all; there was a note that stood out strongly and I didn’t like it at all, which lasted about 1.5-2 hours. After that, finally the Reflection came through and it was quite close to the whole thing, unfortunately sweeter and more synthetic. Now, towards the end, I feel like it’s getting warmer with a vanilla note and slight Reflection vibes; after about 6 hours, it’s quite close to my skin and approaching the end.
I like the candidates from Amouage much better. As a standalone fragrance, it’s really good for a designer and worth buying, but you should definitely smell it beforehand, especially because of the piercing initial note. However, the 60ml for €164 seems a bit expensive to me; around €100 would be justified.

Gucci pour Homme II,02/19/2015,ColinM,M,516,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Gucci pour Homme I High School Edition,"Gucci pour Homme II is a pleasant, “generically” elegant and cozy designer fragrance, undoubtedly a tad inferior to Gucci pour Homme I, which shows a completely different (and superior) class and quality. But still, it’s nice. Number II is soft, easy going and to some extent a bit cheap; but it is also without doubts pleasant to wear, and that is always a plus in my book. It is basically built on some features of Gucci pour Homme I (you can feel the same synthetic cedar-incense accord), but all twisted with the silky powderiness of violet, a sweet-fruity tone, slightly creamy-lactonic too, and overall with a brighter and cleaner atmosphere. The tea note is really nice, and together with violet and tobacco creates a fresh (yet warm too), cozy, gentle feel of peaceful and sweet softness, almost plushy, well contrasted by a hint of leather (modern, finished, “posh”) and woody-peppery notes. Incomparable to the hyper-refined, adult, sharp and shady smoky woodiness of Gucci pour Homme I... but as I said, really pleasant and worth the low price. The combination of sweet-fruity notes and “pencil sharpener” cedar reminded me a bit of Balmain’s Carbone. Discreet, yet long-lasting persistence. Nothing groundbreaking, but solid!

Gucci pour Homme II,01/22/2022,Elysium,M,898,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Black Tea Deluxe,"Where do I even begin? Gucci Pour Homme II is such a lovely scent, a modish and fashionable breakfast tea. The bergamot and black tea blend remind the well-known Earl Grey, a top-of-the-tier timeless classic. Aromatic bergamot adds a refined tart citrus taste to the dark, full-lead tea with prized tiny silver tips!

I blindly bought a bottle because of the smoky notes. What a pleasant surprise! I would say a pretty linear fragrance, which is built around the preeminent black tea note, not a light white or lemon green tea you get in Bvlgari pour Homme EAU DE TOILETTE, rather a more oxidated and strong oolongs one like a dark English Breakfast tea. That note gives the scent an intense sweet caramel, malt, and mineral stone-like vibe, with oaky undertones. Despite the azure color of the juice, GPH II is not aquatic, not citrus, and not a sports scent.
I got to know of this fragrance when it was first launched back in 2007, but I was so skeptical about that, thinking it was yet another aquatic one in the universe, and despised it for too long. Oh, man, I was so damn wrong! Gucci pour Homme II is seriously so gorgeous and smells so good.

In the open, I get a fresh and clean burst of creamy bergamot blended with green violet leaves, which fades quickly and leaves a dark tea trail, with a tad of spicy cinnamon and a bit of sweet paprika. Well, my gut feeling is that it incorporates one of the best tea notes and blends it correctly with the herbal violet leaf and the sweet-smoky tobacco. That concoction creates a cool-warm effect, soothing, comforting, and slightly sweet.

Ultimately, I get the myrrh and the tobacco notes in the dry down, which accentuates the ruggedly masculine sexiness that I find intriguing. The perfume stays close to the skin, making it ideal for crowded places, but I don't see any issues with longevity. After several hours, if I smell my wrists, the fragrance is still over there.

GPH II is versatile. It works well in spring and fall when the weather is slightly warmer, and the bitter-aromatic myrrh gives its best. Excellent for office and casual day, evening, or a night out. Today was a pleasant cold spring day, and the scent went well with my skin.

To me, GPH II has something in common with Aura for Men, meaning that they are not one another replica, though they share the same vibe, and the blend of tea and tobacco are very similar.

If ever there was an example of ""less being more"" or rather just the perfect amount this is it! GPHII is a fresh and slightly aromatic Gent but also has the perfect hint of spice in his personality coming through. While the violet leaf opens the visit with a slightly sweet hello the cinnamon offers just the right amount of interest and softly spoken conversation to be a welcome guest in his subtle sillage. The pleasant stay of sipping tea ends with a hint of tobacco from his pipe and the woody notes waving good-bye leaving the host and all that have made his acquaintance quite satisfied.

Gucci pour Homme II,07/19/2024,Adrian18233,M,42,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,A true gentleman in the world of perfume,Gucci Pour Homme II is one of those scents you wear for personal enjoyment and may go unnoticed by anyone else around you. The black tea brings this fragrance to a lovely skin scent and it performs well in most weather situations. I am curious about using the shower gel and deodorant with this fragrance to see what may boost the projection (highly doubtable). It is unfair to compare this to the original Gucci Pour Homme which has be regarded as a much longed for classic thanks to designer Tom Ford's direction for fragrance. GPHII will please the fragrance lover who desires to remain inoffensive as well as achieve satisfaction solely in a skin scent. It will remain in my collection and fill in that spot where I do not care what to wear that day and yet want to remain anonymous by scent.

Gucci pour Homme II,02/21/2013,Drseid,M,828,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Proves Spiced Black Tea And Incense Go Fabulously Together...,"Gucci pour Homme II opens immediately with a beautiful violet note coupling with mild peppery spice. As the scent moves to the heart phase, the violet remains though in a subdued state with the early pepper spice now swapping places with cinnamon, the spotlight now focused on the scent's real stars, black tea and non-smoky incense. The overall accord turns slightly sweet soon after, as a honey-like accord slowly grows as time passes and remains through the finish. As it enters the dry-down, a very pleasant tobacco leaf and woody tandem emerge from the base as it joins the remnants of the heart accord to send off the scent. Projection is good and longevity is average at 8-10 hours on skin.

Gucci pour Homme II is a very pleasant scent on the whole. It is relatively fresh and slightly sweet, but it really is the black tea and incense that make the scent work. The overall accord just seems so smooth and easy to wear that the scent excels at versatility as very few will find it anywhere near offensive. If I had any gripe with Gucci pour Homme II it would have to be that it lacks in the distinctiveness department to some degree. That is really nit picking a very nice effort by Gucci on this one and should not put anyone off from giving Gucci pour Homme II a try. That said, for a bit more distinctiveness and performance in a somewhat similar vein (sans tea) folks may want to additionally sample LiquidNight by A Lab On Fire that is more accomplished, in my opinion. Inconsequential gripe aside, Gucci pour Homme II smells very good in it own right and earns a well-deserved rating of 3.5 stars out of 5."
Gucci pour Homme II,02/05/2012,Missk,F,1357,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Sensual black tea and spicy tobacco,"I am really impressed with Gucci's male fragrance range. I have loved each and every one of them, so much so that I've even considered wearing them myself.

Gucci pour Homme II is deliciously spicy, refreshing and sexy. It would make a fantastic all-year round scent, for all seasons and all occasions.

It's masculine yet subtly sweet. It opens with a green yet floral violet leaf note followed by an interestingly citrusy bergamot and spicy cinnamon composition.

Exotic spiciness is what makes this fragrance. The black tea note really brings out an exquisite uniqueness in Gucci pour Homme II.

Fresh yet warm, this fragrance tends to contradict my senses a little. One minute it's a comforting scent, the next minute it is rousingly sexual. The myrrh and the tobacco notes in the drydown really accentuate the ruggedly masculine sexiness that I find so intriguing.

The lasting power is excellent so there is no reason why I should not recommend this fragrance so highly."
Gucci pour Homme II,01/22/2014,StinkBrain,M,2,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Just mmm....,"Gucci Pour Homme II initiates with a tea and incense medley. Gradually, the pimento emerges but remains well-behaved in the background with the musk. There is a minuscule sweetness that might be coming from the cinnamon, but the overall composition is spicy and smooth. I can see why some are comforted by the scent, as there is a soothing warmth about it.

The floor manager at the local Ulta store has smelled a multitude of perfumes on me, and this one was easily her favourite. ""Ooh! What is that?!"" was her immediate reaction. She told me it was the best thing I've tested in her store. I had never seen her eyes so wide. :D

As projection is fairly limited on my skin, this seems well-suited for a nice, cool evening in close quarters. It has slowly moved into my favourites, as the soothing scent of Gucci Pour Homme II lasts all day and puts a smile on my face. I might even buy a second bottle while I still can.

Gucci pour Homme II,03/03/2021,Smellavision,M,205,,2,Subtle but sublime...,"Such a masterfully composed scent...

Tea, cinnamon, tobacco, woody myrrh, musk and a hint of pepper (maybe the pimento?) all swirling together to form a higher purpose. It's fresh, slightly spicy yet sweet, smooth and classy. Very subtle and calming, but this also makes for an excellent office frag. Also it's rather unique and the closest thing I've smelled must be Lalique's Equus where the woodiness comes from the cedar-like sequioa. Maybe even a tad of Burberry London lurking in the background with the tobaccco/cinnamon combo there.

The only downside of this beatiful scent is the weak projection, really a pity. Definitely sample worthy."
Gucci pour Homme II,04/23/2020,Dan81,M,17,,0,Chill pill,"I am a smoker who wants my cigarette smell to blend with my cologne, instead of fighting them. Gucci Pour Homme II with its Tobacco leaf in the base notes had been intriguing for me as a spring/summer fragrance. I ordered a 10mL sample and the juice has this nice soothing babyblue color. The Bergamot is very short lived in my nose and I get the black tea and Cinnamon right away. The tobacco and musk in the base are subtle and excellently mixed. Another reviewer's description as an ambien or valium resonates with me, Gucci pour Homme II is like a chill pill. Performance, longevity and sillage are not the greatest but this is not an extrovert smell but an introverted one that I find soothing. I like it a lot, but I don't know of an occasion to wear it. I encounter the same issue as I do with Acqua Di Gio Profumo: an excellent mature scent but it's a calming downer. I do not find it elating and often don't reach for the bottle: Profumo I still like to wear on hot summer nights when I want to appear somewhat sharp, but with Gucci Pour Homme II I can only imagine wearing it to calm myself down for a nap in Spring/summer time. I can't think of a good (enough) occasion to wear it and I am not planning on getting this discontinued line."

The one with those indefinable blue flowers in it, which smell so fine and give it an irresistible aroma. *This* I drink more consciously, a very special pleasure for me, preferably in the afternoon, without milk, with rock sugar or tea sugar, at the best tea hour, and indeed all year round, even on hot summer days. When I drink it, I feel light and warm, my thoughts take beautiful paths...

When I drink this Earl Grey, I think of Gucci pour Homme II. When I wear Gucci pour Homme II, I think of Earl Grey Special.

Gucci starts citrusy-soapy-muted, with a slight spiciness, a bit green. Very soft. The violet leaf sneaks in immediately and will from now on run through the fragrance completely with a very subtle, bright floral note, always supported by a delicate hint of cinnamon. This duo: violet leaf and cinnamon - dominates the character of Gucci pH II and gives it this fine aromatic quality permanently.

Here, L´Artisan's Tea for Two is mentioned as a fragrance brother, which I can personally understand, but Gucci pH II lacks any trace of smoke, which Tea for Two contains abundantly. Gucci remains thoroughly fine-bitter and soft, the latent bitterness is mildly fruity, it is fresh and warm at the same time, it is bright and friendly, not strong, smoky, or dark. It has something loving, gentle, feminine, and yet it is also noticeably masculine.

The floral note is not floral. The softness is not soft-boiled ;-). The feminine is not ladylike. The bitterness is not harsh. The tannins, despite their natural bitterness, are not fuzzy on the tongue (or in the nose). The fragrance has something of lukewarm, soft water, it envelops me with kindness and affection, or so it seems to me.

Towards the base, not much changes. Wood comes in, it is *naturally* a soft, light wood, not sharp, dark, or strong. Everything remains relatively close to the skin, but with appropriate dosing, Gucci pH II is also perceivable to the outside world, yet it never imposes itself; its beauty reveals itself in the moment you approach it lovingly -- its soft, deep beauty, which I like more and more the more often I get to experience it.
Yes, I have to admit: I do not want to do without it anymore, neither now nor later, it is at the top of my wish list. I also have nothing to complain about regarding its longevity - it is significantly better than one would expect given the rather close projection.

When I think about it, those little blue flowers in the Earl Grey Special must be violet flowers. For me, the circle closes consistently here, and Gucci pour Homme II is the true Tea for Two for me -- but that is another story... ;-)"
Gucci pour Homme II,06/27/2019,Soap,M,13,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,23,An Old Friend,"In my mind, I have written this comment several times - now I just need to type it out.

With GPH2, what I have to say is quite short: He is an old companion, bought back in the day, not used up, given away. Silly.
10 years and 5 decants later, I got the double amount in the bottle - completely happy.

To the actual scent: it is linear and ends where it begins. I smell cherries and taste tea with milk. This seemingly simple recipe is very well executed: the composition is moderately complex and therefore remains carefree. Good for summer, good for winter - GPH2 sits on me like a second skin. This is how I want to smell. Definitely."
Gucci pour Homme II,01/05/2016,Bartträger,M,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,30,Understatement is the key,"You have a meeting or are sitting in a lecture, it doesn’t matter. In the room, Aventus, Hermès, YSL, Dior, Guerlain are floating around. The rather attractive blonde woman with a tendency towards an annoying voice and standard chic style becomes quite nervous. She would love to cling to every single neck. She is dazzled by the sillage, just as she is dazzled by many things in life. She can’t take it anymore and asks the first guy for the name of his perfume. At exactly 4:00 PM, however, it’s time to clock out, because Taff starts at 5:00 PM.
The brown-haired sensual woman, with an unusually masculine self-confidence, who is not liked by many women because she has disconnected from the girly world, enters the room. She gets along better with most men than with women. Her presence makes weak men nervous and envious female colleagues jealous. She catches a whiff of your scent as she passes by. Your eyes meet, and for 2 seconds, there is eye contact. She wants to know the name of the perfume only when she sees it in your bathroom.
Understatement. Gucci Pour Homme II."
Gucci pour Homme II,05/17/2012,Siebter,M,49,,20,The Tea King,"Ah, Gucci Pour Homme II, even the bottle gave me the feeling right after acquiring it that this bottle belongs firmly in my collection. And indeed, this fragrance quickly turned out to be the cornerstone of my collection, a fallback scent that one can always rely on - just without the aftertaste of a last resort.

For Gucci Pour Homme II makes few mistakes: the scent is distinctive and unique, pleasantly transparent and yet warm-hearted. It conveys unpretentious elegance. It is timeless.

Earl Grey fans will probably love this fragrance, as especially in the opening, the strong tea aroma playfully combines with bergamot. The first seconds are a tea explosion; initially, the tea pulls back a bit, but already provides the solid foundation present throughout the entire fragrance journey, which initially serves the bergamot and the unusually soft violet. One can enjoy this sovereign yet still spectacular opening for a good twenty minutes. It simply smells really good.

As the scent develops, the black tea returns to the forefront, this time in its pure form and not as Earl Grey. At this stage, there is quite a bit of minimalism - only a hint of cinnamon joins the tea. Both remain silent together for a while, but this silence is in a way an eloquent silence, a communal silence and by no means a communicative stiffness. Tea and cinnamon know what they have in each other.

In one point, I must disagree with the prevailing opinion here. It is often mentioned as sweet tea with milk - my nose does not attribute the sweetness to the tea, but I also have no better answer (perhaps still the violet?). The milky note also seems to me to be clearly distinct from the tea; here I confidently point to the musk, which gives Gucci Pour Homme II a pleasant warmth. Nevertheless, this fragrance is primarily clear and transparent for me. This is not a good-night tea.

In the final phase, tobacco makes its appearance, gently softening the sweet side of Gucci Pour Homme II. Here, the fragrance becomes recognizably masculine for the first time, albeit in the softest way imaginable.

Perhaps my fragrance description sounds like a boring perfume - but I want to highlight one aspect separately: Gucci Pour Homme II, despite all its everyday suitability, transparency, flattering warmth, and elegance, is a very sensual fragrance that, in my opinion, works excellently in an erotic context. This sensuality is not pornographic; it does not push, but it does demand attention from time to time. Additionally, I believe Gucci Pour Homme II has a strong unisex tendency.

The longevity and scent cloud volume of this perfume are often criticized, and indeed I had the same experience at first: three or four hours of great joy, then it was already over. At some point, I tried using a bit more (around six sprays), and now I am almost sure that the spray head of this pretty bottle simply releases a bit less than we are used to. At least since then, I have experienced a longevity that often exceeds the eight-hour mark, without having to endure a suffocating scent cloud. This is quite remarkable for such a soft and transparent fragrance.

However, this scent is quite clearly meant for warm days. Cavaradossi mentions in his comment that Gucci Pour Homme II can even develop an unexpected dynamism on hot days - then one should dose a bit more sparingly. In cooler weather, however, this fragrance remains very shy and only comes to life again within four walls.

As I said: this fragrance quickly became a reference point in my collection and also quickly became indispensable. Gucci Pour Homme II belongs to the Gucci generation of Rush, Envy, and of course Gucci Pour Homme (I), all of which are fragrances that Gucci has discontinued. The current line from Gucci is, to put it diplomatically, somewhat more palatable. It is unclear whether GPHII shares the same fate, as it can still be found in many stores (as of May 2012), and even the Gucci website informed about this fragrance during my last visit - although it was obvious that they did not want to give it the place it deserves. Whether my adrenaline spikes at the thought that I only own an additional backup bottle of this fragrance are justified, I do not know.

But it is still available, and that should be taken advantage of at least as a test by fragrance enthusiasts. Tea fans will surely enjoy this fragrance, especially and particularly female tea fans. Otherwise, there is hardly a way around Gucci Pour Homme II if you have a penchant for balanced, high-quality fragrances with a good portion of style and depth."
Gucci pour Homme II,06/12/2018,Onur95,M,8,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,11,"A very beautiful scent, but ...","I can agree with most of my predecessors, it is truly a very beautiful scent.
Upon spraying, the bergamot is immediately noticeable, and when you let the fragrance develop, I find that tobacco leaf, white musk, and myrrh become quite apparent.
What bothers me a lot about this scent is its low longevity. I have the impression that the fragrance nearly completely fades after one to two hours. Inquiries in my circle have confirmed this.
Since I still find the fragrance composition very beautiful, I always carry a small decant with me for reapplication.

Conclusion: A beautiful woody-spicy scent for summer and included in my collection despite its low longevity.

Addition:
As luck would have it, I received a sample of YSL Tuxedo, and I must say, it smells almost identical to PM II, just with much better longevity. So, anyone looking for something stronger should definitely test Tuxedo."
Gucci pour Homme II,03/07/2015,DonJuanDeCat,M,2046,,16,"You don't drink black tea, you wear it today!","Black tea as a fragrance? With some scent notes, one might first wonder if such fragrances are suitable for wearing. But when you smell it, you quickly realize that a fragrance can indeed feature different notes and still smell fantastic.

Just like here with Gucci II.
I really enjoy drinking tea, perhaps even more than the English do. Black tea is perhaps the ultimate tea in my culture. No day can start without a cup (or glass) of black tea, and throughout the day, we constantly consume tea. So often that dentists are happy when we finally get our teeth professionally cleaned to remove the deposits, to put it exaggeratively. I think it should be clear now how much I enjoy black tea.

Therefore, I often searched for fragrances with tea notes, and I found one at Gucci.
The beginning is very fresh. Upon first spray, one perceives a citrusy, almost lime-like note coming from the bergamot, which is more noticeable than the violet leaf. But then the tea makes its presence known and becomes increasingly stronger. It is a wonderful scent that indeed smells like a nice cup of tea, but not like the rather watery tasting tea bags, rather like freshly brewed tea.
Later, it becomes sweeter due to the cinnamon, but also slightly spicier, as one begins to smell the pepper (allspice). Although I do not like pepper in perfumes, this note here is very subtle and harmonizes very well with the other notes, especially with the cinnamon. Together they create a great fragrance composition. Generally, I would say that from the heart note onward, both the tea and the cinnamon/pepper scent are perceived equally. Towards the end, all these scents remain more or less intense, with the tea note slightly dominating, but a light, woody aroma also comes into play. However, I could not perceive the tobacco at all.

Of course, there is also a point of criticism. I feel that the sillage is somewhat low. I have tested it several times, but the projection could have been a bit stronger, but oh well, it's not that bad. The longevity, however, is quite good, so you are surrounded by a very pleasant fragrance all day long.
All in all, it is a beautiful, fresh scent with a nice, albeit somewhat unwieldy bottle in larger quantities. But this perfume not only smells fresh, it is also very suitable for a cozy gathering, or just for chilling, as they say.
Not only tea lovers should try this fragrance, and tea lovers should resist the temptation to want to drink the fragrance water."
Gucci pour Homme II,02/06/2014,FabianO,M,1008,,17,"Silky-fine, fresh-tea powder scent","Unusual - let's get that out of the way right from the start.

""Gucci pour homme II"" offers an exceptionally interesting, creative approach from the very beginning.

It opens with a soft freshness reminiscent of a freshly washed duvet, with notes of black tea being very prominent, really finely thematically executed, delicate and friendly, oscillating between tea sweetness and bitterness.

The violet immediately evokes a connection for me as an old ""Fahrenheit"" admirer, but the concept here is entirely different due to the black tea.

The clove pepper (Piment) quickly gains a recognizable, slightly spicy presence. Perhaps a bit too much - with clove, there is indeed a fine line between ""aesthetic"" and ""festive."" Fortunately, the cinnamon in the heart is only used very subtly.

The base comes to the forefront after about half an hour,
with slightly smoky myrrh and fresh, green-tinged tobacco leaf notes taking their position.

Overall, a lot of praise for the extremely distinctive and truly innovative fragrance concept - that one can still experience something like this in the late 00s is noteworthy, especially given the mass of cheap knock-offs, sugary bombshells, and air numbers."
Gucci pour Homme II,06/29/2016,Schücha,M,5,,15,"With Gucci PHII back to ""Tea Flavor""!","As you can already tell from the title, I am a fan of wordplay.

For a long time, I pondered which fragrance I would dedicate my second comment to in this forum, and there was simply no way around this noble scent.

Thanks to a decant from Parfumos (many thanks again to Phillytilly), I got to experience the ""tea flavor"" early this year.

I always associate tea with the beginning of my school years, as I was the youngest in my family and always preferred tea over coffee. And when there was tea in the morning, it was black tea with a little sugar. Add a delicious butter and jam sandwich, and the day could begin.

Of course, I had already formed an image of the scent here and in various forums, and it somehow fit my preferences, even though I couldn't imagine how tea would smell in a fragrance at that time.

Then the moment came - the decant was in the house, and right after the first spray, I noticed this particularly naturally smelling tea note (I can't specify the type of black tea chosen by Gucci in this scent - perhaps the more trained noses can help me with that ;)).

I am really not an expert at detecting various fragrance notes (my respect goes to those who can!), but I believe a fragrance must have something special about it.
Whether it's memories of days gone by or simply a kind of feel-good factor that a fragrance can evoke in you right away.

In any case, this fragrance does that particularly well for me, and I perceive it very clearly.
Of course, the projection of this scent is not particularly strong, but in my opinion, that makes it a classy feel-good fragrance.

You can wear the fragrance pretty much all year round, and the versatility is astonishing - aside from sports activities, I can't think of any everyday situation where you couldn't wear this scent. I am wearing it today at the office and must say, the more I wear it, the more I like it.

I am rarely approached about a fragrance in our office, but with this scent, it doesn't matter because it is a fragrance that I want to smell :)

The bottle is also impressive - classically designed in thick glass with a heavy golden plastic cap. It could easily serve as a doorstop like the Icon Dunhill bottle, but we are all too precious for that.

You can't complain about the price, especially if you use various price comparison platforms, you can always find a good deal.

All in all, I can say that this fragrance from the house of Gucci is a very special scent for me and has little to do with mainstream, as I have not yet discovered another fragrance with such a delicious tea note (Tea for Two is too spicy for me, and in Bvlgari pour Homme, the tea note was too subtle for my nose).

Hats off to the perfumer Karine Dubreuil, who hit the mark with this fragrance right in the (black) tea."

Gucci pour Homme II,08/28/2013,DieNase,F,186,,10,Earl Grey with Tobacco,"I still remember my first time - with this fragrance - very clearly. I think I hadn't read much about it and was hardly aware of the hype (especially on Basenotes). Sprayed in a small-town perfumery while on vacation and zoom! Who expects something like that - at Douglas?
My mother nodded in acknowledgment, yes, this would be something for my brother (yes, I’m sure he would love it). It would also be something for me, I thought secretly. It wouldn't leave my mind, and so I soon ordered a small bottle - unusually spontaneous for my standards (I try to avoid impulse buys). That was a mistake. I should have gone for the big bottle right away. But given the repeated rumors of discontinuation, I have now made up for it. 150 ml should be enough for now.
Enough rambling - onto the scent:

It starts off with plenty of violet leaf and Earl Grey tea. Not too dry, not too sweet, lightly spiced, simply perfect. In the drydown, a slightly dirty note comes in. It could be patchouli. But it strongly reminds me of tobacco, yes, a pronounced tobacco note. And there’s hardly more to say about it. Except that it is incredibly delicious!
Sillage is in the middle range, longevity is okay.
Aside from the fact that the violet leaf note is somewhat masculine (Fahrenheit is probably to blame), I find the fragrance quite unisex. Ladies, don't miss out on this!"

A revolution also befell the wonderfully scented Gucci Pour Homme I shortly thereafter. Or should we rather say, a complete transformation. Because Gucci II has absolutely nothing to do with its beloved predecessor. Yet both fragrances convince me in their own unique ways...

Since I have already written a comment about the ""scent twin"" Fan di Fendi Pour Homme, I would like to use my comment on Gucci II for a comparison as well.

In the top notes, the fragrances differ quite drastically. The mandarin in FdFpH transforms into a distinctly noticeable cucumber in Gucci II. Right from the start, you can already smell the much-mentioned tea note, which will not fade away throughout the entire duration (in the Fendi counterpart, it appears a bit later).

A certain spiciness can be detected in the heart note - according to the fragrance pyramid, it is likely the clove pepper combined with cinnamon (a lovely combination, as the clove pepper already has a cinnamon-like flavor!).
The tobacco in the drydown hides itself quite well to my nose, contrary to some other comments here. Also, the often described sweetness honestly doesn’t strike me as that extreme (especially in comparison to the Fendi). In my opinion, this note arises solely from the tea.

Actually, I associate tea fragrances more with something like the last evening in autumn, sitting humbly by the fireplace in the rain and wind (for example, I immediately think of Fan di Fendi). However, Gucci II is different. It has a considerable elegance that cannot be underestimated; I can definitely imagine it as an office scent as well.

I want to emphasize the cucumber note once again, which unfortunately is mentioned far too rarely but is clearly perceived by me all the way into the heart note.
All in all, Gucci has succeeded in creating a really good ""successor"" to the first one, even though the term successor is actually not fitting given the incomparability.

Revolutions at Gucci often bring positive surprises."

Unfortunately, it has been forgotten in our household for years, but I want to change that from now on.

In any case, this perfume reminds me exactly of that wonderful childhood time at my grandparents', when I would already get a cup of PG Tips tea (with a splash of UHT milk) from my grandma in bed in the morning, along with 2 slices of zwieback with butter & honey on top, which I would dip into the tea. Yes, in the end, there were probably more zwieback crumbs in the cup than tea, but it was so delicious.

Fragrances like ""Envy for Men (Eau de Toilette) | Gucci,"" ""By Man | Dolce & Gabbana,"" ""What About Adam (Eau de Toilette) | Joop!,"" or Antidote EAU DE TOILETTE are perfumes that I will never understand why they were discontinued.

I simply cannot imagine that it was due to poor sales, and the fragrance compositions themselves should still find great appeal today and are in no way outdated... But what's the point of nostalgic lamenting? I think we've all learned by now that it doesn't help :(
Gucci pour Homme II EAU DE TOILETTE is unfortunately the last great creation from Gucci for men's fragrances, in my opinion...

This scent is also one that has accompanied me the longest and would definitely be repurchased regularly if it were still in production.
After Dior Homme Intense (2011) (definitely the old version), I would probably consider this my second signature scent. The unusual combo of violet leaf, black tea, pimento, cinnamon, tobacco, and white musk creates a fantastic warm spiciness, which always carries a certain lightness.
For me, it is actually almost always wearable and nearly impossible to overapply, unless one really tries to ;)
The fact that the longevity is unfortunately a small drawback has already been mentioned here several times... but for me, it still falls within an acceptable range.

As I said, I will sadly never understand why such masterpieces are discontinued only to throw some meaningless stuff on the market that is already available in one form or another... I have unfortunately not found a truly acceptable replacement so far.

Gucci pour Homme II,12/22/2014,Unruh,M,97,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Laissez-faire,"Another blind buy, sparked by the fragrance pyramid and the comments, arrived at my place a few days ago.
After unpacking, there is the first reason for joy. The bottle is a knockout, a noble, high-quality block of solid glass with a metal cap. The light purple fragrance liquid inside adds the finishing touch.

Now to the inner values...

The opening is distinctly characterized by bergamot and violet leaf for my nose. However, very quickly the protagonist, black tea, takes center stage. This scent note is truly excellently realized here; it becomes a bit smoky-bitter and slightly floral, with a pinch of cinnamon dancing around this long-lasting main phase. Over time, this scent note fades, becoming woodier and quieter, and after a few hours, ""Gucci pour Homme II"" gently fades out without significant further scent changes, only becoming a bit sweeter. Throughout the entire time, the fragrance remains unobtrusive and close to the skin.

I agree with many comments. ""Gucci pour Homme II"" is an archetype of a relaxed, laid-back scent, which is not only due to the black tea - for me, the epitome of relaxation. However, it is a bit too relaxed for me; I need and want a bit more strictness and less indulgence in my fragrances.

But first, let’s talk about the formalities: the bottle is, quite literally, a sensation!; cubic, bulky, solid, simple yet elegant: Rating: Excellent. However, there is something I find bothersome about handling the fragrance container: the spray nozzle. Perhaps it is also due to my lack of ""craftsmanship"" or dexterity, but I struggle with the push button - at least not in the way I would prefer. It either dispenses an insufficient amount, or an ""inappropriate"" amount, or it ""spits"" - sometimes it even sprays off-target. One really has to practice with it, which is definitely worth it!
Because the fragrance more than makes up for this flaw. In all three phases of the scent development, namely top note, heart note, base note - and I want to emphasize my preference for the cinnamon that comes in later, giving it a mild and delicate sweetness - the scent is extremely pleasant and light. This subtlety, which was criticized in the comments of other ""Parfumos"" - due to the moderate sillage and longevity - I find very soothing and refreshing. Fresh is also how my nose perceives the opening, which quickly transitions into a slightly bitter tea aroma that is simply harmonious with the fresh/fresher opening. And when after a certain time - I have never timed how long it takes - the aforementioned sweetness comes in, yes, then I would count Gucci Pour Homme II among my favorites. This middle phase is incredibly good; digestible, calming, attractive, and benevolent.
The fading of this fragrance is then one last impulse of an immensely captivating subtlety, which for me is the strength of Gucci Pour Homme II: Because this subtlety is the theme of this fragrance, which I consider to be among the best. Complicated, as mentioned at the beginning, it is in this sense - also due to the spray nozzle - that it is so ""pliant"" within perception, meaning that it is sometimes there, sometimes not; due to its fleeting nature, it is difficult to identify clearly, perhaps also because it is so harmoniously composed. But this ephemeral quality is sometimes appropriate, and has often been commented on favorably; - perhaps because one does not always have to overwhelm their environment with their scent.
So much for Gucci Pour Homme II, which for me is fragrant art and a small masterpiece."
Gucci pour Homme II,09/02/2012,Knickzimt,M,102,,4,Nerve-wracker on Velvet Soles,"A gentle scent, so gentle that I almost get too much of it. ""For truly lovely gentlemen around forty,"" I thought in the first few minutes,
but by now I am increasingly aware of its creeping penetrance. I find the interplay of all the notes really beautifully conceived and executed. The composition is stately and complete, that must be said.
Only: It is too embracing for me, too clingy, too flattering. It always wants to press you against its velvet-clad chest. This is how waves of affection must smell. :) Thank you, but it's all a bit too friendly for me."

It is my favorite perfume and will always remain so. Unfortunately, the production was discontinued some time ago."

Gucci pour Homme II,03/16/2014,TheRealRG70,M,27,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,I Love GPH II,"Here’s a comment on the (for my nose) last good Gucci fragrance: Gucci pour Homme II.

Right after spraying, the scent is quite fresh, with any citrus or other fruit ingredients completely omitted. Nothing special stands out at first. But after a few minutes, it smells like a very fine blend of tobacco, tea, and cinnamon, which comes across as extremely elegant.

The very balanced mixture of individual components creates a relatively unique scent that I simply cannot get enough of for the past few years and that I still find extremely appealing.
You can also wear the fragrance in summer since it is not heavy. My preferred seasons are autumn and winter, as it suits me very well during those times.

The longevity is even above average compared to current fragrances for me. After a visit to a thermal spa with several sauna sessions and swimming, I could still perceive it well on my skin in the evening. It definitely lasts through a day at the office without any issues.

It is neither extremely sweet (like the current perfume zeitgeist of 2014) nor old-school woody/spicy; it can be worn by any age group for any occasion, yet it is still something special and for me one of the top 10 perfumes that have come to market in the last 10 years.

If YSL is too boring, Dior Homme too powdery-sweet, etc.: just give it a try before it gets discontinued (then it will become ENVY-like really expensive!)"
Gucci pour Homme II,01/28/2021,Danielmohr,M,8,,3,Best All Year Round Fragrance,"This fragrance is a true all-rounder. I think you can definitely wear it all year long. The top note exudes a relaxed atmosphere, and I have often been told that I smell very pleasant when wearing this scent. While it may not have the wow effect of some other fragrances, you also don’t always want to stand out. Sometimes it’s enough to radiate a “pleasant” scent that..."
Gucci pour Homme II,04/02/2010,Maulwurf84,M,48,,8,A Visit to the Tea Room,"Season:
The scent fits quite well in winter, but it is probably too weak for the cold season. Gucci PH 2 is also quite nice to wear in spring and on mild summer days.

Age:
I think it is suitable for all age groups.

Suitability:
Going out, dates, and romantic occasions, leisure.

Intensity/Projection/Duration:
Varies greatly, everything from 2-24 hours is possible. I believe the scent does not hold up well in cold weather. Overall, I would classify the projection as subtle to moderate.

Scent:
What does Gucci PH 2 smell like?
Answer: Imagine sitting on a warm spring day on the terrace of a café, dressed in a nice old leather jacket, sipping a cup of black tea with lots of milk and cinnamon. On the table lies a freshly opened pack of cigarettes, right next to a small bouquet of flowers.
I don’t notice much bergamot, but a sweet-floral violet note comes through strongly. The tea is clearly perceptible, as is the cinnamon. Hardly anyone mentions it, but I can distinctly smell milk, and I catch a whiff of the most beautiful leather accord I have encountered in a perfume so far. As sweet as it is on paper, GPH2 is not as sweet on the skin; the initial sweetness quickly gives way to leather and is softened at the end by tobacco, leaving a woody warm impression.

Conclusion:
Although it says Pour Homme on the bottle, the scent is clearly unisex for me, and in a very successful way. Many current fragrances have a pronounced feminine side, and even in fashion, the boundaries between the two genders often blur. Well, one can think what one wants about that, but I find that many scents (like Le Male, for example) or clothes (the glitter trash from Ed Hardy) implement this concept in a very clumsy and cheap way. Gucci, on the other hand, does not. The sweetness of the cinnamon and the floral notes (traditionally feminine) are well balanced by leather and tobacco (masculine). Gucci PH2 is one of the few fragrances that do not want to commit to a gender, which I find very well done. Another example would be Dior Homme. I once considered buying it but ultimately decided against it. Reason: the milky notes. They somehow weigh on my stomach over time (a kind of childhood trauma, I had to drink a lot of milk as a little boy, against my will). Maybe it’s not the perfect scent for me, yet I have to give it a top rating. The notes harmonize perfectly, the creation is independent and original, and it is one of the few meaningful fragrances that can cleverly combine masculine and feminine aspects."
Gucci pour Homme II,07/03/2024,WinterHood,M,1,,7,The True James Bond,"It is a scent, like its bottle: angular and sharp. Masculine and herbaceous. Heavy and light. A fragrance as fresh and free as an unobstructed view of the open sea. It doesn't matter whether it's stormy and you feel the spray on your face or the sea sparkles in the sun.

It is the hint of black tea, paired with fresh notes that the wind carries from the bergamot trees over the violet fields to you. You stand there and continue to gaze at the sea. And you want to smell just like this moment.

For me, it is the fragrance that James Bond wears. Not intrusive, but noticeable. Not Roger, not George, not Timothy, not Pierce, and not Daniel either. The scent is worn by the original: Sir Sean Connery."

Gucci pour Homme II,02/02/2013,Clyde,M,87,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,0,Tea Whisper,"What a masculine presence! The beautiful bottle alone is perfectly suited for tactile male hands; bulky, angular, hefty, and so heavy that it could easily make a guest appearance as a murder weapon in an Agatha Christie mystery.

But the contents also make men's hearts race significantly; Gucci pour Homme II is indispensable on the best-seller list while most other Guccis have remained stuck in the swamp of insignificance.

Gucci pour Homme II opens with pale blue, gray notes, and immediately a wonderful, harmonious tea accord emerges, which defines the slightly melancholic overall character.
The immediate surroundings can clearly perceive the aromatic tea note; for it is embedded in a very gentle, pleasant, and unobtrusive sillage.

However, Gucci pour Homme II also has its weaknesses; it lacks a stronger base structure, making it feel quite shallow, and one misses a bit of ""depth."" This, in turn, leads to some monotony, and I couldn't wear this scent daily for that reason.
The longevity is also a bit weak, so it is advisable to carry a small travel bottle for reapplication.

But all in all, Gucci pour Homme II is a very well-made Eau de Toilette, with weaknesses that one can gladly overlook. It is indeed a pure men's fragrance, but that doesn't mean that established women shouldn't take a chance on it."
Gucci pour Homme II,12/12/2014,Parudol,M,11,,0,Cucumber Salad,"After so many great reviews, I just had to try this scent.

It's good that it's available in every well-stocked perfume department, so I didn't have to order a sample.

The bottle: Elegant and heavy. It doesn't convey a cozy warmth, like the Dior Homme Intense bottle does. But it looks straightforward and high-quality.

The scent: Well, how should I describe it? When I took my first deep breath, it reminded me of cucumber salad. Some will now shake their heads in horror and refer to the fragrance pyramid. Yes, I know. But it somehow reminded me of Grandma's delicious cucumber salad, which was served at every celebration.
No question - I enjoy eating it often, but I wouldn't want to smell like it.

In the base note, the black tea clearly comes through. It (the scent) feels different, unusual, and mysterious. However, I still can't warm up to it (even after hours).

Conclusion: Undoubtedly a very well-made, extraordinary fragrance - but not for me."
Gucci pour Homme II,08/16/2014,Duftfan,M,40,,3,Very Pleasant,"I took the plunge and bought Gucci Pour Homme II blind, as it is highly rated on Parfumo.

Gucci pour Homme II,07/26/2022,Lindener,M,1,,1,Pimento Doesn't Work,"If the pimento weren't so dominant, it could have become one of my favorite scents, especially because of the tea. It starts off bitterly fresh with the bergamot, and the tea soon comes through. I love tea aromas in perfumes; the cinnamon caresses everything, beautiful and unusual, but gradually the clove aroma of the pimento breaks through, which annoyed me and actually gave me a headache. Instead of enjoying the scent, I was constantly on high alert. The people around me found it very good."
Gucci pour Homme II,01/04/2016,Naimie54,M,115,,1,Tea for Me,"A few weeks ago, I received a larger package of fragrance samples from Mondhexe.
Thank you once again for that.
Included was Gucci pour Homme II.
The fragrance opens with a very nice bergamot note. Soon, a slight hint of pimento joins in, which is increasingly supported by the scent of a good black tea. After about 30 minutes, a slightly smoky, subtly sweet note adds to the tea scent in the heart, which is complemented by a soft musk after about an hour, while the sweet note recedes. This lightly smoky tea fragrance is gently interrupted by a soft spiciness over the next six hours until it finally fades away.
Gucci pH II is a fine, understated fragrance that is likely best worn in spring or autumn. It is not for my watch list, but rather goes on my wish list."
Gucci pour Homme II,09/01/2025,Rene92,M,4,,3,"Long Forgotten, Now Rediscovered","Forgotten for years, now rediscovered!
I wore this wonderful fragrance 15 years ago. Now, while tidying up my collection, I found an unopened, nearly unused bottle in my closet. Rediscovered for me. It was a gift from my parents, and for a long time, it went unnoticed, making me all the happier to enjoy the scent again. For a while, I couldn't ""smell"" it anymore, which is why it remained neglected for so long. Now that it is no longer available for purchase, I almost regret that I will probably never get my hands on it again. All the more I enjoy every spray now!

It smells like tea, both elegant and masculine. Yet, it is not too overpowering. The scent lasts incredibly long on me, often 6-8 hours. It is suitable for everyday office wear as well as for a nice dinner.

The bottle is heavy, angular, and has a timeless appearance.

It's a shame that the end is in sight..."
Gucci pour Homme II,06/17/2010,Maieronfire,M,9,,3,Dreamy,"I was initially captivated by the presentation: The contrast between this chunky cube bottle and the playful, dreamy violet (violet as a top note for a men's perfume is quite bold and unusual!).

It smells simply delicious, you want to keep sniffing it. However, I feel that it is relatively weak. You can handle three decent sprays without smelling like an entire perfume store!

In the top note, alongside the aromas described above, scents of fresh hay and woodruff (coumarin) explode, as well as fruity notes, like apricot and banana, which also carry into the heart note, reminding me of gingerbread and incense.

I don't find it very herb-spicy, rather sweet. As I said, it's a great scent, but I'm not so sure how a man would come across wearing it!?"
Gucci pour Homme II,10/31/2010,Friendchild,M,112,,3,"Super bottle, like every one from Gucci","So I tested the fragrance a few years ago and was about to buy it, but never did.
Right now, I'm looking for something more for leisure, a versatile scent that doesn't annoy my surroundings too much.
Then this Gucci Pour Homme 2 came to mind again, which I had already tested before, and recently again, and I must say, I still really like it. It smells very fresh and the tea scent is very present in my nose.
It is truly an incredible fragrance, as it doesn't follow the common standard but is something different in the perfume world ;) I'm starting to really like it and I'm considering buying it, but after all your comments, I'm afraid that the scent really doesn't last, and I wish for a fragrance that truly lasts longer ;)

Otherwise, the scent is really genius and is truly something special."
Gucci pour Homme II,11/12/2014,JimKnopf,M,26,,2,"Light, Fresh-Spicy Feel-Good Fragrance","I received Gucci pour Homme II through a sharing to try out (Thank you, Eichkater), as a test seems almost mandatory given the previous comments here. Although a decent pinch of pepper initially hits my nose with this fragrance, this blend with black tea and cinnamon and the other ingredients develops into an interesting, light, and refined scent. If a men's fragrance can manage to spread a light cheerfulness and an everything-is-okay vibe, then it must be this one. There is nothing ostentatious, macho, or intrusive here; rather, GPH II is a very fine and subtle feel-good scent. I also appreciate that it comes across as natural to my sense of smell, in contrast to some concoctions on the market that smell too much like artificial lab products.

With its light, spicy-fresh feel-good character, GPH II bears a certain resemblance to my beloved Baldessarini EdC Concentrée. They are certainly not scent twins, but I would describe Baldessarini as an older cousin of Gucci; especially in the drydown, a kinship becomes apparent. In the heart note, GPH II is significantly spicier, so I still prefer the overall rounder and slightly more balanced Baldessarini just a bit more. That's good, as it seems to be worn less frequently."
Gucci pour Homme II,06/28/2013,Wolf,M,18,,4,Hot Tea for Sunny Days,"But do you really want to smell like a glass of lightly sweetened, herb-spicy-cinnamon chai latte and Earl Grey? Yes! Definitely!! Because this one is so delicious, with slightly floral aromas and a bitter tea flavor, that you (at least I) want to keep sniffing myself. A great scent that is anything but ordinary or mainstream. It smells delicious, warm, and spicy, but thanks to bergamot and violet leaf, it is also refreshing, invigorating, and a bit cool. Somehow masculine, but in a reserved, likable way. Not a loudmouth or a dominant male; rather the quieter, sexy type from the second row. Sensual and stylish, but also casual and suitable for leisure.
For me, it’s a wonderful summer scent that I absolutely love and can wear both at the office and in my free time, especially during the day. Somehow, it doesn’t really fit my idea of evening wear. On the other hand: If I feel like it, I’ll wear it then too.
The only downside, in my opinion, is the mediocre longevity. At least on my skin, it fades after about 4-5 hours. On fabric, it lasts significantly longer. Therefore, I usually give an extra spritz on my shirt or T-shirt. Otherwise, there’s only one solution: reapply.
However, I don’t always crave marathon scents that you can still smell after the next shower. So, the moderate staying power on the skin can sometimes be an advantage."
Gucci pour Homme II,11/27/2009,Muenchner,M,49,,2,Good Scent,"A good scent that, while certainly not on par with my two favorite perfume manufacturers (Tom Ford (Private Blend!!) Creed), still ranks among the best that the mass market has to offer.
I find it has a nice masculine spicy and tobacco-like scent (is that a word?).
It doesn’t develop as wonderfully while wearing as some high-quality Eau de Parfums, but it smells really good right from the start.
I would recommend this scent especially to younger people, around my age (18-20) and students.
Furthermore, since the scent is not overpowering but still lasts long on the skin, you can't go wrong with applying it, and it’s not a fragrance that divides people into two camps but rather a simple good scent that almost everyone likes and doesn't offend anyone.
The price is also reasonable if you order it like I did on eBay (100ml + 200ml shower gel = €50)."
Gucci pour Homme II,12/30/2012,Coretwin,M,7,,1,With Style and Charm,"GPH II was the first perfume I bought with the criterion ""I want to smell something more extraordinary on my skin""... and that's exactly how I ended up with GPH II after quite a bit of testing strips and wrist sniffing.
The characteristically spicy-cinnamon, yet wonderfully warm-soft scent immediately convinced me. Definitely one of my favorite perfumes for the colder season and fancier evening events.
Although I don't receive nearly as many compliments for it as I do with more ""everyday suitable"" and more widespread fragrances (e.g. Boss Bottled), it is one of the scents that I personally love to smell on myself. And that is, to some extent, what it's all about, I would say :)"
Gucci pour Homme II,02/01/2023,Dimitry,M,26,,1,"The sun begins to warm, the snow is already gone, and the buds on the trees are already swollen and...","Hello everyone!

This perfume was bought a long time ago, to be honest, I don't remember its price,
First of all, I liked the square, clear, glass, and very heavy bottle; it is so heavy that it could really kill.

The cap of the bottle is heavy and made of gold-colored, textured metal.

It is a masculine scent, although I think it would also suit girls, and belongs to the group of woody, spicy fragrances. It was released in 2007.

Top notes: violet leaf and bergamot.

Heart notes: cinnamon, red pepper, and black tea.

Base notes: olive wood, musk, tobacco leaf, and myrrh.

A fragrance for the young, ambitious man. I think spring is the best time for this perfume, when the sun begins to warm, the snow has fallen, and the buds on the trees are already swollen and slowly budding. When nature awakens and the song of the birds echoes through the city. You walk in a light jacket to meet your friend who has just arrived from a faraway country, you are in a good mood and happy.

For me, the first notes of this perfume are green, violet leaf, and olive tree; I don't hear bergamot at all. The initial notes don't last long, then follow notes of myrrh and cherry, which are not mentioned in the fragrance description, and you realize that it is not cherry at all, but pipe tobacco, so warm, masculine, and pleasant, with a slight sweetness. The rest is a subtle scent of olive wood, green and delicate. This is where the scent of this perfume ends. Unfortunately, the longevity is not good for me at all; it lasts only 2-3 hours, sits close to the skin, and leaves almost no trace.

I liked the scent, but unfortunately, it fades very quickly, so I give it a solid 3.

Springtime
Pleasant
Cons:
Not long-lasting"
Gucci pour Homme II,10/18/2010,Romano1985,M,5,,1,Somewhat frivolous.....,"I have bought this fragrance 3 times already, the intensity could be stronger, but I find it very sexy, although for the average guy it might be too sexy and too bold.... It suits me personally well, it sometimes comes across as very animalistic and provocative on me with undertones of fresh sweat, as I perceive it, also a bit of smoke and leather seem to emerge.... Very successful, and not mainstream at all....."
Gucci pour Homme II,04/21/2012,Fleurissimo,M,323,,1,Summer in the City,"Do you know this feeling: Sometimes you try a fragrance in a situation that fits the scent so perfectly that you associate the fragrance with that moment? This happened to me when I first sniffed ""Gucci pour Homme II."" It was a dry, hot, windless summer day in Frankfurt. And in the fragrance, I recognized all the impressions of my surroundings: There was the overheated, bitter spiciness of the scent (pepper and nutmeg), softened by a green note reminiscent of the smell of the gray asphalt, which was not carried away by any breeze and only made bearable by the greenery of the plane trees, the strictly animalistic note that found its counterpart in the sweat of passersby, and there was the cosmopolitan elegance of the metropolis, reflected in the complexity of the fragrance.

I do not consider ""Gucci pour Homme II"" to be a ""completely different"" fragrance from the masses - rather, I see it as one with a certain class and urban flair, less catchy than ""Gucci pour Homme I,"" but that doesn't have to be a disadvantage."
Gucci pour Homme II,12/01/2011,Bullitt,M,85,,0,Then I'd rather go for POUR HOMME I...,"I already had the brilliant GUCCI POUR HOMME and of course wanted to get this nice neighbor as well...

Here I noticed a somewhat special experience and development within myself... At first, I actually found it quite okay, but after wearing it several times, the scent really started to annoy me over time...

I don't know why, but probably the black tea didn't work very well for me, as this note is quite prominent!

I have to give it to him, he is, like his older brother, unique and thus surely a great scent. Moreover, it lasts quite long on me, but unfortunately, it doesn't please my nose very much... :-/

Gucci Intense Oud,09/07/2016,Rmf1112,M,17,,8,Very Pleasant Everyday Oud,"Just tried it and I get a bunch of frankincense-oud with leather and resins. I think it's really nice and actually prefer it to Versace Oud Noir. I think the Versace is too soapy, and this is a bit darker but not heavy. Initial impression is very good, I could see wearing this often. It is different from most, it has a slight warmth from the resins, and it is well blended. I am getting great sillage, fairly strong at arms length, but just lovely. It has a nice powdery oud, which is smooth and elegant. I am quite pleased with this.

While I appreciate input and opinions, I am very glad I blind bought this, despite suggestions to the contrary. It may not be groundbreaking, but it is pleasant, a bit mysterious, and different. I don't know much about synthetics, but it smells nice, thats all I know, or care about.

Initial impressions

Scent - 9.5
Sillage - 8.5
Longevity- 8.5 (8-12 hours)
Bottle - 9.5 - that doorknocker cap is so damn pleasing

Will fit nicely in my top 3 with Montale Greyland and Bentley Absolute."
Gucci Intense Oud,08/31/2022,BobbyGee,M,230,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Gucci / Gucci Intense Oud,"A very decent perfume and it attracts attention. The best Gucci since the times of GPH and GPH II (in my opinion), although from the interesting experiences of this stable there is definitely the Gucci Absolute.
The fragrance of Intense Oud is very persistent with good projection, but not much. After comparing similar fragrances (about 12 oud) - on blotters and body - similar notes to Tom Ford (Oud Wood) and Versace (Oud Noir). Quality of ingredients better than Versace and longer design. The smell is nicer to the nose than the typical dark agar smells due to the breakage of the smell of a fresh pear.
So here we have agar and wood notes and incense and leather and this fruity freshness. The scent is therefore not very strong and dark, but smooth and balsamic in reception.
Solid work and very pleasant to receive. I recommend to all who like the fragrances of the above. In my opinion, it is worth interchangeable with, for example, Oud Wood. When it comes to the amount and durability - it's worth it. If someone would like to save a little and do not want to spend money on a whole bottle of Tom Ford or that Gucio - I recommend Versace."
Gucci Intense Oud,07/23/2024,Adrian18233,M,42,,3,Arguably one of the best oud perfumes on the market,"Arguably one of the best oud perfumes on the market. Its dark and mysterious leans more on the mature gentleman side than a unisex fragrance. The oud note in this one is well tamed. A fine fragrance indeed one that turns heads. A germ from Gucci.

Great performance, massive, exclusive, simply charismatic, powerful, compelling and a compliments galore. It smells great and will make you feel like a million bucks.

Really nice fragrance that brings an appealing scent together with dark elements into harmony. That is where niche sometimes goes wrong for me.. They get too dark or it ends up just smelling like burnt ash or camel anus.. This is a good one. Smokey, woody, some light sweetness.. bold and a good performer."
Gucci Intense Oud,02/04/2022,Wilfredo,M,17,,3,GUCCI OUD INTENSE,"Not a very great oud, but very easy to like. It's very strong tho. So 2 sprays must be enough. This is the typical rose/oud western oud scent. I have tried to love it, but it never got to more than Like. This kind of perfumes is very cloying, and not easy on the nose. I can't imagine how anyone would wear Oud in warm weather. I can see it work well in winter tho. Just not for me"
Gucci Intense Oud,06/08/2024,Smirky,M,483,,3,Oud that isn't Oud,"I have mixed thoughts on this one. Intense Oud has a pleasant scent that strikes me as down the middle unisex - not leaning masculine nor feminine. The actual oud note seems to be pretty minimal or subtle, especially after the dry down. It's more of a fruity/floral mix with oud/patchouli. Scent is pretty mild and crowd pleasing.

Previously, I had recommended 1 Million Golden Oud as a mild oud introduction. The oud there starts out stronger than Intense Oud and after dry down has a pretty powerful leather note that continues to push the fragrance along. Intense Oud will be my new mild ""introduction to oud"" recommendation.

As you can probably guess from these comments, Intense Oud is too mild, subtle, floral and unisex for my taste. I want something that makes a stronger statement.

Intense Oud's performance is quite good however."

Not my favourite direction for a oud based scent, but that fact does not weaken its artistic effort and brave proposition.

Very suitable if you like perfumes with oud touches (synthetic one in this case, obviously) going in the aromatic/green direction"
Gucci Intense Oud,06/23/2025,Loubacca64,M,70,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,Gucci high stepping into the Niche realm.,"I've had this fragrance for about 2-3 years now & everytime I pull it out for a sniff, I say ""why don't I wear this more"". The reason being, you don't just wear this fragrance anywhere. It's not an everyday fragrance. This fragrance is classy, masculine & isn't offensive, surprisingly.....
.
When you first spray this you get a nice dose of raspberry, rose & spice from the saffron & it's all within this beautiful cloud of Oud that is just so smooth. I believe it's the combination of the orange blossom that helps keep it at bay & not so aggressive. Because if you know Oud, it can really be an in your face, fragrance. That can come off as dirty, super Smokey & obviously woody. Most frag houses will always combine rose & oud with saffron but with this fragrance that's not all you get here & that's also very nice, & separates this fragrance from like a More Than Words, Join the Club by Xerjoff.
.
This fragrance I feel really is an all year round fragrance. Amazingly it does work in summer, AT NIGHT. I definitely would NEVER wear this in the day time unless to like a wedding in the fall/winter. It's very situational, & rather than wear this to say the store or running errands. This is a fragrance you're wearing to show you have taste/class, so weddings, dinner dates, night outs, etc.
Lasts for hours, probably 8-9 hours, projects for about 2 hours or so & when it turns into a skin scent, still very present. That seems very intentional, considering this fragrance doesn't project very loud in the first place. Probably about a foot or two of projection.
.
It's definitely a masterpiece in its own right, Gucci's masterpiece. Because I dnt consider any of their fragrance nearly as great as this one & for good reason. Gucci isn't very consistent with their fragrances. They're ok, but nothing too crazy, inspiring or worth mentioning in most instances.
It's def more niche than anything else they've done. & it's an easy blind buy, for anyone over the age of 26 going into the 30s. A mature young person may love it but either way, happy hunting!"
Gucci Intense Oud,01/16/2020,MikeMike,M,39,,3,"Excuse me, sir, what kind of liquid do you have in your e-cigarette?","Smoking is not allowed here.

I don't have a comparison to base variant Gucci Oud but in an intense version is opening very, very sweet for me. Main notes that dominate raspberry with also reminds me of a bit of wild cherry, unfortunately, there is not much more behind it - oud, amber is underdeveloped.
With for me make it is as Gucci Oud Intense is missing something, I would like to break it with some woody, smokey notes.

To be honest it reminds me of fruit-flavored liquids that I sense from time to time from people smoking an e-cigarette. Raspberries/Cherries with a hint of tobacco.

For me, it is too linear, too simple and in some way to sweet, even if fruits notes are definitely more on darker/wilder side.

It could be a great accompaniment for a younger audience and can act as a women scent with a few male notes."

Gucci Intense Oud,09/26/2025,Medkhalil,M,1,,1,A designer fragrance with niche quality,"I was passing by one of the Marionnaud Paris branches and decided to try Gucci Oud Intense. I’m not a fan of oud fragrances, but this one shocked me with the quality of the oud and how well it blends with the other notes.
When you first spray it, you get a beautiful burst of cranberry, rose , and saffron spice, all wrapped in a very smooth oud cloud.

I feel this fragrance works well in all seasons, and amazingly, it even performs beautifully in summer but only at night.

I never expected that I could buy a designer fragrance with niche quality, and what’s even crazier is that it costs only $125! It was truly insane. I highly recommend it, and it’s definitely a safe blind buy because everyone will love it."

Gucci Intense Oud,10/31/2019,Benedikt2019,M,96,,37,-----The Mass Market Appeal------,"I have had the fragrance described above in my possession for some time now, even though I don't usually care much for heavy oud scents. On the contrary, they usually get on my nerves at some point. And I swear to you: I have tried almost all of them! I've gone through the Atkinsons, the Laytons, the M7, the Creeds, and even the most dreadful one under the sun, Oud Satin Mood (sticky, disgusting, overpowering, like chewing gum). And I thought I would never learn to love an oud fragrance and be able to add one to my collection, until it entered my life: Gucci - Intense Oud. Just by the name, I thought to myself, this can't be good. Intense and oud? Well, I was proven wrong. Due to the many great reviews, I decided to test it. Luckily. Because what I got is, for me, the most wearable oud fragrance I have tested so far. Let me explain:

Oud Intense is intense, but not in terms of the oud. It is rather fresh-spicy-woody, with the spicy notes lingering more in the background. It also has a slightly fruity touch from pear, raspberry, and orange, which I would not describe as particularly strong. The oud is, of course, also well noticeable, but wonderfully smoothed out by patchouli, amber, and musk. So it is nicely restrained. Where this freshness kick comes from, I do not know. Perhaps from the rose? I leave this analysis to the fragrance pyramid professionals. Besides the freshness, I also perceive a slightly pleasantly bitter, minimal graphite-like note.

In summary, this oud fragrance can be described as a young, slightly fresh-bitter oud scent that is very mass-appealing and straightforward in its progression. The wearer does not need to be dressed in a suit. A shirt, a nice sweater, or a polo shirt is sufficient. It is also suitable for those looking for a very strong but not extreme autumn-winter scent. The longevity for me is between 8-10 hours, and it is almost perceivable up to a meter away until the end. The bottle fits as well. It is elegantly crafted and appears valuable. Price-wise, it is my clear favorite. It costs between 75-90 euros for 90ml, and no other house can compete with that. Therefore, for me, it's a clear 10.

It is unsuitable if you expect a complex masterpiece like the Laytons or Atkinsons. It also would not suit you if you need the full oud blast. And unfortunately, I would ultimately stand against the unisex label. For me, it is a 100% men's fragrance.

P.S.: It has proven its mass appeal by being the most positively commented fragrance in my collection. Even strangers have complimented me on it. Some users are indeed interested in such experiences.

Clear test recommendation,
Your Bene :)"

Gucci Intense Oud,04/15/2016,FLUidENTITY,M,246,,9,A Play-Doh Note,"So, now I will take a look at this somewhat neglected fragrance. Certainly, Gucci has played with its trust in being perceived as a major label that understands the art of perfume, with numerous rather unremarkable flankers. Many large top notes dissipate, a significant portion of the budget is funneled into advertising, marketing is emphasized, and the quality of the fragrances sometimes suffers. Nevertheless, it is worth delving into this Intense Oud.

It took a long time for the bottle to find its way to the shelf; I finally came across IO at Oberpollinger. The bottle is well-known, designed in simple black in accordance with an Oud Intense, featuring a golden cap. Even though the bottle has already been seen with Made to Measure, pour Homme, and pour Homme Sport, it is still not unattractive.

This Oud, like its predecessor Oud, did not emerge entirely in a vacuum. While Oud points towards Dark Saphir by Agonist and Black Aoud by Montale, here we find influences from Armani's Bois d'Encens and Encens Satin. The incense and leather, which are initially presented in a dusty, dry guise, reveal a certain roughness. However, this quickly shifts towards much softer realms.

A certain Play-Doh note begins to spread, enveloping the leather and the dry wood. Black Cube and Splendid Wood also possess a bit of this unique Play-Doh note; in my opinion, it is a specific one, as both of these fragrances feature incense and oud, just like Gucci's IO. In Black Cube, amber is also part of the mix, just like here. This combination, when the appropriate facets of eagle wood and incense are used, becomes very smooth, which here is made a bit duller, blunter, broader, and softer by the leather. From this point on, one wants to sink into the fragrance and snuggle into its intense yet always soft power. Once the leather has spread in its soft potency, one tends to see the fragrance walking in the footsteps of Stercus.

To perhaps clarify this Play-Doh note further: if one were to express it harshly, it is even somewhat musty, but this note is so dense, deep, dull, and soft that it remains quite independent when considered on its own and makes a great impression."
Gucci Intense Oud,06/27/2020,Salva,M,77,,17,Finally a wonderful Gucci!,"Hello friends,

some time ago, when I discovered my first Oud fragrance with Santal Royal and was immediately smitten, I let my emotions guide me and shortly after looked for the next treasure that contained this note.

However, I can’t quite remember how I stumbled upon Gucci Intense Oud. It must have been purely by chance here on Parfumo... You know how it is, you inevitably come across fragrances here that you’ve never heard of before... And so it was - I think - with this one as well.
[...]

I hadn’t really been able to connect with Gucci fragrances until now and found all the ones I had tested - to be honest - quite dreadful and sometimes even repulsive. Normally, I associate this Italian fashion house with some adult wannabe millionaires (maybe they are; good for them) or little “rich kids” who try to make the streets unsafe in certain big cities here with - in my opinion - bizarre and horrible clothes, shoes, or accessories from this brand, along with their flashy cars, without realizing how ridiculous these randomly assembled “garments” actually look (Yes, fashion is of course a matter of taste; but in my eyes, these things just look silly!) Sorry, that’s my opinion.
[...]

Anyway, back to the fragrance itself. I looked at the notes, which I found very promising and enticing at first glance.
“Pear and raspberry? Mmm, sounds interesting and delicious,” I thought first.
“Rose and orange blossom? Sounds like floral undertones, should appeal to me,” I was pleased with the heart note.
“Patchouli, amber, musk, and OUD? Oh yes, if that’s not a great base!” I was quite euphoric and taken with it.

However, the fragrance pyramid had a tiny flaw: saffron! Yes, saffron, the supposedly most valuable spice in the world (at least that’s the common opinion among experts). I had never smelled this note in a fragrance before and had no idea how it actually smells. So I started to ponder a bit and had minimal concerns, but I’ll come back to this in a moment...

Additionally, I read some reviews and watched a few YT videos... So I ordered a decant here in the Souk about 1.5 months ago.
[...]

When the decant arrived at home, I was of course very curious and hoped so much not to be disappointed. Because I particularly had the saffron note in mind...
I sprayed my wrists and at first, a bitter, sour, and slightly spicy cloud of fragrance wafted into my nose... “Hmm, is this the saffron note? Probably,” I answered my own question. Because I didn’t perceive the pear and raspberry at first. But my intuition confidently urged me to wait, and I just trusted my gut feeling, which whispered to me: “Give it time, it’s just starting... It will develop...”

As the fragrance progresses, it indeed shows its great class! The somewhat unpleasant saffron for my nose fades after just a few minutes, and the fruity-delicious combination of pear & raspberry joins in. Due to the rose and orange blossom, the fragrance becomes slightly floral-sweet almost in the same breath, which I really like. The woody touch comes from patchouli and amber, but the oud note is prominent here and is, in my opinion, dominant.
[...]

When the temperatures were significantly cooler compared to these days, I often used my decant and subsequently ordered a bottle. Because I just find it very good!
On my skin, it lasts about 6-7 hours, and the sillage is quite enveloping in the first 3 hours. After that, it can still be smelled directly on the skin.

Conclusion:
In my eyes, this Gucci is a really great and wonderful oud fragrance with slightly sweet tendencies in the background. Despite the somewhat sour and bitter saffron at the beginning for my nose, I find it excellent, as it gets better over time due to its dynamic development. In my opinion, it is best suited for the colder seasons (autumn/winter), and I would prefer it in the evening; however, it can certainly also be worn during the day on cold days, which I will do... :)
It comes across, like most oud fragrances, quite “mature” and I think it’s ideal for men who like to dress classically and elegantly.

For me personally, this is the best Gucci fragrance for men! Although it is marketed as unisex, in my opinion, it is not at all; I can only really imagine it on men. But everyone has to find that out for themselves...

So if you are looking for a great oud fragrance for “Western noses,” you should definitely give this one a try (if you haven’t already). The price-performance ratio is excellent and absolutely convincing; I was able to purchase the 90ml bottle at Notino for €54. And according to the information here, it is discontinued; so don’t waste any time and grab a bottle if you like it ;)

And I thank each and every one of you for reading!

Best regards"
Gucci Intense Oud,04/06/2022,Moonwalker88,M,4,,15,Mysterious Magic,"Thanks to the souk and the help of many friendly perfume enthusiasts, I had the pleasure of trying some scents that I might never have encountered otherwise.
One of my greatest discoveries is Gucci Intense Oud. For me, it's a masterpiece from the world of designer fragrances.

I have never tried a ""real"" oud fragrance, as I have reservations about overly animalic/medicinal scent notes.
All the more, I am glad that the name ""Intense Oud"" did not deter me from sampling it in this case.
Pear, raspberry, saffron, rose, oud: that sounded intriguing.
And so I was eager to test the fragrance based on a sample.

Upon the first sniff, I was immediately captivated. This scent was simply different from all my previous ones: an alluring oriental temptation with a depth that enchanted me.

Gucci Intense Oud is excellent for special occasions or evenings out (on cooler days), but also perfectly suitable for the office or everyday wear.
You don't need to apply much. The longevity is above average.
I personally enjoy this scent on myself and feel enveloped by a mysterious & seductive aura when wearing it.

The price-performance ratio (around €75 for 90 ml) is very good in my opinion: you get an elegantly appealing and high-quality designer fragrance that stands out significantly from many others.

The bottle is also visually appealing and conveys an elegant impression that matches its contents.

Speaking of designer oud: I also tested ""Versace pour Homme Oud Noir | Versace."" However, this one fell short of my expectations. It unfortunately offers weak performance and pales in comparison to GIO.
I also tried the very popular Oud Wood EAU DE PARFUM: a good scent, but here too, I prefer Gucci.

Conclusion: Gucci Intense Oud is definitely worth a test and a shining example of the magic of fragrances ;)"
Gucci Intense Oud,05/01/2021,FeineNase84,M,2,,12,Pure Sensuality,"He entered my life as a sample and stayed.
When I smelled the first spray on my wrist, I was already smitten.
It awakened something in me.
Simply magical. Slightly smoky and sweet but truly magically attractive. It made me so addicted that the sample was empty within 3 days.
I decided to order a 90ml bottle of Gucci Intense Oud.
However, I was sure that there were too many fakes circulating online. I opted for a Gucci store in Munich, where they told me that the fragrance would soon be discontinued and that’s why it had arrived at the outlet. They gave me a number for an outlet in Ingolstadt.
Since I was offered the 90ml bottle for 100 euros instead of the regular 150, I bought 3 bottles right away.

Back to the fragrance.

It is very seductive.
Not too sweet and not too dark (oud)
I would wear it more in autumn/winter for going out.
But you could also wear it on a cool summer evening.
Definitely very elegant and well-suited for entering the oud world."
Gucci Intense Oud,12/19/2020,Felixvflx,M,6,,9,Gucci in a different way,"In my opinion, the fact that the brand Gucci now has a rather negative reputation also affects the fragrances, and I always assumed that the scents would be less individual and more made for the masses.
Through Parfumo, I came across this fragrance, but I couldn't find a perfume store where I could test it.
Due to the good reviews and the notes that appealed to me very much, I decided to make a blind purchase. I was not disappointed.
It does not smell synthetic and has fantastic longevity and sillage.
I personally don't really perceive the scent after 2 or 3 hours, but it has happened several times that I couldn't smell it anymore, yet I was still approached about it, with the words ""expensive"" and ""very individual"" often being mentioned.
In this price segment (around €65 on Notino), I believe there is hardly a better fragrance.
A full recommendation to buy!"
Gucci Intense Oud,03/13/2021,DonDampa,M,1,,9,I love this scent,"In short, this scent is amazing.

Floral, it envelops you with a smoky background that makes it so masculine.
Women love the scent because it smells sweet yet assertively masculine. A man exudes a certain dominance or self-confidence. Probably also because it lasts forever. On clothes, you can smell it until the next wash!!!!

Women over 30 can also wear it without hesitation. It is elegant and sweet enough. But thanks to the smoky background, it's not for younger ones.
It suits a darker type better, in my opinion.

I have found an absolute fragrance twin for those who prefer it less smoky and sweeter: Ajmal 10001 Nights. I use the oil for my wrist in combination. I’ve been told that people would like to bite my hand off?

This scent is my absolute favorite.
Whether for a date, club, or dinner, it fits almost every occasion.

However, I will skip it for the office and summer."
Gucci Intense Oud,09/11/2023,Matti64,M,2,,11,Nomen != Omen,"When it comes to oud fragrances, I tend to be skeptical to averse; I don't like this often-praised ""animalistic"" note, and then there's ""Intense Oud.""

No thanks. Hm, but it comes from Gucci. Of course, Gucci is also known for extravagance, but you can still give it a try; it's not a niche fragrance. They must pay some attention to their customer base.

And that's exactly how it is.

Gucci Internes Oud is anything but what the name suggests. The opening is quite strong, and you do get a certain oud note in your nose, but fortunately, that fades quickly, and in the heart, there is a beautiful, balanced, robust-spicy note with a slight oriental touch. The whole thing feels very elegant and masculine.

The projection is good, but it doesn't fill entire halls, so it's not a ""beast mode"" or ""sillage monster."" You are noticed, but I haven't felt that people around me would rather flee or want to open a window.

Here too, Gucci has done everything right.

A really well-made robust-spicy, slightly oriental fragrance that can be worn on many occasions."
Gucci Intense Oud,08/20/2019,Mischa99,M,115,,5,Alleged Women's Fragrance,"Lovers of rosy scents will surely like Gucci Intense Oud. However, I would rather classify the rose as ""intense."" The rose scent lingers for several hours, which was too much for me. The fragrance reminded me more of my grandmother, who used to wear Bulgarian rose. The raspberry was quite noticeable at the beginning, which I think is not suitable for a ""unisex fragrance."" However, the oud was always present with the typical chemical scent in the background. I would have liked to smell something more animalistic here; it all felt rather chemically sterile. As a base note, the oud was still clearly noticeable in the end.
Unfortunately, not a fragrance for me."
Gucci Intense Oud,01/02/2022,Salamanazar,M,2,,2,Two Face Harvey Dent (Batman),"I have had my eye on this fragrance for a long time and wasn't quite sure if it was worth a blind buy. In the end, I went for it and would like to share my experience:

I am a big Batman (Christopher Nolan) fan and think that the scent perfectly matches Harvey Dent Two Face. Why? It starts off relatively fruity / similar to TF OW and after about 2 hours shifts to the completely opposite extreme of the spectrum to BA. On one side, there is the very friendly and warm aspect, and on the other, this brutal dark facet that this fragrance brings with it.
Unfortunately, I am not a BA fan, as this scent actually makes me feel nauseous, and I find it a shame that it doesn't completely follow this friendly and warm manner.

Worth a blind buy? No, definitely not, please test it beforehand and take your time to experience the entire fragrance journey.

Gucci Intense Oud,12/26/2023,MetalMania,M,4,,6,Successfully Established,"In my rather limited bottle ""collection,"" this wonderful fragrance will soon join. Successfully established against Emporio Armani - Stronger With You Oud and the unfortunately fleeting Polo Oud (which will have to join sooner or later :P)
Rose generally gets on my nerves, but here it works and stays more in the background. Overall, it's a rather subtle Oud scent that has definitely caught my attention :)"
Gucci Intense Oud,12/11/2022,Jhunas,M,7,,4,First and probably last Oud fragrance,"I bought Gucci Intense Oud as my first and probably last Oud fragrance. Since I didn't own any Oud fragrance yet, it was a logical step for me to get one. Having read that it is supposed to be discontinued, I took the plunge with a blind buy under the motto ""Now or Never!"".
Upon the first sniff, I could detect the pear in the top note, along with a very sour note. I didn't quite like it. I had also read that this one is not supposed to smell as medicinal as other Oud fragrances. Although I haven't tested any others, so I can't make a comparison, over time it had a slight medicinal note for me, mixed with something quite animalistic, almost like sweat. I found it terrible. Others have told me that it doesn't smell that bad, but I still felt uncomfortable with it.
I once had a small discussion with a colleague about the smell of a customer after the customer had left the store. I was firmly convinced that the gentleman had a very strong body odor, but my colleague told me it was a fragrance. This scent reminds me exactly of that smell, which is why I now know my colleague was right. I really lack the imagination to find a situation in which this fragrance would be appropriate. Maybe it's just because of my young age (20), perhaps I will come to appreciate such a fragrance later. However, I cannot recommend this scent at the moment, especially not for young people."

Gucci Intense Oud,02/20/2022,Mo2dimes,M,11,,2,Complicated,"Admittedly, I find it difficult to write a detailed review. I am relatively new to the world of fragrances, which might explain my confusion. Perhaps it is simply the scent that leaves my nose puzzled.

I was expecting a relatively sweet, fruity opening: pear, raspberry, saffron... These notes were all familiar to me. Then I took the cap off the tester and I detected the raspberry. A very sour raspberry. Maybe the acidity is also enhanced by the patchouli? Well, in any case, I sprayed the fragrance and...

No sign of raspberry, pear, or saffron.
I rather perceived a peppery note.

In the drydown, it becomes softer and fruitier and slightly floral. The ""acidity"" remains, but diminishes.

The bottle of Intense Oud is very elegant and chic. Intense Oud by Gucci is comparatively linear, yet it does not lack a certain complexity. Fruity notes accompany very subtle oud. Noticeable without being obtrusive.

However, this fragrance definitely stands out. It is subtle but not overpowering, yet still easily perceptible. Spicy, slightly smoky, and with that fruity twist, this is true perfumer's art.

Gucci Intense Oud,06/11/2024,Paoloneroli2,M,4,,2,Beautiful Winter Fragrance,"Designer in a niche coat with bombastic longevity and truly decent sillage.

Gucci Intense Oud,01/16/2023,Anzibel,M,6,,1,Top Designer! '19,"Wood, oud, leather, and incense give it enough masculinity, while amber and olibanum add even more allure. A true masterpiece, lasting 12 hours. The projection is not huge, but it doesn't quite reach the skin. The ladies are thrilled. There are essentially no similarities with B.Afgano!"
Gucci Intense Oud,07/23/2023,Lauser93,M,1199,,3,A great wintery-Christmas scent,"Many thanks to Sören for the sample :-) With ""Gucci Intense Oud | Gucci,"" you are dealing with a truly wonderful, wintery, and Christmas fragrance. Strolling through the Christmas market in the evening, sipping a cup of mulled wine or punch, while the snow is falling... and then there's this perfume! Yes, it fits! The longevity is easily 8-10 hours, and after showering, the scent is still recognizable on the skin. The sillage is similarly impressive.

In the top notes, you can catch a whiff of raspberries and pears - but only for a few minutes. Additionally, saffron is clearly present here. The fragrance pyramid mentions floral aromas in the heart note - I can at least identify them in the form of rose water. Here, the scent DNA drifts into the Christmas season. I detect cinnamon, nutmeg, incense, clove, and myrrh. The base remains smoky with opoponax, but also has a beautifully dark, warm, and woody scent of oud. In the background, there are balsamic, earthy, woody, tobacco-like, vanillic, and animalic hints of amber, musk, and a bit of patchouli.

I understand that some people may want to draw a similarity to ""Black Afgano (Extrait de Parfum) | Nasomatto."" The smoky note may remind one of this Extrait de Parfum, but for me, the rest has its own unique character."

Gucci Intense Oud,03/14/2025,Aum108,M,4,,0,"Something about ""Intense""","I bought this perfume a few years ago because of the many good reviews.

Of all the heavy oriental scents, I like ""intense Oud"" the least. I have one of the old versions (Batch 5243) and this earlier batch is quite beastly and lasts forever.
However, it doesn't go down as well with others as Jubilation XXV or Carlisle. Instead of compliments, I have been asked by acquaintances not to wear this perfume anymore. And even in the elevator, I occasionally received a nose wrinkle from others. That's why I haven't worn it in a long time and will definitely sell it again.

Scent: Very dark and heavy, but it's just ""too intense"" for my taste.
And the oud note comes across as a bit too artificial for me. *self-nose-wrinkle*
I assume that there is no real oud in Gucci anyway.
But for those who like beastly-animalic scents, it should definitely be worth trying.

Occasion: I really wouldn't know for what occasion. Maybe if you want people to keep their distance on the train or subway ;-)

Season: Only winter, only outdoors. Definitely not an office scent; Versace Oud Noir would be more suitable for that."
Gucci Intense Oud,07/12/2025,JaskoM,M,13,,0,Beautiful Oud Scent,"I find this scent beautiful and my wife likes it on me as well. However, I don't think I would repurchase it, as it is just too ""bland"" compared to my many other fragrances. What I do appreciate is that the Oud used is not animalic at all. I believe everyone would like this scent, so it makes a great gift."
Guilty pour Homme,01/27/2014,Smartfred,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Very Surprised at the rating,"As one of the most popular colognes sold right now (currently #3 on Amazon) I was very surprised that this cologne only received average ratings.

The cologne is one of my personal favorites and works great in almost every situation as a neutral scent. You can wear it day or night and at work or out playing.

One of the best main stream colognes out there in my opinion but I just don't understand why it's ranked so low."
Guilty pour Homme,08/11/2012,Missk,F,1357,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Not happy with you Gucci,"Oh golly, too strong! Way, way too strong.

Can you believe there is now an intense flanker of Gucci Guilty for Men? Well I can't, and I sure hope I don't smell it on any man I date.

Gucci Guilty is a mish-mash of sharp citrusy lemon, powerful lavender, soapy orange blossom and earthy patchouli. The overall blend is quite, well what's the word, sour. The man in the poster may look like he's 'God's gift to women' with the lady below him looking as if she might be thrown into the thralls of passion at any given moment, but I highly doubt her reaction has anything to do with his perfume, if you know what I mean.

At times it feels as if Gucci was aiming for a citrus aquatic, something slightly sporty and fresh, but the peppery and earthy patchouli and woods kind of crushes that idea. God only knows where this perfume is supposed to be worn. Fingers crossed men don't wear this hoping to get lucky in the bedroom. I think you might get a negative response.

Unfortunately I don't find Gucci Guilty for Men all too sweet either. I think I may have liked a little sweetness to balance out the scent. All I can say for this fragrance is that the longevity and sillage are very good, near excellent if I actually liked this God damn fragrance!

The worst masculine from Gucci by far. I am saddened by this because I've been impressed by most of the male fragrances from this brand, namely Envy, Gucci pour Homme (original) and Gucci pour Homme II. In fact, skip this fragrance entirely. Buy the three I mentioned above. Yes, do that."
Guilty pour Homme,01/08/2012,Thatsmr2usir,M,67,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Gucci what art thou doing???,"LOL! Ok Gucci is my favorite designer house. However, they have been such a let down in the fragrance department as of late. This is so not Gucci. It is a mixture of 50 different scents combined, SYNTHETIC @ it's best! Smells like 1 of Joop's creations, reminds me of ahhhh Lanvin Homme YES!!!! BLAH! Last 6 hours or so on me & then it makes it's exit. The dry down is such a let down. I am really fed up with Gucci from a fragrance stand point!

This new crap they develop & put on the market today is very messy indeed. I have not liked anything this house has made after Envy for men. Everything else was a miss or did not last long enough for me to get a bottle. ( GUCCI POUR HOMME 2 )

Guilty should appeal to those who like GUCCI just because that's who made it & to those who may think the bottle is nice which it is, however do not expect to impress anyone with this. You will just be 1 of the many other people in the crowd not standing out, but following the circus."
Guilty pour Homme,06/09/2022,Herkules762,M,37,,3,Not as bad…,"…as ratings suggest.
I’ve seen this one on the shelf at my friend’s house, and remembered that Zara Silver is presumed to be the dupe of Gucci Guilty.
I have Zara Silver since many years ago, and despite of being a boring mainstream scent, I really liked it. To be honest, when they were released, every second boy had this type of scent, it was somehow like PR 1M and Zara Uomo.
I wondered if they were really similar or not, so we did some business.
Yeah, that’s true. And I like both of them!
As time passed, they became unpopular, and now I decided to give them a chance again.

This sweet/neroli combo reminds me of Joop! Homme, but Gucci is more fresh, I can imagine as Joop’s Summer version.

Clean, sweet, fresh, easy to wear, for any occasion. Just spray on and enjoy."
Guilty pour Homme,06/11/2021,Kurai,M,388,,2,Evening freshie,"There's nothing wrong with a perfume being mainstream. This one certainly fits that description. It's easy-going, friendly, versatile and yet not completely without a soul. Citrusy and floral, not so sweet. In the base there is patchouli, which makes it suitable for evening wear. Maybe not clubbing, as it's not heavy on ambrox or tonka.

Performance is just so-so. Two to three hours of decent projection after which it slowly starts to fade. The EDP flanker is similar and lasts longer."

The longevity was quite good, I could feel it on the clothes the next days..."
Guilty pour Homme,03/04/2013,Miaw2,M,339,,1,Not worked for me,"Smells much like Allure Homme Sport, so it's a big disappointment for me considering the masterpieces GPH I and GPH II.

Sillage, lasting power and projection are below average. Thumbs down.

Updated January 2014"
Guilty pour Homme,06/22/2025,braydenlaw,M,4,,1,"Smells Great, but disappointing performance","This is a scent that I wish had just more projection and longevity. It smells amazing, and the pink pepper does not perform like it usually does with a bubblegum scent for me. This is classy and sexy and would be amazing for any formal event/setting, or in an office since it does not project loudly.

I sprayed 6 times, 4 pulse points, 1 on the shirt, one behind the neck, and it just does not speak or last; even on clothing. It has nothing to do with being nose blind, as I have worn the Invictus parfum for hours and it lasted (and stayed pronounced) even after a run and a shower. I know this is an EDT, but I have other EDTs, like JPG Le Beau, that perform so much better. I need to try the parfum of this version to see if it is any better.

The notes start off with a sweet citrus that lingers throughout the evolution, then the scent opens into a hearty floral smell with the base of a light wood. The scent just smells extremely clean and has a spicy, soapy profile, as well. I absolutely love the way this one smells, but for the money and the performance I can't justify buying this again or recommending it."
Guilty pour Homme,03/06/2021,Henskis,M,7,,0,Just a bad purchase,"This one I had only once in my lifetime and I wouldn't like to get again. It doesn't smell synthetic, which is the best thing I can say about this perfume. The smell was just very basic and average, you can buy similar scent perfumes for fracture of this cost. It is extremely overpriced(maybe because they had to pay a lot for commercial and actors for promotion) and doesn't worth it. I got this perfume just because it was very hyped and everyone wanted to have them. Why? I'm still not sure. I really can't understand those reviews with 10/10 scent. So, you're literally saying that's the best smell you've ever had? I'm feeling sad for you then. Don't buy it, save your money."
Guilty pour Homme,06/27/2020,Parma,M,277,,22,Clean Gummy Candy - Shower Gel in Good,"I like it. Very pleasing. Sexy. Understated. Radiates cleanliness and a sweet fruity (masculine) spicy shower gel freshness. With a slightly metallic aura.

I can't pick out individual notes here. Everything flows together without contours and results in a ""cooked down"" mass. The orange blossom is the most recognizable - as I knew it - it is restrainedly sweet, with a slight oriental (spicy) effect in its fullness, and like the entire fragrance, it is pleasantly balanced. I always associate the distinct shower gel aspect in such scents with sweet-spicy lavender (from Spain? - I once heard that the further south, the sweeter). From my perspective, this is also responsible for the masculine orientation. Lactonic notes, which are not listed here, create the smooth food gummy impression that can be perceived as metallic and cool. Accompanied by a hinted vanilla feeling. The transparent violet of the liquid fits well with the character of the fragrance, as it has enough (attractive) substance/depth alongside the cool basic freshness.

Overall, I get the impression of a sweet-spicy gummy candy shower gel with a subtly oriental vibe and a clean, slightly metallic basic freshness. An underlying, hinted soapy quality provides a well-groomed and traditional touch. This elevates the fragrance for me - alongside its understatement - above the mass of similarly positioned shower gel scents and keeps it in an interesting tension between popular-modern pleasingness (which predominates) and classically oriented grooming (which rounds it off).

What I find particularly interesting is that it strongly focuses on this smooth gummy candy note. It is very stable and rounded, without scratchiness or fraying throughout. Quality or well-crafted synthetic. I like this thematic simplicity or reduction, and it is the strength of the fragrance for me. It does not pretend to be different and does not ""sneak"" any shower gel freshness into the composition out of calculation, which usually bothers me in function. Good longevity on my skin rounds off the positive overall impression. Sexy & chewy!"
Guilty pour Homme,05/21/2011,Monsieur,M,14,,14,The Lawn Mower Scent,"Gucci Guilty, the new heavily advertised mainstream fragrance, launched at a rather strange time: just after the Christmas shopping season; I would love to ask their marketing folks what they were expecting from that... ;-)
As part of the promotion, there was even a special stand at our Müller in the mini city with all the bells and whistles, and I was showered with samples everywhere over the last few months.

About the scent itself:
At first sniff, I quite liked it, and subconsciously, I was already expecting a rating of 70%. But then came the tests, which turned out to be very disappointing.
On the skin, I don't really like it anymore, and by now, I can't stand it on strips either.
What's the reason?! The top note (as far as I can perceive it; if you spray it on the side or have a bad day, these things are gone before you know it or smell) is quite pleasant, a bit of lavender in concentrations that I find acceptable.
And what comes after?
-> the chemical club, a synthetic something and a long-term horror - the notes can be thrown straight into the trash, as an indefinable strange thing comes along that haunts you for hours, hardly changes for me, and penetrates; I could never really smell the base notes (probably the soap was already at work beforehand), and this strange pseudo-heart note has burned itself into my memory, making one wonder what could possibly be understood under orange blossom. An attempt to describe the reality would be: cheap chewing gum with a failed peppermint substitute-something-else and fruit aroma E xyz...

This leaves the question ""How did it get the strange title,"" did the top note tip over in the heat, and is it mentally approaching the lawn mower man from the eponymous film, or what’s going on?! After all, you can't smell anything grassy there...
The answer is very banal: I transferred some sample packets into a travel sprayer, as they are just the good old tubes without anything, and since I want to fill something new in them again, Guilty is annoying me by now, I never want to wear it publicly again and have it around me all day, I decided today to wear it for mowing the lawn and use it up: every 1-3 weeks, I will properly douse myself before heading to grandpa's, where you are then busy for a good hour, sweating decently, chatting a bit with grandpa, and then leaving; sweated out, dry, dusty, and slightly tired, it will soon be time for a shower, where a thorough cleaning takes place...
(also, the clothes go straight to the laundry)
While mowing the lawn, Guilty doesn't annoy me, it's OK - today’s attempt proved this even in the heat (there's nothing left; due to sweating, it was also less intense at some point)

PS: I have nothing against my grandpa and don't want to torture him or use Guilty to make him ask me, the lazy boy, not to mow the lawn so often... ;-)"
Guilty pour Homme,12/01/2017,MmmTasty,M,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Guilty,"Haven't bought a fragrance in years. A lot has changed...
...now you can even rate fragrances on the internet.

I was relatively satisfied for some time with two Boss balls and the summer edition from Boss, until it became a bit monotonous towards the end. Additionally, a Gucci fragrance had accompanied me in my subconscious for 15 years. It gave me a warm feeling in combination with the memories associated with it from back then.

So I did some research (googled Gucci) and ordered Guilty.
First impression ''mhhh delicious, this is it...''

Almost like back in the day with that white square (name unknown...guilty), which, although not identical to the currently described Guilty, is similar. This Gucci Guilty is, in my opinion, heavier, meaning in the context of the notes, more woody-smoky.

The ''base line'' (I don't have the politically correct perfume terminology down...guilty) so the ''main scent'' (yes, it's getting worse...guilty) reminds me of an incredibly interesting time and is very close to the fragrance from back then.

The notes are not particularly complex, but they radiate an attractive warmth. No mega sillage (with 2-3 ''sprays'') for oneself, yet the fragrance is still pleasantly noticeable for a long time. For those closer to you, even longer. Rarrrrrrr
For a good duration of 8-9 hours.
So... why not guilty mmmhhh..."
Guilty pour Homme,01/26/2011,Turandot,F,839,,11,"I quite like it, whether the gentlemen will too remains to be seen","After the disappointment with the women's fragrance, I was rather skeptical when Guilty pour Homme was announced. And the expectation was indeed justified, as the scent smells exactly as indicated in the pyramid. Not more and not less, and no note stands out particularly. Thus, for me, it is a very pleasant daytime fragrance when I want a scent without a significant message.

But which gentlemen will see it that way? The Boss faction certainly won't, as it's not warm enough for them. The Le Male fans find it too conservative. The One Million guys think it's too boring, the Joop freaks find it not oriental enough, and the ""something fresh"" customers think it's not sporty enough.

However, I find it very harmonious, and I particularly like the dark, woody base. The fragrance has a fundamental mood that runs throughout its entire progression. It doesn't make leaps, has no surprises, and there's no vanilla or herbal notes sneaking in through the back door.

Now I'm curious to see how the black-silver bottle with the double G will be received by the gentlemen."
Guilty pour Homme,03/15/2024,Skalph,M,1,,11,Great Scent,"I recently got it and find it significantly more tolerable and less synthetic than Dior Sauvage EdT. I don't understand why some reviews are rather negative. The scent is citrusy and fresh, making it well-suited for spring.
I also find the fragrance quite masculine, and my girlfriend likes it a lot."
Guilty pour Homme,01/12/2017,Empereur,M,2,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,No Love at Second Sight!,"Fueled by a very pleasant memory of Gucci Guilty Intense, I wanted to try the corresponding counterpart for men as well. To get straight to the point, after an initial euphoria, the result unfortunately turned out to be rather sobering.

Scent:
The scent itself has a lemony, captivating, and velvety top note that clings to the body, slightly sweet, which for me neither smells synthetic nor comes across as too intrusive.
In contrast to the top note, the heart note, where I can only faintly perceive the orange blossom, already seems very restrained. It is a very delicate fragrance, but it is also overshadowed by hints of patchouli and cedarwood, making it difficult to distinguish between the heart and base notes. One could now comfortably describe the scent as a homogeneous blend of all components, which - as many before me have pointed out - leaves a distinctly synthetic impression.
After a few hours, only a certain oriental warmth from the patchouli and cedarwood can be perceived. The scent fades more or less into empty space...

Bottle:
With the Gucci emblem on the front of the bottle, Gucci Guilty pour Homme can easily be classified into the large Gucci family. What I also notice is that the bottles of the Gucci Guilty members are quite similar, with the women's being gold and this one silver. I would also criticize that the cap of the bottle unfortunately cannot be locked, which poses a risk when handling it and can easily slip out of your hand.

Sillage:
Even with the sillage, only the hint of a scent trail can be perceived at the beginning, so that inclined male and female connoisseurs quickly lose interest when trying to turn around on the street.

Conclusion:
Unfortunately, with Gucci Guilty pour Homme, especially in contrast to Gucci Guilty Intense, the initial interest quickly wanes, resulting in only a brief scent liaison. Guilty pour Homme thus joins the ranks of mainstream fragrances and leaves no truly lasting impression."
Guilty pour Homme,12/20/2022,Mikka01,M,39,,7,"Citrusy, fruity, masculine!","Here is my latest acquisition. No, not purchased, but received as a Christmas gift from my employer. And I must say, it's a home run.
I had to try it right away, so I sprayed some on my wrist.
The first impression: amazing! A pleasantly citrusy note that thrilled me, but slightly softened by the pepper. After that, it remains fruity, then takes a pleasant turn as the lavender comes to the forefront. This scent is rounded off by an increasingly woody and spicy note, leaving an incredibly masculine impression.
For me, this fragrance is a real surprise; I like it. Longevity and sillage are okay. I would say the bottle is not one that stands out as a highlight.
In any case, it’s one of my new favorite fragrances!"
Guilty pour Homme,02/14/2014,FabianO,M,1008,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Lifeless mixed fresh scent at supermarket shelf level,"I can only say: ""Gucci pour homme"". ""Gucci pour homme II"". ""Gucci Envy"".

THAT was Gucci's heyday in the fragrance world.
Since then?

As far as the nose can reach: insignificant, interchangeable, watery-fresh stuff, for which one shouldn't spend more than 10 euros for 50 ml.

I don't have much to say about ""Guilty"": fresh 08/15 start, a bit of lemon, homeopathic lavender.

A hint of orange, surrounded by shallow wood, with a trace of soap on top. Doesn't hurt anyone. But nobody needs it!

This could also be produced by ""8x4"" or ""Axe"". But at least they are fair with their prices."
Guilty pour Homme,02/26/2023,Lauser93,M,1199,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Better than expected,"Before I go into detail about this fragrance, I must say that I am positively surprised, as the reviews are rather negative and I would consider this men's fragrance to be a unisex perfume.

The top note has a lovely lemon aroma with a pleasant spiciness. The heart note is beautifully floral with a hint of orange blossom. The base offers a combination of a green-earthy patchouli note, but the base also slightly reminds me of that Solero ice cream aroma consisting of orange and vanilla.

The longevity on clothing is quite solid, and on the skin, it can be detected for up to 8 hours. The sillage, on the other hand, could be improved."
Guilty pour Homme,05/19/2015,pudelbonzo,F,2405,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,right scent - wrong name,"When I bought Guilty Intense for myself yesterday, the attentive saleswoman also offered me Guilty pour Homme.
My husband shouldn't go home empty-handed.

I had previously avoided the Guiltys - after all, who wants to smell ""guilty""?

But Intense taught me otherwise, and so I let Pour Homme pass through my nose as well.

Here too, I am greeted warmly by lavender and lemon - a slightly nostalgic blend that immediately puts me in a positive mood.
The orange blossom warms the scent into something cozy.
Patchouli gives Guilty depth, and the cedarwood adds a hint of smokiness.
Nevertheless, the scent remains well-balanced - without being lukewarm.
It makes a likable statement that is far removed from ""guilty"".

I can easily imagine this scent on my friend, who prefers to wear men's fragrances."
Guilty pour Homme,05/29/2016,DonJuanDeCat,M,2046,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Guilty of being an inconsequential fragrance,"I find it very sad how poorly and also inconsequentially almost all Gucci fragrances smell.
I unfortunately do not know Gucci pour Homme I, but it is said to have been an excellent fragrance. However, I do know Gucci pour Homme II, which is one of my favorite fragrances because it smells absolutely wonderful, although unfortunately with a slightly stronger pepper note.

Therefore, since I got to know pour Homme II, I have always been curious about how other fragrances from Gucci would smell. And each time I was disappointed, so that I no longer paid attention to most of them. Then I thought that maybe I was just blinded by Pour Homme II and decided to test again.

But no, … it actually seems that Gucci has hardly any good fragrances besides the Pour Hommes,… which makes the disappointment even greater.

The fragrance:
The fragrance starts briefly fresh with a lemon. Then you can smell a bit of lavender.
Especially in the sweet notes, you can recognize the almost dripping synthetic quality.
So, synthetic doesn’t always have to be bad, but here the fragrance almost comes off as a cheap scent that was carelessly created for the mass market.
A little later, light orange blossoms are added, but it remains sweetish.
In the end, the typical woody notes (cedar) form the base and make the fragrance a bit warmer, and that’s about it.

The sillage and longevity:
The sillage is at best above average. The citrus notes are not zesty enough to project well, the fragrance leaves no scent trail and is therefore only slightly perceived nearby.
The longevity is also low, lasting just about four to five hours.

The bottle:
The bottle is quite okay. The lower part is dark gray and not transparent. The upper area is glass and thus visible. The name of the fragrance is on the front, and a metallic Gucci logo has been attached, which upon closer inspection resembles a Batman logo, which I quite like!

I call this a disappointment across the board. Poorly made synthetic sweetness, carelessly mixed and apparently marketed for people who are only after brands and reach for the fragrance based on the actually strong Gucci brand. At least one could think so…

In any case, this fragrance does not have the class and quality of a Pour Homme II (or probably even I). Unfortunately, it is also not good in any other way, but smells at most ""nice without anything but nothing more"" and is absolutely inconsequential and replaceable by any random fragrance.

On top of that, there are the weak sillage and longevity and … well, I think nothing more needs to be said.

One can do nothing but sit down and wonder how Gucci could even release something as great as the two Pour Hommes (and perhaps a few other) fragrances. I also wonder if the ladies suffer similarly from inconsequential Gucci fragrances,… well, I will find that out eventually.

In any case, I can only hope that someday a Pour Homme III will appear that can reconnect with the wonderful older fragrances. Hopefully, this wish is not very unlikely…"
Guilty pour Homme,02/09/2011,Positron,M,72,,8,Sour for Bad Boys.,"A Gucci like a runaway ""Boss"", lemon at the top, biochemical formulas at the heart. Sweetly glued pressboard only if you're willing to wait for it. The orange blossom? A chimera!
On the bottle: The Batman emblem in a dive-arrow position. A bolt gun that’s better left alone. Silver flask for bread-and-butter men.
Then let’s rather write in the name that it’s for sinful boys and offer it to them in roulette with 50 derivatives as soon as there’s a need for ""something fresh"". Making room for up-and-comers who have run out of Axe.
Ah, what am I rambling about here around my verdict. There are more modest tastes than mine. And if I should really meet someone who wears ""Guilty"" with dignity, I will praise him - because he perfectly underscores his healthy average with this."
Guilty pour Homme,03/04/2011,Taurus,M,1164,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,The Boredom Exposed,"When I first saw Guilty by Gucci, I thought: “Hmm … at least a stylish bottle”

But at the same time, I wondered: “Will they manage to create a somewhat decent fragrance this time?”

In my opinion, Gucci hasn't really produced anything useful since Nobile. Perhaps ""Rush,"" which I always associated with the Canadian rock trio of the same name, was relatively acceptable.

So I set my expectations relatively low from the start, so I wouldn't be too disappointed.

And lo and behold - Guilty is just as unexciting as many of its olfactory peers.

Initially, there was a glimmer of hope because the slightly fruity floral lemon lavender top note pleasantly surprised me. But then it quickly became rather agreeable. With patchouli and cedarwood, much better things could be done.

Guilty is a fragrance that perhaps wants to seem seductive, but ultimately exudes the charm of gray bread. Personally, it's too mass-compatible for me, too safe, and thus too ordinary and too boring.

From a marketing perspective, the name is quite cleverly chosen. But what good is that if the content doesn't hold up?"
Guilty pour Homme,02/28/2016,GreenC,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Cuddly Scent,"As a newbie in the world of fragrances, I am (still) quite fond of mainstream scents. Just like with this fragrance. Recently, when I made a purchase at Douglas, I received this scent as a sample. Immediately, I checked on Parfumo how this fragrance was rated... Very poorly. Okay, I had no high expectations and applied it in the evening before going to sleep. Just two or three sprays and I noticed that this scent is very weak, so I added three more sprays, following the motto: more is more. Now the scent slowly started to reach me. Orange blossom and lemon came to mind first. Perhaps a bit synthetic, but well done. Alright, off to bed. The scent quickly transferred to the pillow and has something calming and clean about it. It made me forget the stress of everyday life and (took) me to a cloud bed and a beautiful dream world. The next evening, my pillow still held the Guilty scent. Nice for cuddly falling asleep. Some might think: I told you so, the scent is so boring, you can only fall asleep with it. But that’s not what I meant; rather, it’s nice as a sleep scent or for cuddling with a loved one, but I don’t think I will ever buy this fragrance, as it’s just too weak for me. You can only smell it when cuddling closely. To leave a scent trail behind, you would have to bathe in it. It’s a shame that it’s so weak.
I can’t understand the name Guilty, as I would have imagined a darker, evil, 'dirty' scent rather than such a soft, bright, fresh, clean, and rather innocent fragrance. To me, it also comes across as a bit powdery.
As I said, I haven’t come across better fragrances in this direction yet; there may certainly be better ones, but at the moment I really like this scent. It may be that in two years I will think differently about this fragrance, but my current feeling cannot be taken away from me."
Guilty pour Homme,02/15/2013,BackToBlack,M,112,,8,Gucci Guilty? Pack your bags and get out of here!,"No, no, and no again!
This perfume has nothing to do with Gucci! Absolutely nothing. Not even in the slightest. What a shame, really. - Because what is the advertising doing here?
It presents a man, the seducer of all female creatures, who can engage with almost any woman, even if she makes it difficult for him.

The advertising is nothing new. Like with many men’s perfumes. But here, the reality, I believe, has gone “drinking”..

When sprayed, it reminds me of absolutely nothing. Cedarwood, lemon, etc. where are you? It not only smells boring, it is boring. A hint of orange does eventually come through, but what am I supposed to do with a dull orange? I was visibly relieved when I no longer smelled it. The shower didn’t save it anyway.

The bottle is well made, but the scent is intended but not executed well.
What a shame - Gucci is a very prominent name in the world of perfumes. One application was enough, and that was only because I got it at a bargain price."
Guilty pour Homme,02/20/2022,Philipp91,M,219,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,3,"Light, Fresh Bubblegum Scent","Gucci Guilty EdT is a fruity, light fragrance without much complexity. Lemon, orange, and neroli, along with a bit of lavender (fresh, not musty heavy), pepper, and woods. That's it. I like such uncomplicated scents because they are versatile. Therefore, I appreciate them.

The downside is always the performance. The longevity is not really good, about 4 hours. The sillage is also hardly worth mentioning, Guilty is a skin-close scent. Unless you overspray. Even then, you probably won't offend anyone. The bottle is simple and beautiful, and the price is okay if you catch it on sale (I got it for around 40€/50ml). Give it a try, even for a blind buy!"
Guilty pour Homme,06/30/2013,FLUidENTITY,M,246,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Beauty Flaw? Definitely!,"Gucci Guilty is almost the quintessential mainstream commercial product, almost too cliché and almost too easy to see through. The advertising campaign has been taken to the extreme.

First of all, the name Gucci Guilty is very well chosen. An alliteration with the two G's on the heavy beats of the speech rhythm. The two G's can also be found in the logo on the bottle, in the two intertwined G's. Both words are silvery and end with an i-sound. That's something to achieve.

The ad clips were conceived with Frank Miller. It is his comics that were adapted into film under the name Sin City by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. The city of Sin City is almost depicted in a cliché manner. Criminal priests, a clergy that controls the street prostitution, sadistic, pedophilic senator's sons, and under recitations of psalms, the death penalty is carried out. Betrayal, greed, drama. Inspired by this spirit, a fragrance collection for women and men is created under the direction of Frida Giannini. The ad clips show the anonymous urban jungle. Opacity and anonymity hang in the air. Almost a numinous atmosphere. To the sounds of Depeche Mode's song ""Strangelove,"" it shows a city loner, who knows no emotional attachment, meeting a woman with whom he spends the evening and then continues on his lonely path. Yet as a symbolic gesture, he takes her bracelet (from the house of Gucci) with him. Heroic, masculine, and daring, isn't it?

This is the stuff that Gucci Guilty is supposed to be made of. Hm, how does one achieve that olfactorily? What is suitable here?

The fragrance pyramid here at parfumo looks a bit different than the one on the Gucci homepage.
There it says: Lemon, mandarin, green leaves (crushed green leaves in English), pink pepper, lavender, coriander, orange blossom, neroli, patchouli, cedarwood, sandalwood, amber.

I can't really smell the mandarin, but the pepper blends well with the orange blossom, patchouli, and amber. Since the scent does not change subtly and everything is quickly in place, I now smell: lemon, pepper, orange blossom, patchouli, cedarwood, and amber. All together makes quite an impression. Disorderly, chaotic, and bold comes out as the effect. The orange blossom is said to have an aphrodisiac effect, or so the rumor goes. Patchouli has the potential to be dirty. Unfortunately, the highest quality raw materials were not used, and thus the execution is not entirely successful. But the scent can do a bit, I won't write it off.
The imperfect is written on its forehead. Beauty flaw? Definitely! The spoiled? Perhaps it is meant to be suggested. Does it concern the wearer? No! Is the scent unrefined? I would say so. A trustworthy, serious scent? Rather secondary. Can it afford to be? It doesn't care. Does it bring him joy? Irrelevant.
If the advertising machinery is so enormously elaborate, one might automatically think of a bad scent that is being pushed to the customer through the advertising. The advertising is so powerful that I believe one quickly suspects compensation for a lousy scent. Yet I enjoy the scent because it is uncomplicated. It smells completely natural. It is not a demanding and meticulous construction, but therein lies the charm, I think.

There are so many things that the scent simply does not care about."
Guilty pour Homme,08/08/2012,Lipkat,M,29,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Heart of glass,"I throw myself, it seems, more often into the fray for much-maligned fragrances. It can't be due to a protective instinct or a tendency towards principled fundamental opposition. Do I perhaps just have bad taste in scents? Or am I a bore? The latter was at least what this psych test in Neon claimed. It reached this conclusion partly because I find Jennifer Aniston more interesting than Angelina Jolie. So please! What kind of question is that???

Back to business. Guilty also disappointed me on the first test - as so often, I only came to appreciate it after several tries. On my skin, it primarily smells of cardamom, and it is quite aquatic with a hint of an indeterminate sour citrus fruit. The image I associate with this scent is glass; rough, small shards of glass in gray and violet. What this image has to do with the scent itself, I can't even say; I just keep seeing it in my mind's eye when I smell Guilty. And it is not negatively charged for me.

Certainly, it is not my favorite fragrance, but I do enjoy using it from time to time - and I find it quite sexy and daring, definitely not boring. The longevity is good, however, the scent shifts on my clothes after about 18 hours into a cliché note of oriental massage oil. That’s not so uplifting anymore, so I have to air out the clothes properly or toss them in the wash. If nothing else, that’s what the stuff is guilty of: I can forgive that."
Guilty pour Homme,10/29/2013,ZrankFappa,M,30,,4,Synthetic Power Shower Gel / will please everyone. But I am not everyone.,"Nice that I just had a second and final test run, which looked like this: In the back of my mind was the information that I had recently tested another Gucci Silverback.

I unscrewed the cap from the sample stick, moved my nose towards the fragrance dispenser - a tiny moisture rim even dripped onto my finger.
Here we go again! That unmistakable mainstream feeling is coming back! Yuck!

A bit of everything: lemon and orange for the bright sharp fruity, patchouli and cedarwood for the dark woody, some fluffiness thrown in, a whole lot of synthetic power shower gel for the average Joe.

Everything in equal parts, nothing can be recognized, it’s just a melange, a fresh-sporty-sticky mush,
It stings, bites, burns, done!
This is just as bland as any deodorant with the label ""Sport"".

You can't go wrong here!!!!!!!!!! let the marketing department cheer.
Yes, and nothing right either.
The sheer boredom and forced lack of statement annoys me.
All the more so because it’s probably quite long-lasting, it could even be durable.
To save my skin, I washed it off.

Is this a GUCCI?
But not the same. As described below, the marketing strategists of the Kering Group are desecrating its legacy. {Sure, I know Gucci Pour Homme I, and I haven't had the chance to extensively test GPH II yet.}
---
After reviewing my list, I raised it from 10% to 40%.
It’s not as bad as the truly tasteless Made to Measure from Gucci, for which I gave 20%.

At least Gucci Guilty doesn’t make me feel sick and it doesn’t offend the taste buds like, for example, L'Homme Parfum Intense by Yves Saint Laurent (2013) with 10%. These 10% are after accounting for all efforts, such as the dramatic shift in character within the first few minutes.

It’s simply unoriginal, interchangeable, arbitrary. In vocational school, you need 60% to pass with a 4. So 40% is a really fair failing grade for me."
Guilty pour Homme,09/24/2012,Leimbacher,M,2870,,5,"Fruity-meaty, unspectacular patchouli-melon that is unworthy of the name Gucci!","One of the biggest disappointments of recent years and not at all worthy of the great, traditional brand Gucci... only the stylish bottle is still okay, the rest is pretty much trash, not disgustingly bad, but even far from mediocrity.

The few ingredients already suggest above, oh isn't that a bit too little and uninspired... and that's exactly how it is. Sometimes less is more and the simplest things are the tastiest, but that's not the case here. It's so damn boring, outrageously arbitrary, and has been done better a thousand times before. I won't write a long comment either, this shower gel scent that calls itself perfume isn't worth it. Sillage and longevity are just about okay. The scent of fresh lemoniness and patchouli and wood is not an absolute stinker but rather reminds one of a €5 discount fragrance or a €2 shower gel.

Gucci Guilty PH Intense will be tested soon and is said to be significantly better, but that's not really hard to achieve!"
Guilty pour Homme,03/27/2014,Shamrock,M,39,,4,Guilty in the Sense of Good Taste,"Gucci Guilty is such a ""fragrance"" that you can't escape. Now, we don't have many perfumeries here, so the scents are offered in stores like Debenhams, Brown Thomas, or Boots, and that very excessively.
I don't know what got into Gucci to launch such a fragrance, because you usually associate the name Gucci with a certain style and not an Ed Hardy knockoff.

In Ireland, this ""fragrance"" was launched with great advertising effort and is supposedly one of the most popular scents in the 20-30 age group.
I believe that without reservation.

Guilty is an attempt to rescue the powerhouse fragrances of the seventies and eighties into the new millennium, and this attempt has pretty much failed miserably. Guilty smells like a Saturday night in Cork when college graduates rent a stretch limo and exuberantly roam through the clubs.
It's like a mix of Lynx ""Dark Temptation"" and testosterone.

You hardly perceive any ingredients, just a sweet mix of floral scents. It could just as well say in the fragrance notes ""old socks"" and ""four-week-old underwear,"" and you wouldn't recognize it.
No, dear people at Gucci, that was probably a grab in the trash, or a desperate attempt to regain a foothold in the fragrance market. However, this attempt has thoroughly failed and at best lures Irish youths with too much testosterone into the stores, so they can indulge extensively at the tester before heading off to their date. The Irish girls are mercilessly knocked out by such a cloud of fragrance.
Really a shame."
Guilty pour Homme,03/06/2021,Micmay56,M,3,,6,Under the Radar,"When you see the bottle, you get exactly that: A fresh, clean, elegant, and slightly metallic scent! Lightness and freshness dominate the fragrance, and you immediately think of elegance and luxury, but at the same time, the perfume also smells masculine and smooth due to the metallic undertone!
The scent doesn't seem to be very popular or widespread, which I honestly don't understand, especially since the longevity is perfectly fine!
A good alternative and comparable to Prada L'Homme, which is also a soapy, fresh, and elegant perfume - for me, it's clearly suitable for the office, a fancy dinner, or an evening gala, but also not out of place in everyday life!
For me, an underrated fragrance that you can't go wrong with."
Guilty pour Homme,03/08/2025,Haina,M,33,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Great Office Scent!,"Guilty pour Homme EAU DE TOILETTE is a fresh-fruity fragrance for men. In certain aspects, it also seems a bit unisex to me. After the first spray, you get a fruity, mild scent. Over time, this sweetness develops into a woody, slightly spicy direction. Additionally, there is a lasting freshness.

For me, this is a great everyday and office scent that is subtle and not overpowering. It is particularly pleasant to wear on warm spring days. A good, affordable recommendation for me."
Guilty pour Homme,04/19/2025,ComputerMaus,M,264,,6,The Scent of (Un)Guilt,"So this is how it should smell to be guilty. Fresh, fruity, floral, slightly citrusy, slightly sweet, slightly synthetic, minimally woody in the later stages. Light, harmless, friendly, but not endearingly charming. Okay. Guilty pour Homme EAU DE TOILETTE is not a fragrance that completely convinces me. It's the kind of scent you can always wear and that doesn't..."
Guilty pour Homme,01/19/2016,CST,M,17,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Sweet Lemon,"GG is relatively uncomplicated, citrusy without being sharp, lavender balances the top note quite well, which, however, only lasts relatively short (20 min max). After that, I don't perceive any orange blossom at all, unfortunately. It may also be because it is so artificial that one cannot even recognize it.

For me, it is not well done, similar to JPG Fleur du Male - I think orange only works when it is used in a high-quality way and processed gently (I always say, Grand Bal from Dior Privee :D )

Also well done in Coco by Chanel.

Here, unfortunately, very synthetic, the head and base notes blur together and the development is very marginal. The cedarwood with lingering lemon hits me hard after 30 minutes and I wish something would happen, but nothing happens anymore...for the next 5 hours...then it fades away.

Unfortunately too boring for me, without a highlight - not bad and not offensive, but also not positively outstanding. Sweet lemon in an average scent, which is available at a low price and will certainly be a good alternative for some."
Guilty pour Homme,04/25/2022,Duftor,M,26,,0,pleasant but...,"The scent starts off really interesting and is very similar to other Guilty perfumes, including the Love Edition. After much consideration, I ultimately decided not to purchase this fragrance.

I noticed that while this scent develops nicely, it becomes almost undetectable after a few hours. As soon as you spray another perfume, you can hardly smell Guilty at all. That was the point where I found it disappointing. I particularly enjoy the light citrus and heavy notes in this fragrance; it develops quite charmingly. Therefore, I recommend switching to the perfume from Gucci to fully appreciate the experience. It shouldn't come across negatively regarding the scent, as it is truly good."
Guilty pour Homme,02/09/2011,Sammy,M,90,,4,Acquittal due to lack of evidence,"Well, Gucci hasn't released a decent men's fragrance in a while. So for me, Guilty is already a positive signal. Okay, nothing spectacular happens, but the patchouli-cedarwood base is not to be underestimated. Together with a strong orange blossom and a splash of lemon, Guilty is certainly not to blame for smelling bad. Even the quality is somewhat acceptable; sure, there are better ones, but this perfume leaves quite a decent impression.

Sammy :-)"
Guilty pour Homme,08/31/2021,ObviousNinja,M,2,,4,"My ""First"" Perfume","As the title of this review suggests, I cannot remember my first perfume. I’m probably not the first one to think about this and be unable to recall.

The ""Guilty pour Homme"" by Gucci could possibly ignite my passion for perfumes, something even the saleswoman at the duty-free shop in Cyprus could not have guessed.

But let’s start from the beginning:

It’s summer - I am in my training - the first big vacation is coming up.

After extensive research, I decided on Cyprus as my vacation destination.
However, let’s jump straight to the duty-free shop in Cyprus.

We were greeted warmly, and without much thought, I was determined to buy something there for my mother.

How I ended up at the Gucci testers for my mother after a successful search, I unfortunately no longer remember. There it was - the first contact with Guilty pour Homme by Gucci.
It was indeed ""love at first sniff,"" as they often say.

Now it came to the decision: ""EdT"" or ""EdP""?
As an ""inexperienced lad,"" I didn’t know these terms - I was aware that there are different strengths/durations, but I had never used the technical terms/designations.
It should be noted that Gucci only mentions this on the packaging and possibly hides it at the bottom of the bottle.

After a brief moment of consideration and the presence of the saleswoman, I chose the ""EdT"" version. The stronger ""EdP"" simply put me off during testing due to its ""sharpness.""

Almost 80 € less in my wallet and a newfound passion.

In hindsight, I probably wouldn’t buy the perfume anymore, as I have become accustomed to different sillage/duration and my horizons have significantly broadened."
Guilty pour Homme,01/31/2011,LouiePacard,M,40,,3,Fresh Shower - nothing more!,"I was testing all the new arrivals today.

I've been sniffing the patch of skin that was sprayed with Gucci Guilty pour Homme the whole time.

It's really not a bad scent - it reminds me immensely of Kenzo eau bla bla bla (not the original Kenzo). Like a fresh shower, nothing more. Unfortunately, nothing special. What a pity!"
Guilty pour Homme,10/24/2011,Alucard,M,17,,2,guilty,"I actually like the opening of lavender and lemon, but I doubt whether these essences have ever inhaled sunlight.

After a few minutes, a scent note joins in that personally makes me suspect bitter or blood orange; even at this stage of the fragrance development, the lavender saturates the citrus, and it may be that the first hints of patchouli are already present.

I don't find the scent woody; rather, it is soft and cozy. No trace of Sin-City rawness, as the ad tries in vain to suggest.

Conclusion: More suitable for students and pupils than for Russian oligarchs."
Guilty pour Homme,11/26/2015,Design,M,3,,0,The One Splash ...,"After a long absence, I'm speaking up again :)

Since I don't own many simple citrus-fresh fragrances, I find it hard to categorize this scent.

It starts off very fresh and sharp, which is probably due to the lavender, but this freshness fades away quickly, and I only smell a salty-fruity orange base note, which reminds me of a toned-down top note of the lesser-known Joop Splash, which also came out in 2011.

The heart note that remains for me reminds me of the unfortunately too weak The ONE, just without the smoky sweetness that is sooooo great about The ONE.

The scent is perceived more closely to the body. I would argue that many women will like this fragrance, as it doesn't steal the show from them with its subtlety :)

Basically, this is an acceptable but overpriced mainstream scent that I don't want to speak badly of.

For anyone considering buying this fragrance, I recommend just giving Joop Splash a sniff, as it is significantly cheaper, or you can snag a bottle of Guilty 50 ml for 10 euros :)"
Guilty pour Homme,01/25/2022,Luca1505,M,2,,1,"Solid, but by no means exceptionally special","This perfume was the first one I owned at a significant age. Back then, as a novice, it completely blew me away; today, I must unfortunately say that it only moderately impresses me. Nevertheless, it receives too much unjustified criticism; while it is neither unique nor polarizing, it is very versatile in its application. The timeless, unobtrusive freshness makes this scent a solid all-rounder, good for school or the office, where most likely the majority wear it. This citrusy freshness fades after a while, at which point the peppery aromas dominate.
As a brief comparison to another ""office scent"": GG pour homme can certainly hold its own against Prada l'homme; it is fresher and a tad spicier, but not as refined/elegant and powdery, which is due to the absence of iris in GG, which is included in Prada l'homme. Formally speaking, it is a worthy competitor, but it ultimately comes down to personal taste in which direction one wants to go,
In terms of performance and longevity, not much stands out: it's okay, but by no means outstanding. On me, it lasts around &h, after which it really only becomes a body scent. I think that’s acceptable for an EdT, especially a fresh one.

PS: You really have to smell it; it’s not that easy to describe. Many see it as a shower gel scent, but I must say that it doesn’t smell too ""shower gel-like"" to me, even though it is quite fresh."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,06/23/2024,Smirky,M,483,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Testosteronic Man Juice,"AWESOME, testosteronic man juice, very dry, without a hint of sweetness. This scent is to the grape juice/bubble gum boys what garlic is to a vampire. hahaha Main scents I get here after dry down are leather, let me repeat, LEATHER, mineral spirits and subtle smokiness and earthiness. No gasoline or petrol scent (as in Fahrenheit) but mineral spirits. If you've ever cleaned paint brushes in mineral spirits, you'll know what I mean. Overall, this scent reminds me very closely of the scent of oil based Color Putty®, for those of you who have done finish carpentry with stained hardwood trim.

For such a hyper masculine fragrance, muscular performance is expected and Guilty Absolute does not disappoint. Excellent longevity, projection and sillage. Up the sprays and they'll know you walked in the room or maybe you'll knock 'em dead. hahaha And no surprise - another awesome creation by Mr. Morillas. Dude is a genius. Guilty Absolute is in my top 5."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,01/02/2018,sebjar,M,55,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Homme Review,This is my Gucci Guilty Absolute Review video. Picked up a bottle of Gucci Guilty on the day our San Francisco Gucci boutique started selling it and have been wearing it and enjoying the scent very much. I must say Gucci Guilty Absolute is not an original scent because I’ve actually smelled Gucci Guilty Absolute somewhere in the past. Possibly from a niche perfume release somewhere I'm thinking. I most likely saw Vetiver in the notes and gave it a chance. So I love Vetiver in fragrances but I can’t remember what that fragrance was. Bummer. But for a designer release Gucci Guilty Absolute is a very unique scent and I’m happy Gucci is making a comeback and releasing more bolder fragrances. As mentioned in the video this is my first Gucci fragrance in ages. The last fragrance I bought from Gucci was Gucci Pour Homme 2 GPH2 but I bought GPH2 much after when it was launched and the hype had died down as it is a pretty great release. But the last real Gucci release I bought was Gucci Rush back in 2001/2002 and Guccy Envy back in 1999 and 2000. Everything after that I dismissed until now with Gucci Guilty Absolute. Watch my video to find out more about Gucci Guilty Absolute. Thank you.
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,12/10/2021,Elysium,M,898,,11,Sometimes The Art Is In The Subtlety,"I am in the middle of an ancient village, one where you can breathe medieval air. I go down the stairs that lead me into the basement. There is a half-open door. I enter, and I am immediately surrounded by an aseptic air, which smells preservative. I see on the walls a series of shelves filled with dark brown glass bottles, similar to those once used for storing pharmaceutical iodine liquids. Perhaps one of them has recently shattered. The smell of the pharmaceutical-like odour is pungent. A vast, old, damp wooden table is in the centre of the room. On its surface lie stacked several splits of all sorts of animal skins. Raw leather, wet-white or wet-blue, from calf, buffalo and cow. Maybe this place was an old tannery. The atmosphere is dense and crowded but not stuffy or annoying. Indeed, the mixture of medicinal, wood, and leather smells creates a perfume that is anything but obnoxious. These are the sensations that the images take shape in my mind when I smell Guilty Absolute.

I recently came across the Guilty Absolute pour Femme perfume, which pleasantly blew me away. Despite being intended for a female audience, a male audience that does not cease at the initial fruity and floral accords can also wear very well the perfume. And I am talking about berries and dark blooms, and the rose is just a hint. It's not as tough as Guilty Absolute pour Homme, but it manifests those cough syrup undertones that remind me of my beloved Joop! Homme EAU DE TOILETTE, to give you an idea. But, apart from this excursus, my intention here is to tell you something about Absolute, a masterpiece that immediately kidnapped my soul and that was kindly given to me as a birthday present a few years ago. So, Absolute is so dreadful, an explosive bomb full of woody, leathery, animalic, earthy and smoky accords. This scent is dry, with no sweetness. It has the same intensity and opulence as oud-based perfumes, while not containing any trace of oud: could it be the custom-made Woodleather ™, a molecule isolated from the rare and precious Oud oil?
Regarding the scent, Absolute is purposely linear, and its structure doesn't change much with development and tends to stay the same all the time. It's far from common designer trends, and if you smell it knowing nothing, you might think of something niche. It doesn't contain many ingredients but only focuses on the toughest, woody and earthy tones. So, it wouldn't surprise me to read that it's anything but a crowd-pleaser.

Absolute announces itself with a peaty and incisive bouquet, almost phenolic, and at the same time, I perceive its sensuality. It reminds me a lot of those places where the atmosphere is full of medicinal smells, but also that smoky cloud that surrounds you when you smell an excellent peaty whiskey, my favourite kind of scotch whiskey. At first, it can be scary, especially imagining it by reading my impressions. Still, I assure you that it works, and it is this almost aseptic smokiness gives Absolute this semblance of a niche. So, it may sound a little creepy, but it doesn't bother me at all. I guess the smoky, resinous aroma is due to cypress, here in a species called Nootka Tree, which features grapefruit undertones and sour currant smells, woody and resinous, of course, with leathery and amber-rich accents. And the leathery look is already there, lingering in the background.

The initial burst calms down quickly, and a more woody accord continues through the scent development and hints of leather and incense are combined. The leather is quite dark and soft, relatively restrained, and is much less direct and robust than other famous leathery-centred colonies. At this stage, the perfume is very magnetic for me. I find myself sniffing my wrist, or the cork of the bottle if I have it close at hand, repeatedly during this phase.

At the bottom, a characteristic shade of vetiver takes shape, which is salty, smoky and dark that hatches, intensifying the chemical and phenolic atmosphere and increasing the leathery one and projecting an element of warm vegetation, giving relief from the harshness. As Absolute dries, it clears without betraying the overall aroma, becoming more and more transparent until only a shade of peat smoke remains, that smoky veil that eventually remains in the now empty whiskey glass. I get some weaker patchouli in the bottom, but it's not prominent. It gives it a slight earthiness, but it's not spicy, chocolaty or minty, just a little dirty.

Ultimately, regardless of its linear peculiarity, for me, it is a spicy and smooth alcoholic skin that glides into dark smoky vetiver and rests on a dry base of patchouli and wood. Dark, warm, comforting and mysterious. I can't think of any mainstream designer perfume that smells like this. It's not too strong. It sits close to the skin but strong enough to stay with me most of the day. I would recommend wearing it in autumn and winter, discreet enough and suitable for the office. It has a medium yield on my skin, not bestial, lasts a long time but casts weakly.

I base the review on a 50ml bottle I have owned since June 2017.

Guilty Absolute pour Homme,10/25/2022,ScentGrail,M,108,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,An Affordable Leather Masterpiece,"Gucci Guilty Absolute is a dark, mysterious, and bold fragrance that would be more suited as a niche fragrance rather than a designer release which ultimately ended in discontinuation.

Even if I have more affinity for leather fragrances such as Dior’s Fahrenheit, Tom Ford’s Ombre Leather, and Marc-Antoine Barrois Ganymede, I cannot ignore the fact how original this is, and how it actually smells fantastic.

By wearing it repeatedly more and more, you will realize how strangely addictive it really is, and how much first impression can fool us. A fragrance masterpiece of our time. Get it while you still can.

TOP NOTES
The mixture of old leather jacket aroma, and aromatic natural smelling green cypress is what opens and rushes into your olfactive senses.

The antiseptic, and band-aid-like scent profile is here as well but is better experienced when smelled rather than reading or hearing about it.

This is undoubtedly one of the best leather-based fragrances I have experienced in my life, and this is coming for someone who has tried almost all popular and less popular leather fragrances on the market.

HEART NOTES
As the fragrance slowly transitions into the heart notes, the fragrance starts to get more natural, with touches of sweet accords reminding more of pine and cypress tree sap.

A detectable woodiness from vetiver, patchouli, and goldenwood also keeps the fragrance from going into the all-sweet territory and transports me somewhere in dark forests during the early fall.

BASE NOTES
When the fragrance dries down, Absolute moves into being a woody, earthy, musky, sappy, and even cozy fragrance. The woody characteristics are more intensified, more evident with smoky nuances.

To say that I was surprised by Gucci releasing something like this, and also praise the creative decision to be different in the sea of clones, and similar perfumes.

Guilty Absolute pour Homme,05/07/2024,manlyscents,M,96,,3,"Weird, but good stuff","An (in)famously challenging frag by Gucci. All about leather, wood, and vetiver... but it's also like smelling Stop n Grow nail-biting deterrent solution in front of a fireplace. I'm not gonna fake that I can describe it better than that. Weird, but good stuff. Murderous in the heat.

Guilty Absolute PH was doomed from the start. Consumers in retail stores only care for the very first minute of the opening, that's all the window of opportunity a fragrance gets to make them fall in love. Many of us who own a bottle of this had to try it out 2-3-4 times before we realized we even liked it. The challenge is what kept us going back. The average consumer doesn't want a challenge - at all. Side note: Funny that many reviewers call this ""niche style"" simply because the perfumer tried to do something oustide the norm. Goes to show the sorry-ass state of designer perfumery these days.

Projection is good and it lasts forever and a day.

But I should not get greedy . It stays for very long on clothes though. For some reason I think I also get something floral which I cannot identify. It projects decently but it's not to be used in high heat. This is going to stay with me for a very long time."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,10/19/2021,FantOmaSS,M,35,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Perfect !!,"I will get to the heart of the matter.
I will not recommend this perfume to everyone because it is not easy to wear.
That said it suits me very well.
It's nice to see a perfume with such powerful smells, but without being overwhelming for the wearer.
In other words it is a wonderful scent.
I had managed to get a sample in perfumery, and i fell in love...
A beautiful ""medicinal"" leather scent.
It won't suit many of you who won't consider it a regular scent.
It's very tough, dark, smoky, daring, unconventional fragrance.
Certainly not a sweet scent.
I do not recommend it at all to young people who are new to the world of fragrances.
Top notes mainly include leather.
The heat is made from patchouli and the base captures the goldwood and vetiver.
Created using a particular blend with a structure that remains unchanged since its first application on the skin, the leather accord and the goldwood are mixed with the natural extract of Nootka cypress, specially selected for this Guilty Absolute.
The resulting scent features dry woody notes.
The composition of the fragrance is intensified with three forms of patchouli oil and earthy vetiver.
Exceptional longevity and huge sillage.
In other words, it's heavy !!
It's powerful, it lasts a very long time...
Between 8 and 10 hours on me.
Small advice: Do not have a heavy hand at the risk of seeing those around you suffocate... You have been warned in advance.
To give you an idea of the smell of this Guilty Absolute, it smells like the worker coming home from the factory.
It reminds me of sawdust, grease, machine tools covered with metal shavings, or the auto repair shop.
Buy as many as you can, as it will soon be difficult to get hold of.
Conclusion: A perfume of a great class, powerful, but not for everyone.
Test it before buying it blindly i recommend it.
For me it is a total success, but by no means recommendable to beginners as with sensitive noses.
With this Guilty Absolute it's not very complicated.
You will love it or hate it.
My rating: 9/10"
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,02/27/2023,Thatbwoy,M,100,,10,"I'm just here for the leather, the rest I don't care...","I as grow older a discovery has revealed itself to me; not to give a shit and it's very liberating. Almost cathartic as when you realise that as a 40 something man you are almost/practicably ‘invisible’ to people younger than you (this is apparently true...they did some kind of study), and if so inclined to foolishly go around either trying to prove your ‘visibility’ to young women or your ‘machismo’ to younger guys; it can be summed up as.

Frivolous, futile and fuckry.

Far happier to just not care. Indulge in your interests and hobbies, like I don’t care about what is happening in any current zeitgeist. I’m not concerned about being on trend, I don’t waste any time wondering if the music I listen to is in any way popular. I don’t care if some 20 something woman finds me attractive or if some 20 something man thinks he ‘could beat the shit’ out of me (probably could but I don’t care, it's an irrelevance). I really wished I had this level of low energy in my teens and early twenties as I could have done so much more with my time.

I realised way too late the true meaning of not really caring, what that actually means; I thought, wrongly, in my late 30s that it meant, just schlubbing around in a t-shirt and a pair of tracksuit bottoms and a battered pair of trainers. Nah that’s ‘giving up’; that’s resignation, never again. I decided that I would live my life how the fuck I wanted and do what I want. I could not waste time worrying about the considerations toward others if it meant that I would be constantly living miserable and hypocritically. I have been teaching my daughter to be singularly and individualistically proud of herself, her drive and desire to pursue her happiness.

As I get older I have realised that you waste so much time contemplating the reactions, and thoughts of others that it becomes restrictive. Your actions, tastes, fashions, politics and council governed by imagined prejudices and tolerances? All of this to end up on a box leaving a trail of sympathy and polite indifference to your death.

But I’m not dead yet. I have been reading up on different schools of thought in philosophy. And I tripped up on ‘Egoism’ - now I could go all in and explain what it is but I’m two Long Island Ice Teas in and well I’m trying to listen to The Pharcyde’s ‘Labcabincalifornia’ and before that the lyrics to Paul Simon’s ‘Call me Al’ started to relate... so the Egoist does not concern themselves with the notions of state, property, religion ‘a good cause, a doctrine, a system, a lofty calling’ nope they just live for themselves and its part of this whole Individualism thing I’m scoping out.

Now how does this parlay with Gucci Guilty Absolute...well it goes like this: I have had my gripes about this sub and one that really annoys me is the trend of people asking others for their opinions on fragrances bought/ordered. Why? My opinion on a fragrance is mine and means nothing to you; this review, long winded and a sprawling of simile and metaphors. Why do these people care? I know some might say ‘Well they might not be confident enough with fragrances...’

SAMPLE THEN!!

Now the other reason; I had been after a leather fragrance for some time and was let down by some of the offerings by some of the big names and the older classics felt a little lacklustre. I kind of stumbled on to Gucci by accident. I was in Boots and I had asked to have a sniff of Gucci Guilty and the disinterested shop assistant handed me Gucci Guilty Absolute...the love was instant, especially as she baulked at the scent. I was in love I didn’t care about her opinion. I wanted it, I didn’t care. I had found my leather scent.

Gucci Guilty Absolute is that type of fragrance – it is leather! Big bastarding leather...it’s very leather. I LOVE IT because it is so ‘fuck off leather’ it does not hide the fact that this is a leather scent in aura of florals, or aldehydes or boozy scents. Nah! This is like those old-style plumber’s tool bags, this is what Lee Marvin’s leather jacket stank like on the set of the ’Wild Ones’. I would like to compare this to Tuscan Leather but I think that would be unfair as I would have a bias and I am not really a fan of Tuscan leather to me it smells like a trussed-up lady’s handbag left to bake on the passenger seat of an old 1985 Austin Maestro. Tuscan leather softened with trances of fruit and saffron, that it gives it a matinee idol aspect, all sucked in cheeks and gut, furrowed brows and pursed lips like Bruce Willis, on screen bravado and swagger.

Gucci Guilty Absolute is nothing like that, it’s the Uncle who turns up to family gatherings with a new “""half his age what’s thinking about” girlfriend; the mothers, wives and aunts are a little intimidated by. Gucci Guilty Absolute is the bassist in the pub rock band who’s sleeping with the lead singer’s girlfriend, the mechanic that works out of a shack/garage with no name but does great work, the chef who works on the line, who can barely spell any of the ingredients has that one knife that looks like it was rescued from the Marie Rose but can cook like an artist. The Cow that inspired the leather not of this scent, fucks, this is the stench of the leather jacket of the kid that bullied the Fonz, this is the scent of Freddie Kruger’s hat... Theophilus P. Wildebeeste’s leather trousers.

I know there’s other notes in this, I don’t care I’m here for the leather. I have decided that it's all I want from this and it delivers. I’m not after compliments, I’m not concerned with what others think I couldn’t care less. I just love being surrounded by this fug."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,11/13/2022,Razvanyke,M,215,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,One of a kind monster,"Before reading this review, I do hope you had the chance to smell this creation ... now we can talk about it.

This one, Tragedy of Lord George, Acqua di GIO EDT .. and many other scents on the market, let us understand the genius of Alberto Morillas, master perfumer.

This scent, the GUCCI one is a very strong, dark, deep OUD like scent without any mention about the expensive oil, but with a natural aspect to it, that makes me even wonder why we do need to kill the Agarwood trees anymore, if such a note can be done without any trace of it in a scent.

Let me tell you about longevity .. guys, this is beyond beast, this is nuclear .. I sprayed twice on the back of my hands yesterday around 14:00 and today at 18:00 it is still quite present as a skin scent, with one shower inbetween.

It smells rich and complex, not for the novice and not initiated in heavy duty scents .. this scent DNA leads me to believe that Alberto Morillas simply created a work without a specific marketing brief from COTY/GUCCI .. he shows us here how parfumery should be done.

This is not what you would call a mass pleaser and surely it did not come from a marketing team or AI like the idiot Phantom from Paco Rabanne.

Mr. Morillas, chapeau!"
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,10/13/2021,Patxetas,M,1,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Leather shoes,"Leather with cypress smells like a new shoebox, a very masculine linear fragrance. Niche quality designer, commercial failure in its day but a very interesting fragrance... Created by Alberto Morillas for me it is in his top-3.
If you like leather I think it is something that you should have in your collection, it does not project too much but its duration is good around 8-10 hours"
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,09/14/2024,Ceesie,M,132,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Wear with confidence,"To be honest, when I first smelled this, I wasn’t too sure about it. Wow that’s animalic. It reminded me of ""Signature Collection - Agar Wood | Dunhill"" big time and I don’t really like that one even though I own it.

But having read some reviews on it it’s got me interested and I dared to spray it on. It actually smells really nice and smooth on the skin. Nothing pungent. A bit dirty but that makes you feel great. “You don’t have to like it. I like it.” It’s nothing like the Dunhill frag. That one tries to keep the dirtiness hidden under a layer of sweetness. The Gucci doesn’t hide it at all.

It’s also a comforting scent. I had farmers in the family and I remember going there as a kid. Being grown up in the city, I found all that cow poo stinky. Don’t be ridiculous, my parents would say. That’s nature’s smell. Of course this frag isn’t as stinky as that but I got those flashbacks nonetheless.

So it won’t give you compliments if that’s what you’re after. I wouldn’t necessarily wear it to the office or at parties. It’s more of an in-and-around-the-house kind of thing."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,02/11/2018,Vmaster,M,35,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Gucci Guilty Absolute pour Homme,"A niche-like fragrance from a designer house? I am loving this!

For the longest time I have been tired of designer perfume houses playing it safe with the same old fresh and bland crap fragrances that they have been inundating consumers with. Gucci's new director is like a breath of fresh air for the designer fragrance industry.

Guilty Absolute is a wonderful and satisfying linear masculine leather fragrance that will last all day on your skin and at least a week on your clothes!

If you like fresh and safe fragrances, go elsewhere. If you like a different or avant garde leather fragrance, this is for you.

A solid 10/10"
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,07/02/2021,Eletus,M,31,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,"Leather intrepid, industrial, flat and robust","I can't believe that Alberto Morillas is behind this fragrance and has dared so much to break traditional watery, woody notes. It is difficult to understand this gem, here the leather is the real protagonist, it is rough, raw, not animalic, intrepid, industrial, flat and robust, there are no notes that truly highlight its composition to make it shine and take it to a splendor of mystery, of seduction. This fragrance resembles the solvents used in saddlery for the treatment of leather, if it remains on the clothes gives the feeling of having passed a cloth with liquid varsol giving that feeling of petroleum hydrocarbons, is completely linear and does not present any evolution, I would have liked more prominence of cypress, also vetiver to push towards the herbal or perhaps a citrus note in its top or in its base.
I would have liked a bit more of cypress, also vetiver to push towards the herbal or perhaps a citrus note in the top or in the middle, this would have given it the twist needed to make it more bearable.

So don't expect any compliments because to wear this misunderstood one needs character and to be confident. I gave it a chance but I couldn't, it gave me olfactory fatigue, I'm really sorry don Alberto M, I'll stick with other more wearable and interesting leather fragrances like Tuscan Leather, La Yuquawam Pour Home, Acqua di Parma Leather, Saharian Wind, Aoud Leather Montale.

For collectors buy a bottle because it is on sale and has become difficult to obtain.

Guilty Absolute pour Homme,01/05/2020,Golcher,M,139,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,A manly and bold winner,"I own and love Gucci Guilty Intense which is a very safe and crowd pleasing release but in the opposite side of the spectrum we have Guilty Absolute with even better results.

Guilty Absolute is bold, it doesn't care about trends or what's fashionable, it's by no means a fragrance for the younger folks. Absolute just doesn't care what's hot and what's not in fact it is almost certain to upset a lot of people and that's the beauty of it.

I found it at a local store, for some reason I was drawn to the tester and sampled it and it blew my mind. Such a realistic leather accord masterfully blended with gorgeous Vetiver, Woods and even a touch of Cypress so I took it home but that's not the end of it, next day I tested it again on skin and it is even better! Paper does NO justice what so ever to Absolute!

Scent is great, longevity is off the charts, sillage is moderate (which is fine, you don't want to be loud with this one) so yes, this is a 'Love' for me"

-rain filled ashtray
-used transmission oil
-a dirty leather jacket

Create a scene in your head by these circumstances. My brain actually blew up.
This one sticks out of Gucci’s crowd so hard, and even unexpected from Morillas, I didn’t know ‘this side’ of him until now. What a positive disappointment.

To be honest, this scent is not for everyone and not for every occasion.

It lasts for days on clothes...
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,10/08/2021,Fajrianto,M,13,,4,Solid Scent,"Guilty Absolute Pour Homme isn’t that challenging. It opens a bit medicinal, followed by a realistic leather. It’s not too animalistic. Woody and the vetiver come later. It’s well blended but lacks scent development. 6+ hours longevity, and moderate projection. This scent is bold and perfect to show “who’s the boss here”

I would wear this on formal occasions to give a statement. A solid release from Gucci. Sadly this gem rumored has been discontinued."

Guilty Absolute pour Homme,01/04/2024,Bodomic,M,8,,4,Guilty Absolute: Different and Straightforward,"This is a tough one: I'm dealing with a good, unusually weird, and (drumroll please...) amiable scent.

Brief disclaimer: If you're visiting this page, you are certainly a frag person who's perfectly capable of discerning wearable from unwearable. You may like or not like the scent, but don't dare typing ""Invictus people run from this; This is for alphas; Challenging af.""

First half an hour is my most uncherished stage from the whole way. All chemicals blazin' in there. Say you may get to feel the cypress, coumarin and whatnot by drawing your nose near enough; but it's all about the synthetic leather. I always get a fresh vibe with synthetics even this was meant as a warm scent. Once that stage's over, nothing remains ""on top"", and the fragrance becomes all about depth and perseverance. Subtly reminiscent of polished old / vintage seats, still in good condition, matching the brown of its own presentation. And just like that the fragrance dries down with an above-average performance.

All in all, it's perfectly wearable as said, it's a great reminiscent scent, almost photorealistic if you will. It's tremendously linear and plane, but it really doesn't need to stand out in any way, or through any accord.

Thing is, photorealism is not my vibe. Yet, I keep smelling my arm more often than I care to admit, because Gucci Guilty Absolute is a freaking addicting fragrance. However, I've worn it a couple of times, and it doesn't strike me as the fragrance that you want to keep smelling through your journey. In conclusion, it's a fantastic scent that I have to turn down."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,11/16/2017,AromaX,M,33,,2,From a cowshed to a leather jacket,"What can you find in a bottle:

* On a blotter it opens with a civet-like note which is almost shocking. Something rather to expect within a niche range of perfumes than in a mainstream scent. Camels, horses and cowsheds may come into the mind, though oud is not mentioned here. But on the skin it becomes less zoo-like and brings warm and sensual depth into the fragrance.
* An intimate close to skin scent what you might smell under a worn out leather jacket on a bare male skin. The jacket seems to keep the history of its wearer. Just a few nuances like mineral notes of oil and gasoline or residues of modern fougère perfumes and woody scents ingrained into leather.
* A very comforting warm and dry woody base.
* A slightly metallic aromatic vibe recognizable from many modern masculine fougère fragrances.

Some facts:

Woodleather® is a new Firmenich captive with an oud scent profile. Also used in “Original Oud” by Mizensir, the fragrance project by Alberto Morillas.

Goldenwood® is another Firmenich captive. As long as it’s under patent protection (as well as Woodleather®), not much information will be revealed.

Nootka cypress (also known as Alaskan Cedarwood) is a conifer growing in the Northwest Rainforest area. Firmenich describes the smell of Cedarwood Alaska essential oil as “sparkling with a fresh and breezy grapefruit crisp due to its Nootkatene and Nootkatone content (grapefruit odorants)”and “less camhoraceous and smoky, but stronger, longer lasting and more linear than the regular Cedarwood oil”."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,12/25/2023,Pokeapple,M,1,,2,Model T in the Desert,"This smells like an old car. The leather seats, the smell of engine oil and gasoline, even a subtle rubbery smell. The opening has a refreshing cypress note that I wished stayed longer. After about a half hour on my skin, the scent dries to a aged brown leather smell and the gassy, engine oil notes come out more. It stays just like that to the end of its life.

I wish there were maybe some more floral notes to give it some softness while keeping the dryness. But I think this is a great layering scent since it doesn't change much."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,07/23/2023,DrKong,M,45,,2,Leather for men.,"Its output is leather in a strong and naturalistic note, which is credible and understandable, a little later a smoky aroma that smells of fuel is incorporated, creating an atmosphere and environment that provokes curiosity, due to the unusualness of a fragrance, it remains in this development for a long time, and later some woods with Vetiver are also incorporated, which make it elegant as well as interesting, since the initial sensation will not leave us throughout the life and trajectory of the perfume.

Within the Cuero family fragrances, it is one of the most defined, it is not from the Tom Ford lines or others, and I think it has been and is appreciated by perfumery lovers, even those who consume what we call niche today.

But, it is also true that the general public has not embraced it with enthusiasm, and therefore I doubt that its sales have been profitable, it is true that since its launch on the market it has not had expansive marketing, in Department Stores it was as if it were hidden. It has never been sold in famous perfumery chains. Possibly more accessible on the web than in a physical store, where there is no fitting room.

Undoubtedly a very good fragrance, which always arouses curiosity and interest."

Guilty Absolute pour Homme,09/15/2023,AugustoB,M,31,,2,A weird way to smell good?,"As happens so often, there is so much hype about a fragrance that we fall in it. I fell on this Gucci. From the start it seemed to me like a super aggressive aroma, I never managed to understand it, I couldn't say that it is gross nor nasty , but I couldn't say that it is a pleasure to smell it either. It reminds me of shoe polish, the smell in those leather stores where they sell leather horse riding accessories, boots, bows, etc. Intense, rough, dark dry, striking. I have some perfumes with a leather note, I like it, but not this. After a year without taking it out of the closet, they decided to sell it, and despite it being ""a gem"", and being discontinued, people did not dare to buy it either. I changed it for a Terre de Hermes pure parfum, for me a deal. There are many who love this perfume, but not me. Separate note, the master Morillas recently designed the Terrae Escense for Bvlgari, it is for me a version of Gucci, with a sweet touch, more present vetiver, and some earthy notes; It's really a lovely scent, much friendlier to my nose and it's truly a pleasure to use.

Guilty Absolute pour Homme,11/03/2025,MagicMeiko,M,25,,1,Let's finally address the elephant in the room - is GGA the same as Dark Lord?,"If you check the fragrances Guilty Absolute pour Homme and Dark Lord - Ex Tenebris Lux , you'll see a VERY large amount of votes in the ""similar fragrances"" section. People love to compare these two, and I totally understand why:

- both fragrances are made by the same perfume, Alberto Morillas
- Guilty Absolute pour Homme came out one year before Dark Lord - Ex Tenebris Lux and Kilian as a brand does have a tendency of getting ""inspired""
- both have a very similar leathery vibe (?)

As an absolute (haha) lover of Dark Lord - Ex Tenebris Lux , I am aware that it's expensive - and that's why I rarely wear it. I've been on the hunt for a leather fragrances that captures that unique feeling that I get from Kilian's fragrance... and all paths seem to lead me to Guilty Absolute pour Homme . But are they the same? And is Dark Lord - Ex Tenebris Lux just a ""scam""?

After owning both fragrances and testing them back to back, here's my verdict: Nope, they're not the same BUT they have SOME similarities.
Dark Lord - Ex Tenebris Lux is like a black dark leather jacket: it's still a new polished jacket, smells a bit like gasoline but there's a subtle floral touch to it that really gives it some elegance and mystery - it's so intriguing!
Guilty Absolute pour Homme has a leathery vibe that is SUPER close to No Limit$ - they probably use similar leather ingredients because here I really smell a similarity. That leathery vibe is different in Dark Lord - Ex Tenebris Lux - it's more cold. The leather accord of Guilty Absolute pour Homme is warmer! It's much more woody and is rather linear in it's performance: it does one thing well, leather AND woods!
Dark Lord - Ex Tenebris Lux starts more classy masculine: bergamot in the opening, jasmine-esque florals bring some life to the composition and that leather binds everything together!

But here's the kicker: as Dark Lord - Ex Tenebris Lux dries down, it gets closer and closer to Guilty Absolute pour Homme !
Let's finish this off by mentioning that I enjoy both fragrances! Dark Lord - Ex Tenebris Lux has a special place in my heart, as it was my first big niche fragrance that I fell in love with, so at the end of the day, nothing can really compare to that ;)

But Guilty Absolute pour Homme is essentially a ""warmer drydown of Dark Lord - Ex Tenebris Lux "", that's what it feels like. Definitely more woody and warmer, it's more cozy in it's take on leather in perfumery - which I find awesome, as a lot of leather perfumes tend to go in that ""new polished black leather jacket"" vein. And of course, that price difference is immense. Whether it's worth it to you or not, noone can really say. You have to try them for yourself.
My preference is clear, I have a favorite. But if I want to get a similar feeling AND I want it woodier on a particular day, I'd go with Guilty Absolute pour Homme instead."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,05/30/2017,Leimbacher,M,2870,,38,Gucci has found its balls again,"Since Tom Ford's departure, Gucci has mostly been releasing watered-down, design-board fragrances, especially in the Guilty line, and now this... lecko mio! Is this the turnaround? ""Gucci Guilty Absolute"" is absolutely amazing and the opposite of its siblings. I stink, therefore I live!!!

""Guilty Absolute"" is a stinker of the highest order, completely brushed against the mainstream, fresh out of the stable, more Hermes than Gucci, leather to the max - and I totally love it! If you're into leather scents, there's little comparable even in the niche. Top-notch quality, masculine, striking, a huge step out of the comfort zone for Gucci - wonderful! One can only praise it enthusiastically. Already the positive surprise of the year in the designer sector. No one expected this, it hits you right in the face. Towards the end, it becomes more patchouli-like, but for the most part, it's an animalistic leather powerhouse without mercy. Unvarnished, unpolished, unrefined. I can hardly believe it. Here and there, a bit of synthetic notes peek through, but overall, it's a dream scent for me. Played, daring, won! It has nothing to do with the other Guiltys and should carry its own name.

Bottle: simple and high-quality - the exterior has never been the problem...
Sillage: strong as a stud
Longevity: some leather jackets last shorter - 12 hours!

Conclusion: the best and wonderfully grimmest Gucci for men in years. Gucci is back... let's hope it wasn't a fluke!"

Guilty Absolute pour Homme,12/07/2020,Lumberjack,M,3,,19,Only dead fish swim with the current,"In a world where everyone wears classic “blue” fragrances, which to me smell like any random sports shampoo, I see myself as a stubborn provocateur when it comes to perfumes. After years of trying to follow the mainstream and finding pleasure in those universally popular scents like Sauvage, Armani Code, and all the others that have dominated the TOP20 in every drugstore and contributed to a uniform general smell in discos and clubs for years, I must sadly admit that I simply do not like them and cannot wear them.

This led to a growing desire within me to swim against the current so as not to be one of those dead fish.
Since TF Tobacco Oud has been my signature scent for over a year and the discontinuation of its production has been troubling me for the past two months, I have been intensively searching for an alternative “In your face” scent.
It should be affordable, but different and provocative.

I liked GGA back in 2017, but at that time it was too much for me, and I wanted to please the girls, not scare them away.
This time I dared to test it intensively on my skin.
My God, it smells so good. Provocative, rough, masculine, simply different.

GGA is, for me, the outlaw among perfumes. Extreme niche for little money (I got it on sale for a mere 40 euros for 90ml).
You smell completely different from the mainstream. This scent has nothing sweet, fresh, or citrusy.
Just leather, wood, and a bit of whisky and smoke. A scent that you must wear with a lot of self-confidence.

For me, it is not a scent for a casual leather jacket and biker boots; that would be too much of a cliché.
Like TF TO, this is a scent for a suit, for a shirt, for more elegant outfits. You may stone me, but it works fantastically.

Perhaps it is also because I live in Eastern Europe and here the women seem to be particularly attracted to a lot of masculinity, but the scent brought me, just like TF TO, consistently positive, almost enamored compliments.
For me, it is an absolute aphrodisiac for a man (25+) with a lot of self-confidence and a certain “aura” of an educated alpha male, a lone wolf who has everything under control, always knows the answer, and despite his animalistic demeanor, is a certain gentleman.
This image of a man, tall, masculine, elegantly dressed, who enters a room and silence reigns, admiration and awe fill the air, that’s the kind of scent it is. You are provocatively different, but not in a banal way, rather thoughtfully and elegantly.

A strong gasoline and whisky accord for me in the first 15 minutes, which transitions into a leathery, woody scent and loses the leather over the coming hours, replaced by subtle herbs.

Not a blind buy, not a scent for skinny, short guys with little self-confident aura; this scent would be as out of place on such a man as CK One would be on me."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,05/10/2021,Tats,F,13,,23,Authentic Leather ... delicious,"This is the third time I've mustered the courage to write a review. Actually, I have nothing to add to my predecessors. Twice when I wanted to write something ... wanted to share ... I thought, ""Oh no, everything has really been said.""
I have tested many of my decants lately. Also yesterday and today, which made me place an order right away.

But at the end of the day, I sit here alone with Guilty.

I got myself a bottle of this fragrance. I immediately decanted some for when I'm working or studying and want to sniff a scent; Guilty is right next to me. Totally happy after my tested perfumes from today, I found myself back at my desk. I see the Guilty decant, I’m pleased about it, I smell it. Mhhhhh. Simply delicious.

My surroundings have already pointed out the scent to me. Why do I smell so strange, it somehow smells like a cow shed or fertilizer.
I sit here, ready to go to sleep, wrapped in Guilty. I don’t smell cow shed or fertilizer.

I smell leather. Leather that might not be associated with black patent leather shoes. But leather, in cognac color, leather that is smooth but matte on the outside. Inside, it has more of a rough texture. Maybe a bit like the old rectangular leather backpacks.

I can't really perceive the patchouli; I can't say anything about all the other notes either, but I believe the main role here is played by the wood leather. The scent is totally linear. When I spray the scent on my hand in the evening, I can still perceive the wood leather in the morning. The scent diminishes, it is noticeable but weak. Mainly, in the morning, I perceive a kind of spiciness that I would describe as peppery.
The scent lasts long, yet I was constantly searching for a fragrance that I was just as addicted to, a scent that remains just as consistently dirty, a scent with perhaps more depth and something more complex and even longer-lasting or with more sillage.
I searched, asked many perfumers who already have many leather scents.

But to be honest, none of them have been it so far. I got to know many leather fragrances (thanks to the perfumers) that are good and that I will also acquire. But none was like Guilty.
In the end, I got to try the similar scent from Kilian - Dark Lord. The opening of both is indeed similar. But only for a minute. While Guilty is totally linear, the Kilian scent is really very complex and changes. After a few minutes, the scents no longer resemble each other for me.
I'm not saying that the Kilian scent is bad because of that, no, not at all. I think it is more socially acceptable. Not a crowd-pleaser, but ... perhaps more pleasant for other noses than Guilty.
I find Guilty really delicious and it has a very unique character compared to what I've smelled so far. It smells delicious; you can't ignore the scent, it is present and shows very confidently that it is there.
Whoever wants authentic leather will be well served here, but should bring a dose of healthy self-confidence.

Just like the motto: If it's too strong, you're too weak.

Good night."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,04/11/2017,Maxi3000,M,20,,13,Ledrig®! Holzig®! Mitsubishi®!,"It seems that the responsible parties have finally noticed: Gucci's rather unfortunate ""Guilty"" line has not stood out for its overwhelming creativity or quality. The now fifth offshoot ""Absolute"" is trying to strike a completely new tone - moving away from the orange blossom drugstore sugary water nonsense, towards everything that a ""real man"" is supposedly required to enjoy: dirt, wood, leather, lush vegetation. To what extent this aligns with the existing ""Guilty"" customer base remains to be seen. Either way, the new Gucci leaves me with a big question mark.

The reason I can't quite warm up to the newcomer is that it doesn't deliver what it wants to sell you as a feeling, but also due to its somewhat unorganic execution. Gucci has, like many other brands, drawn from the aroma cocktail resources of Firmenich and other consorts for ""Absolute."" Why buy several different raw materials when you can have spicy, woody, and creamy in one fragrance note? These fantasy notes are then called Akigalawood®, or Clearwood®, in this case Goldenwood® and Woodleather®. They already ruin a large part of the Comme des Garcons scents for me, and even with Guilty Absolute, they create a strangely synthetic scent impression: leather, wood, smoke, it’s all there, but in an almost sterile-aseptic execution. I smell not well-worn vintage leather seats, but rather a production-fresh new car with faux leather seats. A bit like the mid-range cars in the Mitsubishi dealership that settled in our street during my childhood. Throughout the scent development, one note or another occasionally wafts to the forefront, until the patchouli-like (?) nuances assert themselves in the base.
For a dark, leathery scent, the physical, human, ""dangerous"" aspect is completely absent. I have the impression that Gucci didn't want to completely alienate its existing ""Guilty"" clientele, resulting in a perfume for clean-scent wearers who also want to appear a bit naughty. ""Guilty Absolute"" recites masculine macho perfume clichés from the powerhouse and Fahrenheit era, yet remains strangely clinical and lifeless.

When wearing it, I envision - and I hope no one feels offended! - that urban male archetype who works in marketing or advertising in the big city during the week and then drives to the pre-Alps on the weekend with a Mitsubishi Pajero® to engage in some ""manly activities"" in nature. On one hand, for his own compensation and self-affirmation, and on the other hand, because he believes society still expects these old stereotypes. But it could also just be a malicious assumption on my part. ;)

The new Gucci is certainly much better than its botched ""Guilty"" siblings. But if I want the ultimate Genghis Khan feeling with leather-cedar magic, I'd rather get ""Knize Ten"" by Knize or ""Gomma"" by Etro. They embody their masculinity, but in a much more nuanced and heartfelt way."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,02/09/2021,Stefanoleng,M,17,,16,Honor where honor is due,"When looking at the comments and ratings for this fragrance, it becomes clear that there are only extremes. Either the Gucci is mercilessly punished with 1 to 2 points, or it is highly praised. There isn’t much in between. It’s surprising that it still manages to achieve a relatively good average score of 7.5. I find it commendable that Gucci has released such an individual scent. It probably won’t be the biggest commercial success. This piqued my curiosity. So off I went to Kaufhaus Müller (which has kept its perfume department open despite the lockdown). There stood a lonely bottle of Gucci Guilty Absolute and a tester.
I must admit I fell in love with the scent immediately. I haven’t smelled anything like this in designer fragrances for a long time. I immediately bought the 90ml bottle. I have been wearing the fragrance non-stop for 4 days now and I am still thrilled. It’s cold outside and there’s a lot of snow. I’m wearing the warmest and softest leather scent I know. It fits perfectly for winter. The way this fragrance smells, it should smell when you get into your brand-new Rolls Royce. Finest leather and the noblest woods. The dirty and animalistic notes described in some comments are not how I perceive it. I find the scent soft and elegant. In my perception, it is a so-called ""skinscent."" The projection is already subdued and very discreet after about an hour. The scent lies close to the skin and exudes its warm and soft aura. In the drydown, woody and boozy accents join the leather. But otherwise, I would describe the scent as very linear. There is no pronounced scent development. This fragrance is definitely not worn for others or to gain compliments. This fragrance is worn for oneself. Because it projects only softly, I find it very versatile. I wear it now in the cold days even in the office. Gucci has managed to impress me with Guilty Absolute. For me, it is the winter fragrance of 2020/2021. I would be happy if more unique fragrances like this were released, even if they only appeal to 50% of buyers. We are all looking for something special and individual."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,05/17/2018,PBregovich,M,32,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,12,Replica,"When I withdrew money in the city center today to possibly have change for a private sale of sunglasses, I received a call that the buyer unfortunately couldn't come after all. Well, on one hand, that was annoying, but on the other hand, I could check out the Türkisen again to see if they finally have something new. Unfortunately, I usually stay one step ahead of the stores in Austria and could only find the new Annayake (insignificant) among the untested.
So I walked through the shelves, as I didn't want to go home without a scent on my wrist. Then I spotted Gucci Guilty Absolute and remembered the first time I tested it on a paper strip: Ugh, no, not at all. However, in the meantime, I have also tested other leather fragrances and expanded my fragrance horizon as well as my fragrance tolerance a bit. So off to Test 2 directly on the wrist.
The beginning is as shocking to me as it was the first time. You get the full force of Woodleather *registered trademark symbol* in your face and have to pause for a moment. But since I tested it on a paper strip last time, I let it develop. Gradually, something floral emerges, almost herbal. The extremely scratchy and powerful aspect fades away over time, but the leather scent is definitely still there.
While La Yuqawam pour Homme reminds me of a freshly bought leather jacket worn by a girl with raspberry perfume, Guilty Absolute gives me the already mentioned leather couch flavor. However, this is not a new couch for me, but one that has been well-used. Mixed with the aromas of the living room, the regular use of Febreze that mom uses to cover up her occasional smoking, which never really goes away. Guilty Absolute reminds me of the smell of taxis in Sofia, which roast with leather interiors at 40°C in the sun and later take you from traffic jam to traffic jam to your destination.
With all these memories, it almost surprises me that we are talking about Gucci here. Considering how insignificantly uninteresting the other flankers have been so far. One could almost think that this is a fragrance that Replica would have liked to release.

REPRODUCTION OF FAMILIAR SCENTS AND MOMENTS OF VARYING LOCATIONS AND PERIODS
Originally: Balkan Taxi Drive
Provenance and Period: Sofia, 2007
Fragrance Description: Leather interior and Magic Tree
Style Description: ???

This brings me to my last point, which is wearability. Since I have been with Parfumo for almost a year now, I can appreciate fragrances that I personally do not like. I understand what can be refined about them and what others love about them. I see that here as well. It is a very authentic leather scent. However, I could never imagine wearing it myself. It wouldn't suit any of my acquaintances or relatives either. Maybe one could wear it on Halloween if one wants to dress up as Leatherface. Perhaps it would be advantageous during hide and seek, as you would blend in even less behind the neighbor's leather couch. Otherwise, I probably would never wear it.

At this point, a brief reminder to all those who might feel offended by my comment: This is, as always, just my own opinion and everything is subjective. I'm glad it could bring you joy."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,09/17/2019,AgnesEva,F,34,,15,"Like a punch in the face for some, great love for me.","This fragrance is highly polarizing. Great love or extreme hate with nothing in between, 50/50. Some feel almost offended by it. For me, however, it is the most wonderful, honest, impressive, astonishing leather of all time. Childhood. The original 50s bag from my father's binoculars, which I always played with. An inheritance from his great-uncle. GGA smells like the leather of that bag. Real leather from the 50s. Wonderful. A truly special experience. And it lasts and lasts, and the sillage is fantastic. I have the huge 200ml bottle. :)"
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,02/27/2024,Lucagabriel,M,6,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,19,68er Mustang Fastback,"I first smelled this fragrance a few years ago in Munich, and I liked it even then. Then our paths parted. The scent lingered on as a figment in my subconscious.

When I saw it again at Duty Free Stuttgart on my way to the flight to Barcelona, my hand instinctively moved towards the brown bottle with the small black cap.
Boom, the fragrance hit me like Muhammad Ali's right hand on Sonny Liston's jaw. A leather club before the Lord… And I love it. Just like I did a few years ago, but also completely different.

Only now, with the necessary background knowledge and significantly more “perfume experience,” did I recognize the full beauty and uniqueness of this scent.

A deep black gasoline note layered with leather. Like a '68 Mustang Fastback.
Brutal. Loud. Old school.
Not Alcantara leather from the new Porsche 911, like in Ombré Leather (2018) EAU DE PARFUM.
Leather more like: the old biker jacket of Uncle Jack, who used to ride with the Hells Angels on his Harley Davidson and drank a bottle of whiskey for breakfast. The jacket has burn holes; Uncle Jack was a cigar aficionado.

This symphony is initially accompanied by a slightly green-fresh cedar note. But then it disappears. The little green cedar sprout slowly grows into a tree after a few minutes, giving the fragrance a dark woody note.
The gasoline association, which I apparently share with other perfume lovers, fades but comes back every now and then.

After about half an hour to an hour, only old, crusty, time-worn but soft leather can be smelled.
CONCLUSION

My second bottle. I don't know anyone in my circle who likes it. I love it for that.

Designer fragrance with niche DNA.
Not a date scent. A scent to exude dominance. Not everyone can wear it. You have to be the type for it.
A leather jacket is almost mandatory.

Top fragrance, also great for layering with good H/S.
As a man with long hair, it often gets caught there; sometimes I still smell it in the shower after two days.
For a while, it was even my signature/daily scent.
“A fragrance for the individualist,” as I read here. Perfectly described."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,03/25/2021,MrPink,M,11,,19,The Boxers Through the Window,"Gucci Guilty Absolute is one of the most polarizing designer fragrances I know!
Moreover, it is also a strikingly atypical creation by Mr. Morillas, who, besides doing commissioned work for anyone who pays enough and wants to sell a mass-pleaser scent, is known as THE man for freshies and timeless classics like Acqua di Gio, Light Blue pH, and *ahem* Office.

It surprised me even more that such an uncompromising fragrance was created under his guidance. Because GGA is straightforward and direct, no flattering opening that gradually leads you to the harsh leather. Not particularly complex or with great development (which is typical for Morillas), but that’s exactly what makes it so interesting to me. A look at the notes gives a rough idea of where it’s headed. Vetiver, patchouli, cypress, wood leather, and golden wood - So leathery, woody, earthy. Check. This scent is pure and freshly tanned woody leather to spray on. Nothing more, nothing less.

When I smell the fragrance, I inevitably associate it with old leather and wood, strangely not in a bad way like the old wooden box lined with leather in grandma's decaying or dusty attic. Images of a rocker or some other stereotypical bad guy come to mind, who is forced by his wife to maintain his monthly personal hygiene. Sharpening his razor on leather, polishing his shoes on a solid wood table, and drinking Jacky straight from the bottle. This esteemed gentleman probably wears this fragrance, even if he doesn’t smell similar by nature.

For me personally, the scent is mostly unbearable, and I have only received negative comments so far - yet I still quite like it at times, because sometimes, but only sometimes, men like me deserve a bit of leather, uh, gladly… or something?!

This is a good fragrance for men who want to stand out, whether positively or negatively should not matter to them. For men who want to provoke or impregnate their leather jackets. For the men who, after two bottles of Jacky, will box anyone who gives them a hard time through the window. Uncompromising tough guys indeed."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,05/06/2020,Chizza,M,361,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,Leather Perfume - Leather for Beginners,"Yesterday, I took Guilty Absolute out of the cabinet again. This fragrance back then launched the rocket with one or two others, taking my designer fragrance experience beyond the well-known standards to the next level. In hindsight, and following the reviews here, it may be a bold choice; Gucci Absolute is not a guarantee of appeal. But why?

But let's start from the beginning: I actually have unintentionally acquired a few Morillas creations in my cabinet and must say: Guilty Absolute is an authentic and crowd-pleasing leather scent for beginners, making it a wonderful achievement by Mr. Morillas. It is linear, becomes slightly more robust, and does not overwhelm anyone. The weak H/S also contributes to this. It quickly becomes intimate and, unfortunately, disappointing if you are used to bathing in Tuscan Leather.

At first, it smells like leather soaked in sweet alcohol. It is charming and never too strong. For me, it is an absolutely polished scent without edges or corners. You feel like you are in a specialty leather goods store. Many attribute such a scent to more robust leather fragrances, but I must disagree. Those fragrances all smell like leather workshops where raw, coarse materials are used. Guilty Absolute is more like the leather of a new belt, a pair of leather shoes, or a leather bag. These are all appealing leather scents; customers do not buy leather that smells like a freshly deceased animal.

For this reason, I cannot share associations like musty, animalistic, and the like. There are quite different candidates for that, and this view can only be due to the fact that one knows little beyond designer fragrances.
There is not much more to say about the scent; it does not have many nuances and is characterized by the authentically scented trademark ingredients. At most, the vetiver as a wingman is recognizable, and the synthetic wood has also been downgraded to a supporter.

Therefore, Guilty Absolute is the entry into the world of leather; if this is too much or too animalistic for you, you are probably even worse off with other leather fragrances. If you like this but find it too smooth, you will move on."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,06/18/2018,Makaveli5,M,15,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,one punch mickey,"So... I haven't posted anything on parfumo for quite a long time. To be honest, there hasn't really been any new release in the last 2-3 years that prompted me to share my thoughts. But now the time has come. Well, I probably wouldn't write anything about the GGA (=Gucci Guilty Absolute) either, but I received the fragrance as a gift from my brother two days ago. And that by accident.
You see, (there's no umlaut a on my keyboard, so I always write with ae) I actually prefer the original Gucci Guilty compared to most people here. I just like the scent. Just the fragrance and the overall package with the bottle, color, packaging, Chris Evans, hairy chest, etc. I know the advertising achieved what it wanted ;)
Well, my brother went to the perfumery and wanted to buy me the Guilty Intense, but instead, he bought the Absolute, as I said, by accident. He handed me the bag, I took out the box, and lo and behold, it was a brown box instead of black. I knew what that meant because I had already tested the Gucci Absolute. Not even on the paper strip, let alone on my hand, but just sniffed it briefly at the spray head. That was enough for me :)

Boom... like a punch from One Punch Mickey aka Brad Pitt in the film classic ""Snatch"" by Guy Ritchie. Anyone who knows the film (I hope everyone does, if not, watch it right away, it's a cult) knows what I mean. You have to take a quick breath after the first sniff. The new Gucci (Okay, it's not that new either) knocks you off your feet. I think it’s mainly because nowadays, they don't really make such masculine fragrances anymore, except maybe in the niche market. It has absolutely nothing sweet or fresh about it like 99% of all men's fragrances today. It just smells mercilessly like... MAN. Maybe too much?

Hmm, definitely not for everyone. It smells very strong of leather and is definitely suitable for autumn and winter.
So I didn't even test it on my skin. It was just too off-putting for me.

Well, that's the one I got from my little brother :) He said he no longer had the receipt. So I had no choice but to tear off the outer foil and immediately give a spray on my hand. It turned out shortly after that he actually still had the receipt. What a drama.

I've had the fragrance for 2 days now and I must say... I can't stop smelling my hand.
Oh, and I should mention that the scents smell exactly the same on my skin as they do on a paper strip. So no development or anything. But I must say that this Gucci feels quite good on my skin. It becomes a bit softer. Not as extreme as from the bottle. It becomes a bit tamer. But just a bit. But that’s enough for me. Thus, it is wearable for me. However, the initial impact of the fragrance fades quickly. I would wish for a longer longevity and a bit better sillage.

Nevertheless, I am already looking forward to autumn ;) With a leather jacket and my suede boots, it will fit so well. So more suited to a rougher style of clothing.
I think it would also go very well with a suit and coat. However, I always associate brown leather with the fragrance (brown leather jacket, brown leather boots). It probably has to do with the color of the perfume.
You all know Gaultier's ""Ultra Male""... Ultra Male :D ..I have to grin every time at the name because it doesn't match the fragrance at all. Gaultier's ""Ultra Male"" is quite feminine. The designation ""ultra male"" really has no place there, but well. Advertising, I guess. What I want to say is, THIS GUCCI HERE deserves that name. I mean come on people, this fragrance from Gucci is testosterone times ten. At 30 years old, I feel 5 years older with this scent. It exudes masculinity and maturity. I'm sure this Gucci evokes just that in most people who then walk behind you on the street.

On the other hand, it divides opinions. Maybe some will even cross to the other side of the street. Such a thing is certainly not liked. Not that it has ever happened to me :D But I can imagine it.

As mentioned, I wasn't initially thrilled with the Guilty Absolute, but it only took 2 days for me to fall in love with it. I should also mention that it smells very high quality. At least to me. I've read the opposite here. However, it feels very natural to me.

Bottle, color of the juice, packaging... for me, everything is a feast for the eyes with this product. And the best part is, it will never be mainstream, I'm quite sure of that.

And lastly... if movies could smell, ""Snatch"" would definitely smell like Gucci Guilty Absolute, with its plot and all its characters. Above all, One Punch Mickey, Turkish & Frankie ""fucking"" four fingers.

In the end, it was a positive mistake ;)"
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,06/05/2017,Hayate1603,M,8,,11,Relentlessly Dominant Leather/Wood Brew,"I really like leather as a scent, very much so. However, I find it difficult with real leather fragrances. Tom Ford's Tuscan Leather is far too feminine for me because of its jasmine. Le Malé Essence by Gaultier is nice but sometimes too sweet. Royal Leather by Charriol is also nice, but why do I have to smell like dried plums with a leather scent?

Next up is Leather 6 by Schwarzlose. I find it strong, but for me, it already smells like sex in a darkroom, which is cool, but I don't need that every day. Then there were a few more experiences, and in the end, I landed on Acqua di Parma Leather. For me, that's really fine, noble leather. A leather scent that I can be happy with.

Now I have a good friend. Every few weeks, he meets up with some buddies for a kind of group sport. Every time he complained because he stood a meter away from a youth player who was drenched in 1 Million. You have to know, he doesn't like sweet scents at all. But 1 Million is quite intensely sweet, and the cloud always drifted over to him, so he could hardly concentrate on what he was doing. His desperation was so great that he sprayed everything he had on that 18-year-old in the hope of covering up the sweetness. Now he has Gucci Guilty Absolute... and the problem is gone, because against the leathery/woody scent of Gucci, even 1 Million can't compete anymore.

This friend told me about the fragrance, and it made me curious. When I discovered it in the perfumery, I had to try it right away, and upon the first sniff, I was... shocked!!!

Powerful, dominant. Burnt wood, old leather jacket, auto repair shop with a sweaty mechanic. If AcP Leather is the most elegant Italian version of capturing leather in a fragrance, then Gucci is the counterpoint.

I doubted my friend's nose for a week. How on earth could he like this? ... But I found something fascinating about the scent as well. So, for two weeks, I kept going to the perfumery during my lunch break and sprayed it on myself a few times, and lo and behold, a love developed.

This scent oozes self-confidence. It is not refined or elegant, let alone discreet. For me, this is also not a scent I would wear when going to work. But in the evening at the club or for anything that might happen afterward, it fits wonderfully. It is a bit dirty, very masculine, dominant, and sexy. It suits me for all age groups, except maybe for guys under 20, as that doesn't quite fit yet. But now in summer, sneakers, jeans, open shirt, three-day beard, and the style is ready for this scent.

I am grateful to my friend for introducing me to this fragrance. He has also introduced me to Himalaya by Creed and Oud Wood by Tom Ford. While Himalaya is a great scent for the morning, I believe I still couldn't handle Gucci at 9 AM, as I am not a morning person, and Oud Wood remains the king in the collection; it is a noble overall composition. But I have come to love Gucci Guilty Absolute."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,02/19/2022,ScentDon,M,7,,10,The Underrated Leather Whip!!!,"For the leather freaks - you have to test this scent..

I love this extreme leather touch that this fragrance has. It reminds me a bit of the smell at a gas station mixed with strong leather. In my opinion, it's an absolute must-have for every man!
The longevity is more than above average for me - the scent lasted up to 2 weeks on my clothes.. and even after the washing machine, faint notes of this fragrance come through

It actually appeals less to women, but more to male colleagues!
Although it must be said here that the scent repels many ""non-perfume enthusiasts,"" and they often perceive the scent as stinky.

In any case, a clear recommendation from me!"
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,01/27/2018,Fleurissimo,M,323,,9,Conifers and Leather,"""Gucci Absolute pour Homme"" reminded me at first sniff of the typical chypre leather fragrances with conifer resins and balsamic notes. The first wave hit the market in the 70s (""Polo"", ""Halston Z-14"", ""Yatagan"" etc.), and there was a revival in the 80s and 90s (""New West"", ""Globe"", ""DKNY Fuel Men"", ""Harley Davidson"" etc.)

The opening is characterized by intensely fragrant Mediterranean herbs (mugwort, thyme) - the scent has, apart from a bit of yuzu, no pronounced freshness component and starts off sweaty. Soon follows a floral-coniferous heart note with iris, jasmine, pine needle, cypress. The distinctly dry base note, devoid of any hint of vanilla or cinnamon sweetness, is dominated by leather, amber, styrax, patchouli, and vetiver.

Those used to today's creamy pudding notes will experience a culture shock with ""Gucci Absolute pour Homme."" I find it to be a likable retro scent and a real man - and it has a dark, murky note that reminds me alternately of a cemetery or a bedroom. It's exactly the type of character scent that is often missing nowadays. But you have to like it, as it truly has edges and corners. Similarities to ""Fahrenheit"" are rather limited, as the latter appears cleaner and, despite the leather note, actually has more in common with ""Grey Flannel"" (violet)."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,06/28/2022,Layne,M,2,,14,Must be wearable and above all desired,"This fragrance is a statement in itself. Of course, it doesn't reach the level of some niche scents in terms of uniqueness, but it is definitely more special than anything else from Douglas and Co.
For me, it has a relatively strong touch of motor oil, diesel, hex keys, and hard work - pure masculinity, in other words.
Whether one likes this DNA or not is up to each individual, personally I would rather keep my distance from this scent - unless you are a passionate biker looking for a suitable perfume for the next Harley meet.
But jokes aside, the fragrance doesn't do anything wrong in my eyes, after all, it is supposed and wants to be extravagant. However, one should be aware of its presence and not expect a ""What smells so good here?"" but rather a ""Did someone have a breakdown here?"""
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,04/16/2023,ElMare,M,29,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Sons of Anarchy,"I tested this expecting to find a typical modern generic designer fragrance in front of me. I anticipated a typical somewhat woody Gucci with a bit of leather that would surely please everyone in some way. What I got was a bit of a shock. :D

This scent will definitely not appeal to everyone, and it doesn't suit everyone, especially not for every occasion. The quite strong top note smells to me like gasoline, motor oil, and dirty worn leather. Something about it clearly reminds me of Fahrenheit, less so of the noble clean leather from TF Ombre Leather. Overall, it feels extremely masculine to me. A fragrance that I could see on some of the 'Sons' from the aforementioned series if they were in tattered leather vests working on their Harleys in the workshop. It doesn't come across as perfumey at all. Not much else comes through. The gasoline and oil fade a bit, but the dirty smoky leather remains. And that lingers quite a while.

I find it surprisingly good, but in my opinion, it is only wearable under certain conditions. A leather vest or at least a leather jacket is a must. The occasion should match as well. SAMCRO FOREVER. :D"

Synthetic scent materials, check.
On paper: No reason to consider this fragrance further.

But as so often, theory is just theory and reality is reality. Woodleather? Goldenwood? Who cares!

On the nose: Leather, and what a leather it is! Nasty? I wouldn't say so. But dominant. Uncompromising. Hovering above it: Gasoline, equally uncompromising. What a start! Sounds harsh? Maybe. Still, it is much more wearable than it might sound at first. This gasoline note is borderline and ultra-cool at the same time - that's quite an achievement.

Beneath the gasoline-soaked leather lies a foundation of solid wood, which supports it. Whether synthetic or natural doesn't matter here either. It supports. And it does so solidly and enduringly. Patchouli adds a soft, spicy sweetness. Still different. Refreshingly different.

Alberto Morillas, I bow to this Fast-and-Furious Gucci with gasoline in its blood!"
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,04/18/2022,Kriskwiat,M,8,,13,"Pure, it must be leather -","The only fragrances I review are those that possess a unique momentum.

This scent has managed to convince me of its nature right away. Deeply leathery and drenched in gasoline. Well, it's understandable that this is a smell not everyone loves - but that's often an inspiration for me. I give you the association; camel saddle.

It showcases the uniqueness of the thing itself. Perfume.

The scent remains constantly consistent in its DNA, long-lasting, yet never mutating into a beast.

For me, it is a classic leather fragrance in a classic form. Because when I personally look for a leather scent, it must first smell strongly of leather and in the next instance radiate something unique. It must have character. And this fragrance definitely has that."

I don't know if any of you are familiar with those leather-scented cardboard pieces that you can mount in your car or under the car seat to imitate the smell of new car leather (it only works if you have leather seats, right). They now have competition. That’s exactly what I thought when the top note burst of leather scent hit my nose. Leather in a new car, standing in the showroom combined with rubber and oil. And it continues like this from the top note to the end, with a little hint of wood (ash) left at the end. However, the fragrance softens a bit over time and moves away from the coarse thick buffalo leather towards finer Nappa;)

A scent for real (leather) guys and perhaps mechatronics engineers who don’t want to hide their profession even after work and when going out nicely. For me, it’s not a scent for a suit or in the office - unless you wear a leather tie with it:))) or are busy at Gucci in the leather goods department...

The whole thing is interesting, very specific, but as a fragrance, it’s not wearable for me due to a lack of imagination and usability for what occasion I would use it. Moreover, the linear scent progression and the overwhelmingly dominant leather note seem a bit monotonous to me, yet it is indeed (and finally again) a striking and masculine fragrance. It will surely find its buyers."

Guilty Absolute pour Homme,08/13/2020,ParfumDude,M,11,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Grandpa's Leather Jacket Meets Antique Wardrobe,"The title may initially sound strange or even negative, but it is indeed meant to be fully positive. I will try to explain how this comes about in my little review or rather my personal story about Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Homme.

My relationship with Guilty Absolute starts, as so often, with a sniffing session in the perfume store (guess which one?) where the bottle caught my attention more out of boredom than genuine interest, as the previous fragrances released under the Gucci Guilty label from Italian provenance had rather put me in a state of less pronounced ecstasy, to put it mildly. So I sprayed a bit of the delicious dark brown juice onto a tester and held it to my nose with rather low expectations - and I was completely taken aback!

Where I had expected something between shower gel freshness and synthetic sweetness, suddenly leather hit me! And wood! And something gasoline-petroleum-like! I did not expect that, and I must say that the scent initially overwhelmed me a bit - animalistic, leathery, woody, and bone dry... that is not an easy cocktail that Gucci has pumped into the bottle.

So I looked further, initially categorizing the leather colleague as ""a bit much,"" went home, and that was the end of the story. Or was it? Somehow, I just couldn’t get the scent out of my head, and every time I spotted it on a perfume shelf, I had to smell it again. And again. And again. Until I finally bought it (thanks to its apparently rather low popularity, it is relatively inexpensive to find) and have been wearing it ever since, whenever the weather and mood allow.

Okay, long story, many words, but how does the biker jacket perform on the church bench in practice? In fact, it is less intense than I initially thought. It is certainly recognizable as a leather-wood scent, but it is also pleasantly warm and rounded and above all - and I rarely say this about perfumes - quite sexy. In terms of scent progression, it is relatively linear, which is not meant negatively here. Longevity and sillage are definitely good to very good for me, and the reactions from those around me are also noticeable - all in all, a great scent for anyone who is up for a bit of adventure in their fragrance wardrobe!"

Guilty Absolute pour Homme,05/01/2017,DonJuanDeCat,M,2046,,9,What on earth? Does it really say Gucci on it?,"What on earth? Does it really say Gucci on it?

So, I have to say that aside from my favorite Gucci fragrance, which is pour Homme II, I don't like any other Gucci men's fragrance, at least from those currently available. This doesn't apply to the fragrances released in the past, as I don't know them very well, but I've heard that they were quite good! Hard to believe when you look at the fragrances currently available from Gucci... anyway, I don't really like any of them, or at least they are rather insignificant.

And especially with the Guiltys, I had already given up all hope of getting something good under my nose... but a visit to a fragrance shop was supposed to change my mind...

Saleswoman: Good day, can I help you?
Me: Oh... I just wanted to see what's new!
Saleswoman: How about the new Gucci?
Me: Gucci? Is it Gucci pour Homme III???
Saleswoman: What? No, that doesn't even exist. I meant the new Guilty!
Me: .... Eww.... Guilty....
Saleswoman: Oh come on! Why don't you try it!
Me: ... if it really must be... I could try it on a test st...

Spruuuuuuuh.... Even before I could say ""test strip,"" I got a load sprayed right on my arm... internally, my eggs already hurt because I had already wasted a WHOLE arm... but...

Me: ... hmmm... Tell me, what's the name of the brand again?
Saleswoman: Gucci!
Me: Gucci??
Saleswoman: Gucci!
Me: Gucci Guilty?
Saleswoman: Gucci Guilty!!
Me: ... noooo... it must be something else...!
Saleswoman: ... why do so many people say that???

Yes, it's hard to believe, but what you smell here is actually not bad at all, and for a new Gucci fragrance, it has turned out surprisingly well! The scent structure itself is quite simple:

The scent:
Right at the beginning, you are immediately surrounded by a rather intense, but not unpleasant leather scent, which should please anyone who likes leather quite a bit. Together with the woody notes (I think I smell cypress here), the fragrance smells good and quite masculine. Moreover, this combination has the potential to be easily recognizable.
For a while, the scent remains like this, changing very little later on, except that a patchouli note comes in towards the base, making it a bit earthier. And I had the feeling that the leather becomes a bit softer. Vetiver was the note I couldn't smell at all.
A little later, you can really only smell the leather, which then doesn't smell softer anymore, but rather a bit rougher, which is not bad. As I said, it's not a bad scent, but it's really only suitable for leather fans. I don't like it that much, but in my opinion, this is the right direction for Gucci after all those really insignificant Guiltys...

The sillage and longevity:
The sillage is still quite strong at the beginning, but then it does fade a bit. Overall, the fragrance remains quite intense, so a larger scent cloud is left behind. This means the scent is well noticeable on someone, so you should be careful with the dosage.
The longevity is enormous. The fragrance can easily last more than fourteen or sixteen hours on the skin, if not more with the right dosage!

The bottle:
The bottle, however, remains not so special (well, that's a matter of taste), even if the logo is supposed to resemble the Batman logo :D
It looks like a fashionable flask (transparent) filled with brown fragrance liquid. Batman,... argh, I mean the logo is integrated into the glass, there is no label. The cap is cylindrical, black, and looks a bit too small. Not bad, but also not exceptionally beautiful.

So, as I said, this fragrance from Gucci has really turned out well, so well that I'm totally surprised that it says Gucci as a brand on it! It is still not my fragrance and will never be, but that's only because I don't like strong leather scents in general; however, many should like it quite a bit, provided they are really into leather. Moreover, this fragrance doesn't jump on the oud bandwagon. It may still smell a bit synthetic, but in a way that's not bothersome.

The scent is quite simple, as it only smells of leather and wood, it is quite masculine and could also be suitable for going out. It can be best worn in autumn and winter.

Hmm…
I know I shouldn't get my hopes up, but... I have a dream! To quote Martin Luther King Jr. :DD
.... I still dream of one day seeing a massive, rectangular bottle in a store with Gucci pour Homme III written on it, and neither leather nor coriander will be in it... one day... one... day...

And now that Gucci has once again released a somewhat good fragrance... one can still dream... *sigh* .... Or can’t one? We shall see... oh, I just hope so. Because leather is really not my thing, but everyone else can also ""waste"" an arm for the fragrance!"
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,08/15/2017,Fafner,M,7,,6,L'Homme Infini for Women,"Indeed, Guilty Absolute has a certain character. The amusing reference to Gucci's ""rediscovered eggs"" is not wrong.

Nevertheless, it does not reach the expressive power of the old Gucci heavyweights Gucci pour Homme (first version) and Envy pour Homme - which, however, had a different fragrance direction.

I would primarily classify it as immensely woody. Leather, vetiver traces, etc. as well. In any case, quite synthetic.

In the other comments, there is a ""guess what this reminds you of"" game, mentioning TdH, Carbonne, even Encre Noir. All associative and not completely wrong, but the hit is likely to be the following:

It reminds me - especially after the top note disappears - strikingly (!) of L'Homme Infini by Divine, which is, however, miles better and also significantly more expensive.

Could, despite its masculine note, also be interesting for women!"
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,12/25/2019,Benedikt2019,M,96,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,...Grandma's old leather bag in the bargain bin down the hall next to the front door...,"Actually, I hardly like any fragrances from Gucci; they are mostly very unbalanced, often too sweet disco-pumper scents (especially the newer ones!). They usually lack any charm or recognizable individuality. That’s what I thought about Gucci until I came across this one through a perfume review. It was touted as a fragrance that supposedly possesses niche quality and stands out in the leather scent segment due to its uniqueness. Those were big words, and since I do appreciate leather scents - just think of the incredible Ombre Leather by Tommy - I thought a blind buy couldn't hurt.

So I did it, Gucci arrived...(at a bargain price during the pre-Christmas shopping season!)

The bottle:
What can I say...miserable, cheap, the cap is hard to remove, the packaging looks like it’s from a drugstore. Overall, it’s a better flask that you’d rather place at the back of the fragrance shelf so that viewers don’t get startled or begin to doubt the collector's competence. Sorry for the harsh words, but the exterior seems to play a role in perfume :P

The test:
Wow! After the first spray, it was already more than clear that this is a leather scent. And what a scent it is, not a clean-cool biker like Tom Ford's, not an elegant rocker and seducer, no, this is a dirty, rugged guy. What you get under your nose is old, ancient leather that has been well-worn over the years. And for a long time, that’s all you smell. Leather, leather, and more leather. My mother aptly remarked: ""It smells like my mother's old green leather handbag that’s in our bargain bin!"" And I have to say: she’s right. It does have a slightly ""grandma-grandpa"" vibe, if you know what I mean? But it’s also exaggeratedly masculine at the same time. Consequently, it has a distinct uniqueness in the leather fragrance market that one must appreciate. This slight ""mustiness"" of the old leather does fade over time, and what remains is a beautiful, soft leather accord underlined by subtle (really very subtle!) woods. For me, it’s almost not a leathery-woody scent, but just a leather scent. It could also be a leather goods spray on the market or in a department store. Oh, and the good thing doesn’t change much.

Longevity and sillage:
Good! It’s a real powerhouse that projects for about 3-4 hours at a good arm's length before it pulls back. On the skin, it lasts a good 8 hours. So you get your money's worth.

Who wears something like this?
Well, you do, if you’re into real, dirty-old leather and want a leather scent that is truly authentic down to the last detail. It’s also for you if you enjoy fragrances that manage to awaken memories of days gone by. Think of scents like Timbuktu or the wonderful Burberry Touch. Moreover, it pairs perfectly with a leather jacket and wears excellently in autumn or winter. However, I find that it’s more of a scent for those over 30. Below that, it might come off wrong. Also, one must accept as a wearer that some may not perceive it as a scent at all because it’s so natural that, when paired with a leather jacket, it will likely lead to compliments about the nicely smelling jacket :D Overall, I would recommend testing this fragrance beforehand, as it is quite specific! After all, it’s available everywhere.

CONCLUSION: Gucci offers a premium leather scent with high niche quality in a dreadful guise!"

Guilty Absolute pour Homme,12/09/2023,Robi9501,M,10,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,The Scent for the Individualist,"Do you know that feeling? Fragrances that you would never buy just by smelling them in the store. But when someone close to you wears a scent and you get to know it through them, you start to learn to appreciate perfumes?

That's how it was for me with Guilty Absolute. My best friend always used this fragrance; I didn't know the perfume before. At some point, I bought the perfume for myself.

For me, Guilty Absolute was by no means a scent I liked right away. I had to learn to like it. This smoky, almost burnt-smelling perfume was not something I immediately enjoyed. But that will come.

Longevity and sillage are absolutely top-notch. It’s in the upper mid-range. The stuff lasts long on the skin, and you will be noticed for hours. But what exactly does it smell like?

Spiciness and bitter notes. Smokiness joins in, and I get a hint of burnt notes in my nose. Burnt, but not necessarily in a negative way. Rather, it’s striking. Unique.

And that is this scent. Unique. Not like any other fragrance. Not overly polished, not extremely complex. Simple, high-quality, and yet striking. A scent that definitely stays in your memory. But don’t we all want that? To emphasize our individuality? Guilty Absolute does this very well.

I have come to love this perfume, but in this review, I cannot avoid addressing the ingredients. BHT and some colorants that have a questionable reputation; there may well be allergenic and harmful substances present here. For the sake of completeness."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,12/19/2017,Taurus,M,1164,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Instead of Probation: Gucci Goes for “Bauhaus”,"And when I write “Bauhaus,” I don’t mean the great and groundbreaking art school from Weimar, but the DIY store chain from Mannheim.

In the early 70s, there was such a Bauhaus store near my parents' apartment, quite centrally located and occasionally a stop when I needed some crafting supplies for elementary school or similar. Two things have stuck in my memory like Pattex: on one hand, the subtle easy-listening light music that played on repeat there. On the other hand, the smell mix in the store of cut wooden planks and particle board, as well as wallpaper paint and industrial glue.

And somehow, that’s not so far removed from what Gucci wants to serve us with its latest Guilty version.
I actually thought, based on the initial positive feedback, that Gucci was on the verge of acquittal or at least on probation with this Guilty flanker. Alberto Morillas would have fit well as a probation officer, even if he occasionally made a few olfactory missteps.

Here, anyway, he has mixed up a hefty chemical cocktail that doesn’t even pretend to contain natural ingredients - that should at least be acknowledged. The artificial leather-wood blend is only pleasant for the first few seconds; after that, it quickly becomes annoying, especially since the whole thing takes on a strong resemblance to damp gray clay as modeling material. You can of course also purchase that at Bauhaus.
Patchouli and vetiver can only be found in theory; in the scent itself, you hardly perceive any of it ... as if someone had withheld it.

A bit more exciting than the conventional Guilty along with all its flankers is the Absolute pour Homme, but only because one tends to get more worked up about it.

I’m still not at peace with Gucci’s new releases, although I briefly thought that Coty had finally heard the call. If you like it, may it bring you bliss. For me, the entire Guilty series, including this offshoot, is a hopeless case of a virtually incorrigible repeat offender - despite deceptive camouflage."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,04/13/2017,KilianHN,M,6,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,While Cleaning Out the Horse Stable...,"He is a fierce leather scent, this fragrance. Massive leather, and almost nothing else. There is fine, soft leather and firm, durable leather. I suspect this scent belongs to the latter category due to its intensity. This type of leather comes with scars, cracks, creaks, and pops. However, this fragrance shows none of those characteristics. No natural surface marked by the roughness of nature is visible. Still, ""Guilty Absolute"" is the complete contrast to the usual Gucci waters.

I like leather, but whether it has to be in this intense, smoothed-out superficiality is debatable. Other leather fragrances come across much more distinctly. However, it could potentially be suitable for certain outings and bar visits. Or, indeed, for cleaning out the stable. For everything else, one should exercise caution. You could quickly be relegated to the ""stinky corner"" with subsequent recommendations for washing, showering, or bathing :))

For me, leather scent means dark, smoky, disreputable, daring, and a healthy, balanced portion of self-confidently selfish, even slightly arrogant, demanding stubbornness. This fragrance completely lacks all of that. It comes across, with consistent penetrance, as quite sterile. A clumsy, bumbling wannabe macho. There is no attraction emanating from it. Nuances, spirit, and charm are missing, which make a desirable macho."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,08/23/2018,Duftbär,M,5,,5,Maybe a Bit Too Much?,"Compared to this, Terre d'Hermes is almost a gentle breeze.
It should really just be called *Leather Extreme*! Caution is advised when it comes to dosing. Longevity for me was easily 15 hours. Top quality, but Mr. Morillas unfortunately
leaves little room for anything other than the leather perception. Other notes are hardly recognizable.
Some women (or men) will surely love it, but for others it might be a bit overwhelming.
Nevertheless, a completely independent, high-quality fragrance."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,03/08/2020,Leko,M,20,,6,"Take a good whiff of this one, my friend","Guilty Absolute pour Homme is certainly not among the fabric softeners or pale scents. Leather is truly special and richly present, but very well embedded in a pleasantly cheeky spiciness, wood, smoke, and a light oriental sweetness. In this case, the sweet touch does not ruin anything (I’m not a fan of sweetness), but rather rounds it off and enhances the sillage. This combination thus appears animalistic and seductive, possessing a certain dominance. If GA weren't a bit sweet, it would probably be quite intense and borderline. Comparable in effect to N°. XXII - Black Afghan.

If I were an animal, I would probably have marked my territory with this and staked my claim. The sillage is powerful and signals to other males that an alpha male is on the way. In the realm of humans, this creation might also rub some people the wrong way, or one might just fall in love with it. With a smirk, I’ll lean out the window and claim that one submits to it. Well, those are just my feelings and associations.

By the way, I could also occasionally imagine this scent on an alpha female, but I would not issue it the label ""unisex"" at all. Statements like ""grandma's old leather bag,"" ""50s handbag,"" or ""plaster leather"" fit well and resonate clearly. A unique feature in the leather domain and an animalistic dominance would be my summary of an exotic men's fragrance."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,03/10/2025,DukeOfEarl,M,26,,10,Wild Leather,"This scent smells of adventure, of dusty stables, fine saddle leather, and the hint of wildness that lingers in the air when you ride out at dawn.

From the very first moment, this fragrance reminds you of the rich, dark smell of a freshly oiled saddle, whose leather only becomes more beautiful over the years. It is not a soft, sweet leather, but a powerful, almost rugged aroma - as if you were rubbing saddle care products between your fingers while the warm skin of the horse still radiates the heat of a long ride.

You lean against a pasture fence and let your gaze glide over the wide fields and hills, while your horse snorts beside you.

This scent is as timeless as cowboys in their flannel shirts, worn with ease but with a presence that immediately stands out. It speaks of confidence, of people who don’t need to be loud to make an impression.

We have strong, beautiful leather that lasts for hours, and when the fragrance settles, a hint of vetiver and warm woods remains.
Just this.

A feeling of coming home after a long ride and letting the day wind down in an armchair with a glass of whisky."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,04/12/2017,AndreasK,M,43,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Clear Leather,"I smell only and exclusively leather. I cannot perceive any other components.

At first, I have the impression of a clear, fresh leather. The scent feels almost transparent, see-through. In Dior Fahrenheit, the leather is embedded in a bouquet of accompanying notes. Gucci Guilty is a fragrance experience that is straightforward and minimalist, direct, and unembellished. Therefore, I consider it more suitable for the bright season, although not exactly for the hottest summer days.

However, after three to four hours, a vinegar-like sour note creeps in. In this respect, I can partially understand the dismissive comments of my predecessors.

Sillage is average, longevity is good.

Leather lovers can certainly consider Gucci Guilty as a serious option without having to feel ""guilty"" about a misstep. I generally don't like leather scents that much. However, that must be set aside here. All in all, I would say it's a decent scent, but not one that causes enthusiasm.

Guilty is most likely wearable in casual settings. It evokes associations of jeans, motorcycles, and of course, leather jackets."

No. From the absolute will to protect his people and family. Tempered and driven. Strong, but not immortal. The fight is his life. But only when he must. Then he has ""Killing in the Name of"" by RATM in his blood.

To sit by the fire on summer evenings with his loved ones. With his little ones in his arms. Completely calm. Like ""Nothing else matters"" by Metallica. That is his life too. Warm, heartfelt, loving, bear-like.

Not everyone likes him, but everyone respects him. Not everyone can handle alpha males who know the way, who show a clear edge (and can hurt because of it), clearly. Some are frightened. He is not a smiling guy that everyone likes.

At that time it was new, and I had no idea what kind of fragrance it was at all.
I opened the packaging and saw Gucci Guilty Absolute, thinking to myself,
what has Gucci done this time, a version of the boring Guilty in brown?
I opened the bottle and sprayed it on my arm and asked my girlfriend what she thought of it?
Her reaction was iiiiiiiii it smells like an old leather sofa,
my thought was, it must smell amazing..
Next, it was my turn to smell..
I sniffed and suddenly had a vivid imagination, an unkempt guy (with good taste) with a three-day beard,
a smoking cigarette at the corner of his mouth, dressed in black leather, and riding a Harley, it all just fits this scent.
Later, the woods also come through, and it becomes a mild leather scent.
This fragrance is not for the faint-hearted.
You have to be the right person for this scent,
so that you wear the fragrance and not the other way around!
Mass appeal is another matter.
It certainly won't appeal to many people who are into mainstream fragrances.

If you want to smell pure leather, you are in the right place. However, that’s about all there is to it. As the name suggests, the scent is Absolute. But if you are looking for a complex interplay of various notes, you are definitely in the wrong place. Little experimentation, but plenty of cojones.

Unfortunately, the perfume lacks a bit of juice and 'grime' to make it feel more three-dimensional and natural...

Since Gucci has moved to Coty/ P&G, many beloved fragrances have been removed from the lineup or significantly reduced + reformulated, and what has been newly released for both women and men is a complete disaster.

Im also getting a sweet cherry fruity feel which I love. Reminds me of bandages in a good way as I also get the medicinal and gasoline vibes as well. Great performance and a gem that I would recommend just for its simplicity but great scent."

Guilty Absolute pour Homme,05/23/2021,Leprince069,M,16,,2,The Adventurer with a Broken Motorcycle and Oil on His Fingers,"Surprisingly masculine and leathery for a Gucci Guilty variation. More of an outdoor scent that radiates movement, a thirst for adventure, and masculinity. This fragrance is definitely leathery and also ""dirty."" At this point, one does not imagine a freshly showered delicate gentleman ready to throw on his suit. Rather, it evokes the image of a worker, a mechanic, the bearded guy who is about to roar through the mud on his Café Racer. More like the man who, in a white undershirt, is about to dump the next load of gravel onto the trailer. The longevity is quite good, the projection as well. For the now fairly affordable price, it's not a bad choice at all, as long as you know what to expect. I would recommend it more for ages 30 and up."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,08/01/2025,Gregor87,M,4,,4,Auto Workshop in the Desert,"Where do I start :) I first smelled Gucci Absolute in 2017 when it was released, and I still remember it clearly.

The first thing I smelled back then was dry, very dry leather. I found it incredible, but I didn't know how, when, and where I should wear it.

I often caught myself smelling it again and again on a yearly basis, and the fragrance kept changing for me.

About half a year ago, I bought it, and what can I say? It will definitely remain a staple in my collection.

This leather has a dry yet slightly zesty sweetness. A faint undertone of oil occasionally comes through, and I don't want to miss this scent.

It is generally ranked for autumn and winter here, but I think it works anytime as long as you don't overdo it. I really enjoy wearing it in summer, and it works great in the evenings too.

In my opinion, it's a must for every leather fragrance fan."
Guilty Absolute pour Homme,11/06/2020,Maksime,M,7,,4,Pure Leather.,"Men's wearable leather perfume. At first, it's loud leather, but that fades quickly. Next, a blend of wood accord with herbs takes over, and you start to fall in love with the fragrance. I have the feeling that there are citrus notes in it, even though it's not mentioned in the pyramid."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,06/13/2024,Whimssysteph,F,13,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,why wasn't this more popular?!,"If this hadn't come out right before the pandemic, I think it would've been way more popular. It would've drawn in the clean girl crowd, the unisex scent crowd, and of course the Harry Stiles fans, among others. It has a nice balance of clean and herbal without smelling like hand soap or cleaning products, and it is very soothing. The bottle is gorgeous and sleek, and unlike most of what is being churned out by mainstream brands at the moment. It plays nicely with other scents to layer, and you can amp up the floral-ness or even add a bit of fruitness if you so desire. I feel like this was barely a blip on the radar, which is a shame, because it is really good. It is a little more powerful than other skin scents, but it doesn't dominate when worn either. I call it a skin-plus scent, because it is there and it is lovely, but it doesn't draw attention like a magnet. Rather, it is subtly charismatic. I do think it is truly unisex as well, as the chamomile doesn't give ""flower,"" it gives ""outside in the early morning sunlight."""
Mémoire d'une Odeur,04/16/2021,Elysium,M,898,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,A Sort Of Amulet Against Evil,"Gucci Mémoire d'une Odeur has always fascinated me ever since they first released it. That hay and sweet herb-like nuance immediately caught my attention, the intense and familiar aroma of chamomile, bitter honey, and green apple. Chamomile, a small daisy-like flower, does not smell but more than one because different varieties offer different shades to a perfumer. The wild one, for example, is herbaceous, green, and fresh, more reminiscent of the herbal tea we drink to calm us down or invite us to sleep. The German one, on the other hand, is sweeter but smoky, with hints of apple. Finally, Roman chamomile or Anthemis nobilis is sweet, delicately spiced, and intoxicating, with an apple blossom flavor. The latter was chosen as the top note for Mémoire d'une Odeur. So, close your eyes for a moment and imagine you are lying on a lawn. Next to you is an old wicker basket where you have placed a few handfuls of chamomile flowers. They look like a polka dot extravaganza, and the sun-intensified scent is unexpectedly lush. All this is Gucci's perfume, even if it's not the first with chamomile flowers, there are masterpieces like Youth-Dew by Estée Lauder, Gucci by Gucci, or my beloved Clinique's Aromatics Elixir, and so on. it'sIt's the way that wildflower blends with the other ingredients that makes this scent original and intriguing.

The perfume belongs to a new mineral and aromatic family and opens with an explosion of watery notes, where for a moment, the partnership with Kenzo Pour Homme is inevitable. I feel the same vibes in it, that underlying aroma so characteristic of the blue bottle in the shape of a bamboo cane, and I honestly can't tell which note or blend reproduces that beautiful watery accord. After a few minutes, I get a bitter almond-like puff, just a glance, followed by a herbaceous facet coming to life. I perceive the aroma of chamomile petals with light shades of petroleum and leather aspects, the same smell that comes out of a teabag when pressed between the fingers. There is no doubt that this flower so rarely used in perfumery makes itself felt, and I love it. From the very first notes, Mémoire d'une Odeur is not an intense, opaque, heavy perfume. Instead, it is just like the chamomile flower, relaxing, soothing, graceful, fresh. The initial aroma fades into the foreground but never completely disappears from the composition.

Slowly the opening retracts to make room for a floral heart. Jasmine, present here in a particular species known as Indian Coral, announces itself with nuances reminiscent of acacia honey and something that comes from orange, flowers probably but also a touch of sweet zest. The honey note is delicious, with a pleasant bitterness, and the orange remains relatively shy. As for jasmine, it can quickly smother a perfume due to its volume, but it is worked with a lot of subtlety here. You will easily guess its presence, sure, but it never goes so far as to steal its sovereignty with chamomile. It's a fancy heart, not sweet or overbearing. However, it also has delightful flaps of talc, still supported by the accord of water and a prominent dose of mineral musk that brings a familiar warmth and connects all the other olfactory elements with pure softness.

The woody trail features notes of dry cedar and creamy sandalwood. Vanilla enhances the creaminess of the latter. However, it does not stand out on my skin nor takes a gourmand vibe. The woodiness comes to calm the greedy side of the trio: honey, orange, vanilla. At this point, the scent no longer changes and is all one with the skin. The whole elixir is so well blended that none of the notes goes out of the chors.

I can't help but think that Mémoire d'une Odeur is a contemporary version of those aquatic aromas that defined perfume in the 90s, Kenzo Pour Homme, as already mentioned. I like most about this perfume because its unique blend of notes smell unlike any fragrance I've experienced; there is no Ambroxan, Iso-E Super, or trendy note in here. An excellent perfume for spring and summer, beautiful in the morning as soon as you wake up, you can wear it every day, in the office and on a date, with your most casual attire and when you are dressed to impress, but also if you go out to do a walk or jog. As for performance, well, both sillage and longevity are minor than moderate on my skin, settling close to the skin after nearly an hour. Strictly speaking, I did not expect that from an EDP concentration, the trail would remain discrete. We are talking about an intimate fragrance rather than a juice that will turn heads as you pass. Overall I like it, and a lot.

I based this review on a 100ml bottle I have owned since April 2021.

Mémoire d'une Odeur,12/03/2020,Kurai,M,388,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Happy chamomile and jasmin,"Now this fragrance is unique, not a crowd pleaser. People will either love or hate it. Personally, I like how Gucci is positioning itself in the designer perfume market with relatively non-mainstream fragrances.

The first spray is a herbal tea slap in the face. Then a floral chamomile comes through, which is truely pleasant. I get instant flashbacks to the happier days of summer vacation; sunny, innocent and nothing but positivity. After a while the freshness makes place for a heavier floral with a serious retro vibe. In the end I get a lovely drydown; soapy florals with jasmin.

I liked that i tried it out. It's fascinating, completely different from any scent I have ever bought or tried before. I finished my 2ml sample, so now I'm at the point to ask myself ""Do I want to continue wearing it?"" Well.. Yeah I do! And that stylish bottle is also a great plus. So, most likely when I run into a good deal, I'll end up buying it."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,02/13/2022,Guccy2021,F,7,,4,"Fresh Swamp, in a good way","Aesthetic: late 19th/early 20th century impressionism paintings of garden ponds with lily pads. This is a murky yet green scent, almost aquatic to me, but not quite. I attribute that to the chamomile. The murk is probably from musk. I've only ever lived on the coastal Atlantic of the US so I think of swamps when I smell ""wet + green."" Minus the salt, which would make this STINK but it does not. It's subtle. There is no ocean invoked in this, the water is strictly fresh."

I love aromatics and herbal scents, and this one doesn't disappoint. But once the herbal notes fly away i'm let with nothing. I knew this juice was fleeting, but yeah i confirm it.
This is a personnal scent, except your lover, or someone who hugs you, no one will perceive it in my opinion. However this is a good evening/bed scent.
Conclusion : good experience, I don't regret the blindbuy, i wanted to try it."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,09/06/2022,Mlleghoul,F,458,,4,A melancholy elegy for the whimsy of childhood,"Herbal, dusty bittersweet, dreamlike and shivery green musk. The sorrows of strange lullabies lilted in gentle whispers, fairytales of snow-blooming trees, borne from bones. A fragile, longing, shimmering bell. A fleeting dew, a pale mist drifting low in a meadow, vanishing into an empty sky. A melancholy elegy for the whimsy of childhood. A deathbed poem at dawn."

Mémoire d'une Odeur,08/12/2025,Chrissysmell,F,36,,1,"Sour, Sweet, Gone","The initial spray is sour, floral, and powdery. It's strong for a total of two minutes and then fades into nothing. If you sniff really hard, the chamomile note calms down from sour to mildly honeyed. This fragrance is overall clean and powdery. It's nothing special. I don't like how it smells initially, but a bad fragrance is more exciting than a nonexistent drydown."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,02/26/2025,grotesqueque,M,25,,1,Weird and medicinal,"Opens up with a medicinal chamomile smell, not tea, more of like a cabinet with medicine and that pack of loose-leaf chamomile tea you drink only when you are sick, cause you really don't drink tea that much.

Mémoire d'une Odeur,11/25/2023,Musicandarts,M,227,,1,Too weak to be called an EDP,"I find this EDP too weak to be called a perfume. Poor sillage, projection and longevity. I could douse myself with this so called EDP before bed, to find very little of it on my body or my clothes next morning.

The top notes (chamomile and bitter almond) open a bit too synthetic for my taste. The overall scent is OK after the top notes have dissipated. It was a blind buy, seduced by the Gucci brand name. I would happily give it away if some friend or family member takes a shine for it."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,07/25/2025,midaramadara,F,50,,1,"yeah, no. but also yes","this is definitely not what chamomile smells like, so if you're looking for a photorealistic smell of the flower or the tea, you won't find it here.
nonetheless, it's a pretty fragrance - clean, fresh, comforting and soft. like white linen handwashed in simple soap and rinsed in cold water with herbal essential oils. a little sweetness in the background, a touch of sandalwood to round down all the sharp aromatic edges. +50 to calming aura
definitely a skin-scent, doesn't radiate, but catching wafts of it during the day is pleasant."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,09/23/2025,saliagesiren,N/A,7,,1,there and gone,"Oh, Gucci Memoire, my beloved. The longevity is as fleeting and light as the scent itself (at least on me - I've never been able to keep florals on my skin). Very little projection, so it's a nice every day perfume. Reminds me of something a fairy would wear, or a foggy spring morning. Soft floral/herbal without being too sweet or girly. It's mature but not in an old-lady way. I love the scent, just wish it lasted longer."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,08/03/2019,Zauber600,M,49,,0,Controversies in the Summer Lull,"Mémoire d'une Odeur seems to be perceived very differently when looking at today's statements.

Contra: There are mentions of glue with 3 letters that should go back in the tube, burnt plastic, moldy wood... and then treated with wood varnish.

Pro: beautiful bottle, romance, nostalgia, sensuality, chamomile-veneer-woody, very light and different.
This is also reflected in the ratings from 0 - 10.0... everything is included. I haven't experienced anything like this here for a long time.

Recently, the perfumer of this fragrance - Alberto Morillas - has often received poor ratings for his scents as soon as his name came up.

However, if you take the effort to look at his oeuvre

- 371 fragrances with an average rating of 7.3 for renowned brands like Armani, Bulgari, Carolina Herrera, YSL, and many others -

you'll find that some very well-known and successful fragrances were developed by him (sometimes in collaboration with others). Most are mainstreamers that need to generate profit through sales in the mass market. As is generally known, these come with a fixed cost framework for fragrance, bottle, packaging, and especially for marketing. It’s safer to stay on the commercially secure side, and often there’s a lack of courage for extraordinary fragrances.

And as MitParfumo Stulle aptly noted on this topic: Mr. M. is just an artist who also likes to make money - that’s not dishonorable (even artists like to eat warm!).

However, he also has some exciting fragrances, especially where he was surely given some freedom. I think of Kilian, the expensive Bulgari series, Chopard, and also my favorite from him, Opus VII/Amouage.

The latest Gucci Guilty releases for men by Alberto Morillas have softened my previously rather negative opinion. I find them bold and also successful, particularly Gucci Guilty Absolute and Gucci Guilty Cologne pour Homme.
The new fragrance - Mémoire d'une Odeur - is also part of this. Accompanied by a promotional film featuring a lot of strange people jumping around a beautifully stunning castle, making fires, and doing other odd things... the message is, of course, hard to grasp: In my opinion, it’s about an 80s/90s revival fragrance, and the first test immediately reminded me of 'Bitter Sweet Symphony' by The Verve

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lyu1KKwC74

or the film Call Me By Your Name - Elio

This fragrance also somehow has something very life-like and vibrant about it: sad and happy, soft and hard, bitter and sweet.

The pyramid provided here seems incomplete to my nose. Mémoire d'une Odeur starts with a herb-bitter chamomile note that is quickly underlaid by honey-toned coral jasmine flowers (mourning tree), and there’s probably a bit of lavender in there too. Its lightness and clarity come from the generous use of slightly soapy musk, while the base consists of creamy sandalwood and fresh cedar wood, with an almost unsweet vanilla providing the counterpoint.

Mémoire d'une Odeur lies somewhere between Comme des Garçons Parfum, Гоша Рубчинский Gosha Rubchinskiy, and Fougère Royale Houbigant (2010)... this as a rough guideline. The fragrance is very idiosyncratic, and I can't quite put it into the right words. But I think some of the male Parfumos should know these fragrances; for the ladies, if they are not familiar with the scents, a heroic self-test is the only option since I don't (well) know (comparable) women's fragrances. Sorry!

For me, the composition of Mémoire d'une Odeur - like that of the two other mentioned Gucci fragrances - is a bold step away from the usual mainstream monotony despite the surely stringent guidelines here as well.

Longevity and sillage: 5 - 6 hours and medium
Edit: Corrected downwards, the fragrance had better H/S from the tester than from my bottle (2 test runs)

Genre: Like 'Comme des Garçons' Odeurs (play on words!)

For whom: Men and women who enjoy unusual fragrances

When: Actually always - but from 25° upwards it becomes smoother, and the longevity and sillage improve significantly!

Alternatives: None available ;-)

Mémoire d'une Odeur,08/06/2021,AlterHerr,M,10,,75,The Autumn Crocus,"A strange summer is passing by. The pandemic and climate change have made traveling an increasingly ambivalent experience, with the ever-raised finger of grandchildren urging restraint. And damn it - they are right.

My biographical CO2 footprint is embarrassing.

Then came the water. Yes, I live in a flood zone, and I could hardly have emptied the flooded basement on my own. Thanks to the young helpers.

I cannot move on to everyday life, even though I have personally come through relatively unscathed. Relatives, friends, neighbors, and acquaintances are often more severely affected. Some who were privileged just yesterday now live in a friend's guest room. At over 70, the thought of a fresh start is not easy. And yet many - including my generation - feel the need for a break.

The car was washed away, so I won't be getting a new one at all.
I never intended to end up as one of those retirees who mistakenly think they can turn the local marketplace into a drive-in while in reverse gear.

And only in the moment of destruction do I realize that I have been blind for too long to the lush beauty of my homeland. What wonderful corners and treasures are there here?
Memories of wonderful and memorable moments of my life...

Now, this is not a seniors' forum, but a perfume forum, and the present Gucci fragrance is aptly not called Memory of the Prom, but Mémoire d'une Odeur.
It is no less capable.

It reminds me of how, as a little rascal in short pants, I roamed the woods of my homeland with my friends. Always in search of adventures or materials for dam building. The wet leaves, the soft ground, rain, moss, a snail, a earthworm, a brook gently winding down a slope, sunbeams peeking through the trees, the rust on an old metal barrel - even the inorganic felt organic in such an environment.

The nettles stung, because that is the job of a nettle, the sweater itched, and a splinter occasionally found its way into a finger. And I was bursting with life that surrounded me.
I smell more here than just a dull bagged tea; rather, I perceive the chamomiles as wildflowers at the edge of the field, along with the earth surrounding them.

This Eau de Parfum is the antithesis to the Instagram age. Not loud, colorful, and flashy.
Instead, it is herbaceous yet familiar. No synthetic gourmand trying to please everyone with sticky sweetness. And that is precisely what makes it so authentic.
Its fragrance notes represent the nuances and facets of life far more accurately than those terrible cinnamon pudding bombs. Honestly, I would hardly have expected such an anti-mainstream statement from Gucci.

By the way, Mémoire d'une Odeur features, at least for me personally, the most aesthetically pleasing bottle in my collection. A fragrance can hardly be dressed more elegantly.
I can hardly wait for the start of autumn. I want to slip into my shoes and jump in puddles. I want to hear the dirt splattered on my pants. I want to bend down and admire an ant at its diligent work for minutes on end.

All the good was so close all along.
Thank you, Señor Morillas, for reminding me of that..."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,12/08/2019,Sniffsniff,F,23,,40,Of Disturbance and Irrational Desire ...,"On October 3rd, I boarded a truck ferry heading to the Baltic Sea to relax for a few days on the Curonian Spit. To reach the passenger deck of the massive ship, foot passengers were guided immediately after boarding through a narrow corridor that seamlessly transitioned into an apparently endless escalator. Up we went, and a slight unease set in. A few bars of ""Stairway to Heaven"" came to mind. Suddenly, there it was, a poster. Alone in the wide expanse. Beautiful people in soft light. Bohemia, I hear you rustling! A sign, fate, divine providence! A new Gucci fragrance - and the escalator leads me straight into the heavenly realm of the onboard shop. (It should be noted that my collection at the beginning of October still consisted of Gucci Rush and Gucci Rush - my scent since 1999.) So I quickly checked in, had a cozy beer for my husband's sake, and disappeared into the (12 square meter) onboard shop. Chic bottle. Fits those beautiful people who seem to have something Bacchanalian on their minds in the soft backlight. My insides are already reveling in seductive, soft scent spheres. I spray on the paper. Full of anticipation, I inhale the fragrance. Peuhaoioioi! I am outraged. I almost topple over backwards. What on earth is this, what is it supposed to be, and who the hell wants to smell like this? Alcohol on foot tincture with straw and moss under decayed birch. I expected a perfume that should smell like what my average nose knows and can categorize. This is definitely not ""Memoire d'une odeur."" I was somehow disturbed and trudged back disappointed to my husband, who secretly rejoiced at having saved a lot of money.
A month later, I am at the turquoise shop and get to choose a birthday fragrance. The saleswoman is wonderful. She scans me, knows me. The first fragrance presented is mine and is purchased. However, I am a bit disappointed as I would have liked to try more. ""Oh, that reminds me of an experience with the new Gucci, I would like to test that one again."" The wonderful one confidently reaches for ""Ambrosia di fiori"" and holds the paper under my nose. ""No, this one isn't for me either, but I mean the green one, the intense one."" ""The green one, seriously the green one?"" The turquoise lady is noticeably shaken. ""Yes, I want to give it another chance. Maybe it will develop and become beautiful."" ""No, nothing will become beautiful anymore!"" Have I mentioned how incredibly likable this saleswoman was? Nothing beats disarming honesty. So we both don't find the fragrance that great.
Third attempt, end of November. There it is again. The green anti-floral water is smiling at me, I reach for it and become daring. I spray the fragrance on my wrist. It is no longer as harsh as during our first encounter on the stormy Baltic Sea. Once the alcohol veil has faded, it takes on a sober note. It is clear. It has nothing playful about it. It doesn't want to be erotic, not feminine, not wicked. I like the chamomile, which calms me. It has something strict about it, it sets the direction while remaining clear and noble. The woods come in, giving the chamomile fullness. I perceive the musk only minimally. At the very end, I can sense the vanilla, very delicately, now only in connection with the chamomile, which is now just a fine veil.
Early December: What’s the point of being stingy? I bought the bottle. What has moved me for so long and repeatedly is meant to belong to me. I also have an explanation: Since our first encounter, I have sniffed through the entire turquoise standard range and realized that I find flowers terribly off-putting. Especially lily of the valley. Fruits are somewhat better. I have also understood that my fragrances must be at least unisex. I find many men's fragrances more wearable on me than, for example, a SI or LVEB. That a pure women's fragrance can trigger a buying impulse in me is extremely rare. I am now happy when a fragrance smells different, when it can stand out from the fruity-floral pleasantries.
And ""Memoire d'une odeur"" can do that all too well. It is not a girl’s fragrance. At least not for those who want to be sweet and sexy, rush to the nail salon, and stick on fake lashes.
It reminds me with its slight hay note of my horses and already evokes a sense of well-being in me for that reason alone. I spray it on my pillow before sleeping and sleep deeply and soundly. It is so light and clear that I would even wear it in the stable. I would never even think of doing that with another fragrance. And I believe my horses would like it too.
Tomorrow I will wear it to school, and I am curious to see what it will evoke there. It remains a polarizing fragrance, but it is worth giving it 7-364 chances. All fragrance conventions on ""reset,"" and ""Memoire"" has the potential to create a new scent memory."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,09/06/2019,TruuMax,M,75,,22,Laughter in the Perfumery,"A few days ago, I entered the local beauty store because I saw this fragrance in the window...

The young saleswoman was already grinning at me, certain that I wouldn't like it...

My first reaction, ""Wow, this is different... I'LL TAKE IT,"" caused uproarious laughter. You couldn't say it better.

The scent reminds me of the chamomile version of A Song for the Rose. Strong, herbal, floral, and somewhat woody.

The progression goes from aggressively herbal to beautifully tea-like towards the end.

Truly a very unique designer...

The longevity is good, but likely very variable depending on skin and weather.

Sillage is good, but not overwhelming. Very airy yet still dominant.

I already love it."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,09/16/2019,Hasiputz80,F,34,,0,...of Hay and Herbs and Nervous Children.....,"I am actually quite lazy when it comes to writing and prefer to give a short statement about a fragrance. But Memoire d‘une odeur is so wonderfully different. Just the name suggests something good.
For me, the Roman Chamomile is definitely dominant in this fragrance. It should not be confused with the scent of chamomile tea, as some have indicated here. Anyone who knows the pure essential oil of Roman Chamomile knows that chamomile tea smells completely different.
In aromatherapy, Roman Chamomile is primarily used for restless toddlers. It has a harmonizing effect on body and mind.
With the oil of Roman Chamomile, it was love at first sniff for me. I liked it from the very first try.
I often used it in the fragrance lamp for my children.

I took the test strip of Memoire d‘une Odeur home and held it under my children's noses. The test result was very positive. My son said: it smells good, like hay and herbs. Whether the judgment was so favorable because they have been exposed to the scent from a young age is hard to say....
But there really isn't much more to say about it. I feel the same way.
Green, herbal with a hint of woody powder in the base. With recognizability without being vintage-heavy in any way.

Definitely not for gourmand lovers, but certainly unisex."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,09/14/2019,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,29,The Transformation,"Today I finally discovered Memoire, the new Gucci, which I had been eagerly awaiting.

However, the opening is somewhat sour, and I disappointedly set the beautiful bottle aside.

I'd rather go for the ""floating"" crane from Berdoues, which I've also had on my radar for a long time.

But already in the car, a calm yet full aroma surrounds me, emanating from my wrist.
Memoire pleasantly reminds me of itself.

This transformation is not Kafkaesque, but very accommodating.

The chamomile brings tranquility and nestles against the soft woods.
A cozy feeling arises - emphasized by the warm vanilla.

This scent reminds me of sociable yet quiet evenings in the hunting lodge, where we casually chatted over a cup of tea, and the branches of the trees gently tapped against the windows.
The stove crackled comfortably, and nature surrounded us - so close you could reach out and touch it.

Yes, that is the ""Odeur"" that Memoire gently reminds me of."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,12/27/2019,Roveena,F,123,,26,Zooming Past the Mainstream at 180 km/h,"How do you incorporate chamomile, hay, and herbs into a fragrance that is still pleasing? Gucci has managed it - although the scent almost defeated me at first. I couldn't really make anything of it. I didn't find it bad, but somehow it was also not a fragrance experience, neither in a positive nor in a negative sense. At least there was nothing that repelled me, unlike some other testers here. At first sniff, I imagined I smelled a strange rubber note that I associate with myrrh (are you sure there's none in there?!) and that wasn't a turn-on, but it did make me curious. So I wore it for a day and that was... okay. Nothing more.

The next test went completely differently - the scent is simply beautiful. Just beautiful. Fresh, clean, calming, unusual, and with a high recognition value while still being pleasing. Yes, ""pleasing"" is a nasty word. No one wants to smell ""pleasing,"" I just mean: This fragrance, despite its very specific aura, doesn't hurt anyone and delights all those who appreciate it. I've found that among the people who actively test it, opinions are usually very divided, but among those who perceive the scent on others - for example, on me - the unanimous opinion is that Memoire d’une Odeur is very pleasant and far from being generic. What more could you want? For me, this is a perfume that is better not ""tested,"" but simply worn, without expecting anything (you know how some perfumes fail when you ""sniff closely,"" but are great when they waft into your nose by chance?).

For me, Memoire d’une Odeur is a successful blend of retro and modern, of a scent that doesn't want to be one and a perfume that has everything that makes a truly good perfume. Although it is completely clear: This scent cannot please anyone who isn't fond of chamomile. The most beautiful woods and the finest musk cannot overshadow that, and even the vanilla won't save it (by the way: chamomile and vanilla? I never thought that would work!).

What else is there to say? In my opinion, this is not a unisex scent, but suits the ladies better (really, Harry Styles as a face for this?!). The sillage is not overwhelming, but noticeable, and the longevity is good, though not outstanding. A ""hippie scent,"" as the advertising wants us to believe? Nope, but similarly free-spirited, quirky, and connected to nature."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,05/05/2021,Dexter82,M,105,,32,From Bah to Whoaa!,"A warm embrace from the past. That's how I would describe it best. Growing up in a village with horse domes and wildflower meadows, I can somewhat relate to the advertising and the name...
But one thing at a time. The fragrance was released in 2019, and I wanted to test it immediately. The bottle is beautifully vintage, and the name sounded promising. I went to the perfume store. Sprayed it on my wrist and ""Bah!"". Here I can agree with my predecessors that the initial impression smells rather medicinal. As often happens, we simply don't give things the time to develop when the first impression is already bad. Chamomile is also very special and unusual in the mainstream fragrance segment. You also associate chamomile more with childhood, when you were sick and had to choke down the tea...
Two years later, during the pandemic, I moved back from the big city to my roots, went for a walk, and once again noticed the herbal scents that I loved as a child. Memories came flooding back, and as luck would have it, I saw Gucci Memoire d'une Odeur at Müller and tested it again. Love, sentimentality, and memories. I think the current mental state and circumstances play a role in how one initially perceives a fragrance. Today, I discover the depth of the scent. Somehow it makes sense today.
The composition starts with spicy-floral chamomile. Warm, vibrant. Minutes later, woody notes weave in. Sandalwood, and later a cedar note. The chamomile is a throbbing heart from top to base. Wrapped in fine woods, until in the end, the warm vanilla transforms the chamomile into a skin-friendly scent.
It smells to me like the bottle looks - vintage. It is unisex without a doubt, but I see people in their mid-20s and older wearing this fragrance. It seems mature, unpretentious, thoughtful, and personal. Personal in the sense of: I am completely myself and don't want to be in the spotlight. People notice me, respect me, but everyone realizes that my presence is enough without many words.
The sillage is moderate (spring 12-20°C). At work, I was sniffed out. Opinions are divided, but no one found it unpleasant.
This fragrance is worn for oneself and not for others. I find it subtle and somehow comforting in the time of the pandemic, where we often live in isolation...
I am a big fan of the sprayer, and this one gives a great and even mist!
In summary: Give this fragrance a chance. Try it out from time to time, preferably in different seasons.
I got a good deal on Notino, check it out.
Best regards."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,04/11/2021,UntermWert,F,58,,29,Old Photo Album,"Mémoire d’une Odeur is like flipping through an old photo album.
Images of a Sunday walk in a spa park or castle garden - it smells herb-floral, very fresh. The flowers are planted and cared for with great precision, a beautiful weeping willow by a pond. Everyone is wearing their ""good"" Sunday clothes, the little girl with knee socks... an ice cream cone in her hand. She stands in a trellis and daydreams. The Sunday dress is a bit uncomfortable. Older ladies are feeding ducks.

Then comes chamomile tea in kindergarten. Comforting, protective, a break.
And an old pharmacy after a visit to the pediatrician. The light gently refracts in the old glass bottles on the shelves, their wooden scent forming a sweet-warm contrast to the medicinal. Trust.

The herbaceous opening of Mémoire d’une Odeur surprises me greatly... it scratches... and is at the same time as retro as those faded photos from the zeitgeist books of my hometown... Like a Super-8 film from childhood... that’s how it smells... The theme is extremely well captured... it awakens many memories, still images, film sequences. At some point, the chamomile comes - but not sweet, rather ""pharmaceutical""...
The impression of a Polaroid-distorted 70s atmosphere pushes itself forward and sends images. Overexposed. But beautiful.

In between, I also get the association that this is how a ""good"" bar of soap might smell in the modest quarters of a servant in Downton Abbey. Not opulent, rather modest. Actually, such a soap doesn’t quite fit me - but it smells so cozy-arrived. Maybe for the laundry drawer?
-------------------------------
Mémoire d‘une Odeur is truly a scent far removed from the ""mainstream."" At least, when one associates terms like ""crowd-pleasing"" or ""performance"" with perfumes. In fact, it is much more complex than the fragrance description suggests. The herbaceous opening seems to emanate from the weeping willow - very fresh, floral-herbaceous and initially very unsweet. The chamomile reveals itself to me only later, but when it does, it is very clear, albeit gently and thoughtfully. One should therefore be fundamentally fond of this note. I found this phase in the scent's progression to be very pleasant, calming, almost comforting. With the woods, the scent then becomes very intimate and a ""memory of a scent."" I join the other reviews that describe the fragrance as quiet yet profound.
It can be suitable for everyday wear - perhaps as a comforter in these stressful times - but I believe it would distract me due to the memories it evokes... clearly it is also unisex, but in my opinion, it leans more towards the feminine.
I just looked at the photos from the advertising campaign because I didn’t know who Harry Styles is, and I was quite surprised. Dancing with cheerful, flawless millennials in ""boho"" style in front of a castle ruin, I would not have associated the scent with that at all...
I find the bottle very fitting, nostalgic - really very, very beautiful!

Regarding longevity: not perceivable on the skin the next morning, unfortunately a chamomile echo in hairspray on the test strip.

(Addendum: no joke. The test strip just fell into my coffee cup... doesn’t smell bad at all... but unfortunately, the hairspray note also comes through here).

For me, Mémoire d’une Odeur is a beautiful time-travel scent that reminds me of Ninfeo Mio by Goutal from the composition (I’ll get to that another time), and I would tend to place it in spring and late summer. Whether I will get it, I’m not sure yet, as both the very herbaceous opening and the hairspray touch at the end do not immediately harmonize with my skin chemistry. But I will definitely continue to test it.
----------------------------------
With heartfelt thanks to Sweetyy for the decant."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,12/18/2019,Leimbacher,M,2870,,22,Tea Whirlwind,"There it stood, in the men's section, between the Sauvages and Codes of this world. I had expected the new Gucci to be more in the women's category, despite its unisex character, but it doesn't really matter where I find it. The main thing is that I could finally smell it, as chamomile scents are rare. And let's just say: now I know (again) why...

I believe that in my Müller, it will hardly find any friends among men. Too specific, too strange, too androgynous, too tea-like it seems at first. It doesn't fit between ""Invictus"" and ""Cool Water."" And yet, it is one of the cleverest and boldest new releases of the fragrance year. It starts with a shimmering-synthetic chamomile. This creates confusion somewhere between grandma and chemistry lab. But it invites you to sniff and awakens my curiosity. Not that I particularly like it, but it was a new scent experience somewhere between Hermes and Bulgari. And new olfactory experiences are something even a seasoned veteran enjoys (also/especially?). And in the new (designer) releases at the end of the 2010s, deviations from norms and trends must also be sought with a magnifying glass and thus welcomed.

This ""memory of a scent"" transitions from the aggressive chamomile to herbal flowers, all underpinned by a honeyed musk, more bitter and special than sweet. Very anti-mass taste, very classic and refined. A bit dusty and far too quickly gone, but the underlying idea is daring and great. But when should one wear it? Probably either all the time or never. A very eccentric interpretation of chamomile. Romance turned up to 11. And yet, it’s over the hill in no time. Strange. Confusing. Disturbingly calming. Takes some getting used to. Inaccessible. Thick eggs with a quiet flap. Do you have to be a chamomile fan for this? Or can those who are not appreciate this quirky interpretation?! Morillas on a confrontational course. Not natural. If you look closely, but somehow timeless and certainly not boring. You just have to concentrate and hurry, because it quickly becomes, fittingly, just a memory...

Bottle: elegant, classic, good in hand
Sillage: quiet, quite quiet. Luckily, because as I said, it irritates some. I chamomile, I do not chill.
Longevity: 5 hours after applying it, hardly a trace remains

Conclusion: far from the idea that tea pleases everyone and never causes offense... this piercing, polarizing chamomile bomb can definitely come across as stubborn and repulsive to some. Others will fall in love. I have not yet decided, seeing both pros and cons. Not one for the top or flop year lists, but a genuine, timeless divider that shows courage and is worth exploring further. Better than a slick, please-everyone type. Morillas unleashed."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,02/17/2021,JaneAmber,F,3,,29,A Walk,"No, I certainly won't write a factual treatise.

No dissecting tables to uncover secrets, rather a little rendezvous, an encounter between two unexpected ones.
Already impressed by Bloom and lured by this wonderfully green bottle,
I tried the new fragrance from Gucci shortly after its release.
It was pure disappointment.
A delicate nothing that led me, in my disbelief, to spray a few decent bursts on skin and clothing. In the hope that, far from dominant foreign scents, its soul would reveal itself, Mémoire remained silent, as if refusing me conversation.
Consequently, I refrained from purchasing it, but something about this perfume had triggered a desire in me to seek its presence again and again.
Today I believe I know that it was the initial chamomile. As a cushion-forming perennial, I had planted it years ago between old natural stone slabs, and typical for herbs, it released a wonderfully aromatic scent with the slightest touch. A bit like in the old pharmacies with their dark wooden counters and stone mortars, where many healing substances were ground.

Fate gifted me with a few samples, and I decided to give Mémoire the undivided time and attention necessary to get to know each other.
This new way of encountering allowed me to not truly perceive the composition in its details, but to gradually understand it as a whole construct.
Slowly, a deeper meaning emerged, even if with secrets still unrevealed.

This perfume is truly not for the impatient, not a party pleaser, not neat and tidy for the office every day, not a fresh kick on hot days.
This scent demands an appointment, long walks with the fascinating unknown, and not measuring time with the clock.

Like a soul, it will never be fully grasped.
How wonderful."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,08/06/2019,Elisa,F,26,,21,Has Vintage Potential,"Wow, what a successful new fragrance! The house of Gucci continues its unconventional path and presents us with an unusual mild-spicy scent that pleasantly stands out from the overly sweet gourmand mainstream of today. The mild chamomile note is at the forefront throughout the entire fragrance journey and becomes spicier in the base with musk and woods. Not for everyone’s nose, but ""Memoire d'une odeur"" will surely find its admirers. Has classic and vintage potential."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,02/11/2022,Annesyb,F,6,,28,Somehow. Poetry.,"What a beautiful scent! I admit that I was initially attracted by the bottle - I had almost forgotten that I usually get along quite well with Gucci fragrances.

I had the Mémoire d'une Odeur in a package with several samples and, to be honest, I feared it might be too funky grassy based on the reviews. Good in theory, but probably not for me. Not at all. I first sprayed it on paper, was immediately thrilled, and then it was the first one I applied to my skin.

A truly unusual fragrance. A very very herbal-metallic opening, then woods, green, and of course chamomile. Contrary to many other opinions, I find the chamomile to be very subtle. After 10 minutes, a certain floral herbal+pudry sweetness develops, which later transitions into a chamomile-woody-grassy-vanilla scent. But everything is incredibly transparent and light. For me: Beautiful, ethereal, and natural. Picking chamomile bouquets that wither immediately, but your fingers still smell of them all evening. Late summer meadows with a low sun, lightness and carefreeness, ripe fields standing so splendidly that they already announce thunderstorms and a change in temperature... Perhaps it takes certain memories to appreciate the scent. And yet, yes, this is how I want to smell! The name is programmatic, it evokes memories and transports me to a time when I was happy.

However, it is really, really subtle. I can imagine two types of opponents for this fragrance. Those who simply cannot relate to the scent profile and those who like it but find it too weak. I also have to keep smelling my wrist to perceive it and have thought to myself that it could be more intense... But - then it wouldn't have the same character.
So definitely not a scent that others immediately notice when you enter a room; it stays with you. An intimate fragrance. Longevity is there, but it quickly transitions into a body scent where it is almost hardly perceptible. I hardly believe it is a fragrance that one gets complimented on; one is rather perceived as pleasantly scented, but not perfumed.

For me, someone who does not care much for expansive fragrances with heavy sillage and who prefers green-grassy-herb-floral-powdery scents, I am already a big advocate of this fragrance. Very unique and quirky, definitely not to everyone's taste. Despite the pretty and decorative bottle, definitely do not order blind; I believe you either love or hate the Mémoire d'une Odeur. For me, however, it is almost a poetic fragrance."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,09/09/2019,IrisMann,M,78,,18,It starts with a cup of chamomile tea with honey.,"Finally, I made it to our provincial capital Münster today. There is not only one of the turquoise branches there. I also wanted to test this highly debated little fragrance.

So I headed straight for the Gucci shelf. The beautiful packaging was already smiling at me. This lovely shade of green with the golden stars looks very vintage. It feels like the 50s. But the tester was missing. The very nice saleswoman seemed to have not only professional competence but also quickly found the object of desire again. A beautiful classic bottle that also reminds more of the 50s than the hippie era.

Then I sprayed it on the test strip and on my skin. The fragrance opens with a cup of lukewarm chamomile tea with honey. I remember that scent from my childhood. The home remedy for a bad cold. The top note lasts about half an hour. Then the heart note appears and strongly reminds me of damp new paper. I believe that Mr. Morillas has borrowed a bit from Mr. Frédéric Malle and the ""Une Fleur de Cassie"" that was released there. In this high-end fragrance, you also find a bit of that mustiness, which then dissolves into deep melancholy. For the base note, Mr. Morillas referenced another creation from the Malle edition, namely ""Geranium pour Monsieur."" Both base notes are strikingly similar.

The fragrance is something different. I'm already pleased about that. The longevity of the base is quite good. It lasts over 6 hours on me. The sillage, however, is terrible. The scent stays very close to the skin.

Conclusion! For a label like Gucci, which has often been noted for mediocre mainstream products lately, this fragrance composition is very daring. You can see it in the very controversial discussions and the very different comments and statements. But finally, something is being dared again. Of course, one can also stumble in the process, but just the same synthetic fragrance goo or the overly sweet slightly floral generic scent have been enough to annoy me in recent years. Let’s commend those responsible at Gucci for perhaps not so easy decision to launch this fragrance. It doesn't happen so often in the perfume market anymore. In the end, the product is supposed to make money. The great times of fashion designers selling us a luxurious dream are unfortunately over."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,08/23/2021,Janacelina,F,2,HELPFUL REVIEW,25,Memory of a Summer,"To name a perfume ""Mémoire""/""Memory"" is actually quite presumptuous. (Scent) memories are not predetermined; they arise organically in each individual life, and certainly not according to plan. ""Mémoire d'une Odeur"" also does not coincidentally smell like anything concrete that I personally associate with special moments. But still. ""Memory"" captures it quite accurately...."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,10/11/2019,Lilalique,F,18,,18,"Come, let's travel...","Heart: Come, let's go on a trip // Head: Oh yes, gladly (excited) where to? // Heart: To a time long past. You surely remember, it smelled so beautiful everywhere. So fresh, so green and cozy. // Head: Yes, wait... I think I remember... I have a memory of a scent. I see green meadows, snow-covered mountains, blooming fields of chamomile, fresh hay, and oh the beautiful trees. The wood, it caresses my nose. // ""Come,"" said the heart to the head, ""let yourself go, switch off and dream a little...""

That was roughly the communication in my inner self when I sprayed this fragrance. It is so completely different from the candy scents of today. Therefore, it also leads to a ""uurgh, what is that"" upon first spray. But, you have to take your time with this scent. It is advisable to read the ingredients first and then spray. Sniff without expectation.

The bottle: Super. Absolutely in theme with the scent. Vintage par excellence. No retro gimmicks, like ""this is how it used to be."" No! It is like it used to be.

The scent: Wonderful harmony of chamomile, woods, and meadows. Featherlight. A bit of vanilla brings the harmony. A sunny day on a freshly mown mountain meadow in the Dolomites. Absolutely unisex.

Sillage: Initially quite strong, also bitter, but it weakens relatively quickly. After about 45 minutes, it develops into a skin-close scent without fading. It distributes a pleasant hint to its surroundings with every movement.

Longevity: I would say it could be a bit longer. If you prefer it more intense, the tendency is to re-spray after about 1 hour. The sprayer mists the perfume pleasantly fine, so reapplying is not an overwhelming issue.

Conclusion: A candidate for purchase. Stands out from the crowd. Individual. A successful year-round fragrance. Yes, it is the memory of a scent that everyone carries within themselves."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,08/23/2019,Rajudaph,F,39,HELPFUL REVIEW,18,Delicate as a Flower...,"I liked the packaging of Memoire d'une Odeur: a rich warm green with golden stars. The pink interior matches perfectly. I find it very feminine but not unisex. The light green glass bottle looks classic and resembles an antique column.
The scent is delicate, enchantingly light. Primarily chamomile. The vanilla adds a slightly sweet touch to the chamomile. A harmonious fragrance combination. The flower head of the Roman chamomile is innocent white. The flower interior is yellow-green and resembles the daisy. A playful flower, just like the scent. Cedarwood mixes with sandalwood and noble woods. Everything is just very light and weightless. The chamomile-vanilla blend is always in the foreground. The mourning tree, a type of cypress, grows in mild southern climates. Does it provide the spice?
In my opinion, Memoire d'une Odeur does not have sillage. I can smell it at most for 3 hours on my wrist. A wonderful spring-summer fragrance that seemingly only I perceive on myself."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,01/31/2023,NeverPerfect,M,12,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,30,Days of Future Past,"Herb and heavy, the chamomile blossoms open up. The unfurled jasmine and chamomile flowers are ethereal and move more lightly, but never lose their grip thanks to the dry woods in the base. There is a touch of sensuality in the scent due to the musk.
A wonderful cool, herbaceous floral fragrance that touches me deeply in the soul and embodies both a beautiful melancholy and a restrained joy at the same time. It is always a lovely surprise when you awaken from a dream and still perceive this scent upon waking.

It is probably my favorite perfume, at least my most personal perfume, which I wear rather rarely because I don't quite feel ready for it yet. Many associate memories from the past with the fragrance, which the name is also meant to imply, but for me, it represents the future. In the perfume, I recognize the person I would like to be, the person I could be, but am not yet, which is why I don't always feel quite ready to wear it more often, as I have not yet lived up to my own expectations. At the moment, the perfume is also an expression of my emotional vulnerability, just as this review fundamentally shows the tenderness of a person.
So I look forward to the day when I can do justice to the scent as a person and wear it more freely.

In the end, hopefully, all that remains to say is Days of Future Passed."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,11/18/2020,Laurali,F,8,,19,The Horse Girl and the Diaper Cream,"A quick note: I am not a typical horse girl (anymore). My time of riding is long gone. Sometimes I look back with a tear in my eye, but my sporting interests have changed, and that’s okay.

Nevertheless, I can still vividly remember the beautiful summer evenings I spent at the stable. After a long ride, cleaning the horse and bringing it to the pasture. To finish off, sitting on a hay bale with my best friend, watching the sunset and chatting about everyday life. The scent of dry grass mixed with the smell of hay & straw in my nose and the warm evening sun on my skin.

Once home, I would first rinse off the horse smell in the shower and quickly apply cream - with diaper cream. I love the scent of baby products. Shampoo, bath foam, body cream - all found in my bathroom.

But now to Mémoire d'une Odeur:
Just like my described typical day at the stable, I perceive this fragrance - in the same progression.
It starts off hay-like/strawy through the chamomile, but after a short time, it develops into a powdery direction. The musk makes it clean and cozy. It smells exactly like diaper cream to me. All of this happens on my skin within two hours. Unfortunately, I can hardly perceive it afterwards, which sadly does not make it a candidate for purchase for me.

Nevertheless, it serves as a small reminder of the beautiful summer evenings at the stable, and when I want to be reminded of it again, I will rummage through my drawer for the little sample, spray it on, and indulge in memories."

Mémoire d'une Odeur,03/06/2023,Fulidu,F,19,HELPFUL REVIEW,28,Melancholy and Joy are Probably Sisters (Erich Kästner),"I spray the fragrance for the first time just before going to bed. What I perceive is slightly medicinal, almost biting. But this only lasts a few moments and then there it is - the chamomile. I see in my mind's eye hot summer days when my sister and I played on the lawn behind our house as children. Not a lush green lawn, as the heat has turned it dusty yellow. There are no flowers, just these chamomiles without petals that smell in the sun like the tea that Mom always brews when we are sick. A bit like baby bath additive too. And Mémoire d'une Odeur smells exactly like that - soft and warm, like a hug from Mom or Grandma. I consciously do not mention Dad or Grandpa, as the scent radiates something very feminine and comforting for me. Just like the mother who holds you in her arms when you have fallen and strokes your hair. If I had to name a fragrance that stands for ""security,"" it would undoubtedly be this one.

But even the coziest hug eventually comes to an end, and this happens quite quickly here. I perceive Mémoire d'une Odeur on my skin for about two hours; it lasts a bit longer on clothing. But that doesn’t bother me, quite the opposite: a ""fantastic longevity"" or ""monster sillage"" would not suit this fragrance. It is quiet and delicate and doesn’t want to be anything else. The scent progression is very linear (though I have no idea how a weeping tree smells - does anyone know...?). I sense a minimal hint of musk more than I actually perceive it. Mémoire d'une Odeur is not a fragrance I will wear in everyday life. Not because I don’t like it. It makes me happy, almost brings me to tears at the same time. Because it was so beautiful back then. Because it will never be like that again. The memory - that remains."

Simply because this fragrance is so beautiful: It radiates calm, warmth, and security. Nothing that hits hard or has a killer sillage/projection. But I don't want that at all with this scent. I find it too ""intimate"" to share it with others. I want to wear it for myself. Wear it when the soul needs a little break... Whether from pain, stress, sorrow... Or even from too much euphoria.

Mémoire d'une Odeur,09/03/2019,Scandinavica,F,17,,8,Night under the... Chamomile Stars?,"I immediately noticed the stylish retro bottle, and the scent itself is said to be something special as well. It is not feminine or fruity-floral, but calm, sleepy, and green - sounds lovely!

When freshly applied, the top note reminds me a bit of a Russian children's cream with chamomile and fresh hay. I enjoy this herbal-dry aroma because it reminds me of the fields near our former house in late summer.
Unfortunately, after about ten minutes, there is not much chamomile left; instead, a bitter woodiness takes over and does not feel warm and spicy. I suspect the Prijat (""mourning tree"") is to blame.
The scent has now become much more of a bland... Well, muffin, and I feel like I am wearing an old piece of clothing that has finally seen the light of day after sitting in the closet for a long time. What a shame.

Perhaps it is because I am sweating a lot in this weather, and the scent cannot unfold much potential on such damp skin, but the fabulous 8+ ratings here almost shock me."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,02/05/2020,Scentator,M,2,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,"Unfortunately, really just the memory of a scent","I was mainly captivated by the top note of this perfume, as it really excited me and I was a bit careless. I still like the scent; it's actually quite a nice fragrance. With one huge drawback: as soon as you've had it on your skin for a few minutes, you feel like you only imagined having applied it. If you then bring your nose to the spot where you sprayed it, you can perceive it easily and it's not that weak. But the nose should really touch the skin. It creates a whole new dimension and definition of the term ""close to the skin.""
However, I must make one significant concession: the scent lives up to its name; it's just the memory of a scent.
Still, I'm not selling or giving away the bottle just yet - I think it looks great on the shelf, it really does look fantastic."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,12/19/2021,Aralca,F,3,,13,Venezia,"The first time I smelled the fragrance was after I bought a new mascara and a sample ended up in my bag.

At home - it was a pleasantly warm early summer day and I was out cycling - a few spritzes landed on my wrist.

I was quite astonished, as I had never smelled anything like this in a perfume before.
I like chamomile.
The yellow-white spots on green meadows lift my spirits.
I drink it as tea when I want to feel secure.

The musk is very gentle and provides a soft bed for the chamomile.

And then the cedarwood comes in and embraces it all.

I purchased the beautiful flacon a few weeks later.

Its greatest use so far has been on a hot summer day in Venice, starting in the morning on the Vaporetto on the Canal Grande and ending in a fine little ristorante at the far end of Cannaregio. I wore a light silk dress that day, and memoire carried me through the day and the heat with graceful calm, with a refreshment in the early afternoon, in this wonderful city.

Mémoire d'une Odeur,12/02/2019,AnJa,F,19,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Dreamy,"This beautiful memory scent makes me sad.....

But let's start from the beginning.
I tested it in the perfume shop and gave it some time. It needs that. It has to ""settle."" The scent is simply different. After half an hour, I was sure I absolutely had to have it. I quickly dashed back to the perfume shop, sprayed it on again, and enchanted as I was, immediately packed the largest size. No one has ever captivated me like that. Wonderfully beautiful.
It actually starts with a mild chamomile, then becomes cozy woody, vanilla, just so homey and comforting. I am completely blown away.
That’s about it for the scent progression. But I don’t find that bad at all. I love this feel-good factor it brings. It really touched me, as KVolteer mentioned in the comment before me.

BUT: it doesn’t last. It’s gone again immediately. Occasionally a hint comes by and lets me take a deep breath and dream. But that’s too little for me. I want to smell LIKE THIS. But for real. ;) I am deeply ""in love."" Why is it so short-lived? That’s so, so sad."

Because - it presents me with quite a few puzzles. This happens to me extremely rarely; I can't quite remember when and with which perfume this ""phenomenon"" has occurred before.
With these ""memories of a pleasant scent,"" I am dealing on one hand with a ""quiet presence,"" but on the other with a ""deeply engaging"" odor.
At times, it powerfully seeks the proximity of my nose, while at other times, it seems to wave goodbye from afar. When it comes closer again, it is not exactly as before; similar, yes, but with different accents. This interplay lasts for several hours.
It has something of an herb meadow in early autumn, also something subtly ""medicinal,"" which probably stems from the quite prominent ""Roman Chamomile.""
Deeper within, one can perceive forest-like chords that seem quite woody, but also remind one of freshly fallen, damp leaves. One term that comes to mind is slightly yellowed old books that smell faintly of ""lignin."" In a library whose large windows overlook a somewhat overgrown garden.
Herb-sweet - with a tendency towards bitter - the secret cannot be fully unraveled. And it doesn't have to be. Yet it keeps prompting me to sniff again, leaving a little question mark behind. Magical? -- But of course!!"
Mémoire d'une Odeur,06/02/2023,Genoveva,F,50,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,18,The Scent of Childhood,"Many reviewers describe a feeling of security that they associate with this fragrance. I can only agree!
It captured my heart the moment I was finally able to smell it for the first time. My first and so far only blind buy. I have not regretted it. So what do I perceive when I wear it... First, an almost lemony note that I search for in the fragrance pyramid in vain, but it is there, followed by the scent of freshly cut grass that has been lying in the summer sun for a while... Then there is the chamomile, not at all bitter as initially suspected, but warm and sweet. I am reminded of a hug from my grandmother, who never wore perfume, who simply smelled clean and of plain chamomile hand cream. It is a small trip back to long-gone childhood days...
Certainly not a scent that impresses the opposite sex, but I believe that is not its intention. I am still relatively at the beginning of my fragrance journey, and one reason I started it was that I was looking for scents that would put me in certain moods... Just six months ago, I owned only one perfume, and I hardly ever wore it. Then I began to remember which fragrances I liked and owned in the past - 20 years ago. Some were still available, so I repurchased them. Pleasures by Estee Lauder, ardenbeauty by Elizabeth Arden, and L'eau d'issey by Issey Miyake. Now I continue to see what encounters me and enchants me, testing through decants and discovering a whole new world... Memoir d'une Odeur is a memory, as the name suggests, that is very precious to me."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,04/11/2021,Snowrose,F,5,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,15,"Like a Novel, Patience is Rewarded","For a long, long time, I circled around this fragrance. The bottle is so beautiful, yet the many negative voices about the disturbing chamomile made me hesitate. Then I managed to get a miniature, and patiently I waited, and both for me and my partner, the controversial scent struck immediately - so the bottle was allowed to move in!

The opening is green, herbal, yes, but in a very interesting way that I surprisingly do not find disturbing. This may be due to the vanilla, which adds a warmth that makes me want to be patient. I don’t have to wait long until the chamomile is hardly noticeable - the musk with the wood-vanilla mix surrounds me like a walk on a mild spring/summer evening. A certain creaminess makes me think of high-quality (sun) cream (never, ever forget SPF!), which even brings a hint of vacation feelings. But not in a sentimental wanderlust sense, rather: I have done my day's work and enjoy the season!

A subtle fragrance that can create memories as a special feature, while also elegantly highlighting everyday life to cradle in memories that could have been sketched from novels: It takes time to fully absorb this scent!"

My mother would lay dried chamomile flowers on the porch. Whenever it was siesta time and a breeze blew, I would wrinkle my nose because it reminded me of past colds. And now? When I smell the chamomile, I see white bed sheets fluttering in the wind, the golden fields outside our village, the swing on which I carefree swayed back and forth. Now I feel secure, grounded, at home with this aroma.

I appreciate that Mémoire d'une Odeur has neither incredible longevity nor sillage. Because this fragrance, this memory, is meant to be just for me."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,08/30/2019,Dkay31,M,19,,7,Pride comes before the fall ....,"Hello everyone :)

I was totally hyped about this perfume, I read from many that it was something special, especially I was keen on the bottle (I am also a packaging collector), but as the saying goes, you smell with your nose and not with your eyes.

Today I was at Karstadt and sniffed this scent both on the test strip and on my skin (with the Absolu it was criticized that I should test things on my skin in the future, so I did :) ) ... At first, it smells very citrusy to me, which I found very pleasant, but in the dry down, it smells quite musty, I can't quite describe which spice that should be, but musty indeed, so my pure joy for this perfume was quickly dampened and I am now considering switching to another one, although the prices are quite steep.

40ML 67 €
60ML 82 € (could also be 80)
100ML 114 € (uhm yeah ^^)

The bottle is a true feast for the eyes, resembling an ancient Roman column with a gold-colored cap and a turquoise blue fragrance liquid, featuring a very elegant inscription and a golden border, a real eye-catcher, but as mentioned above, you pay for the scent and not for the bottle.

I recently wrote a statement about how good it smells on my husband. I couldn't describe it, because none of the listed notes stood out. He just smelled great with it. I also have the feeling that unisex fragrances with a slightly rugged touch simply suit him better and last longer, because his skin just absorbs every scent immediately ;)

Recently, my package from Flaconi arrived. And what was included as a sample? Yes, this fragrance. I considered giving it to my boyfriend, as I didn't want to smell it on myself (yes, the comments are not the best). But I was brave and sprayed it on my wrist.

Alberto, what is this????

I mean, yes, the scent is unusual, I have to give it that. I think that's good. But sorry, I felt sick right away! And I am actually not sensitive (Is that how you spell it? haha).

I close my eyes and imagine someone holding an old, already cold chamomile tea bag under my nose. I'm not a fan of chamomile, but now and then I drink chamomile tea. There are worse smells, like caraway (ugh), but this really exceeds everything. This is not a pleasant chamomile, really not..

Furthermore, there are woody notes present, which I don't really pick up. It just ""smells"" musty, old, and really - as already mentioned here - slightly like rubber. *shudder*.

Positive: It doesn't really last long. (for me, however, too long) After an hour, it was gone, thank God.
No trace of vanilla and sandalwood, it just remains musty.

I have removed the good rating I gave it. Because now I have tested it. One gets the sample, because I want to get rid of it as quickly as possible!!"
Mémoire d'une Odeur,07/28/2022,Leen86,F,9,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,15,All or nothing,"I have to admit that I really struggled with the choice of perfume for my first review. Should I pick a scent that everyone loves? Or something more well-known? In the end, I chose one that I felt I needed to protect. Just like it is there for me.
I watched some YouTubers who had extremely controversial opinions about Mémoire d'une Odeur. I just had to test this ""Chamomile Hammer.""
I ordered the 7.4 ml with this rollerball applicator - no big loss if I don't like it after all.
I found the small green sliding cardboard box decorated with stars to be quite charmingly romantic.
About the scent:
You immediately smell the chamomile, very herbal, almost like those chamomile steam baths I was put in as a child whenever I was sick. There's also a bit of country road with hay bales in there. At first, I didn't like the scent at all... too harsh, too green... just not my thing. I also have to say that I'm not a fan of chamomile tea; the association with being sick is just too present. But I learned from a YouTuber that the best scents need time to develop. So I kept my arm away from my nose for a couple of hours. I still perceive the chamomile cloud around me, but it becomes softer, warmer, creamier... when I finally dared to take a sniff, there it was - vanilla! I love vanilla scents. Especially green, herbal vanilla. It shouldn't be too sweet. I think that's what makes the scent so unisex, that it doesn't become overly sweet.
When my husband came home, he immediately said: ""Oh, you smell really nice."" I then reapplied it fresh to show him the top note. He couldn't believe it was the same scent. He even wrinkled his nose.
By now, I even love the opening, and how could it be otherwise - the 100 ml bottle (this beautiful turquoise vintage bottle with the golden cap) adorns my shelf.
I want to protect this scent, by which I mean I want to speak a good word for it, because I often hear how terrible it smells, while I find it so wonderful, comforting, and embracing. For a designer scent, it's very bold and special, but it has opened a big door for me on my journey into the niche world. I no longer let top notes blind me.
I wore it in spring and summer - you can't really overdo it. However, I can't say anything yet about its suitability for wool sweaters."

She works in the arts and has a very special aesthetic. At that time, I didn’t have the courage to approach her to ask about the scent.
The scent lingered in my nose for quite a while.

About a year later, I was in a perfume shop looking for another fragrance. That’s when I noticed the beautiful green bottle. It seemed to me like it had been magically transported from the 70s to the shelf.

When a spray landed on my wrist, I almost flipped out: IT IS THE FRAGRANCE.

I am delighted every time I use it and associate it with a cozy, high-quality, warm feeling.

Again, you can tell it's either a hate or, as some might say, a big love scent... For me, definitely a hate! I have to give this fragrance some credit; it is definitely something special but also new, something I haven't smelled anywhere else until now! Anyway, every time I sprayed the scent on the test strip, I got a strange kind of goosebumps... Not because it blew me away!

Upon spraying, I could smell a very sharp + penetrating pistachio note... (Am I the only one who could smell pistachios?) ... shortly after, the chamomile became very noticeable... But I must admit, I'm not a big fan of this note. The chamomile note is very, very bitter on my skin but also extremely piercing :((( Musk gave me the final blow! It wasn't that fresh + pleasant musk, but rather a very unpleasant, artificial, and overly powdery musk note... The woody notes came through occasionally during the scent development; they were very subtle, which I personally found quite disappointing! Since I really like beautiful and noble woody notes in fragrances. The only note I couldn't smell at all was unfortunately the vanilla... It stayed in the background :(

Many are probably thinking that I'm condemning this perfume... No, I'm definitely not! I just didn't like this perfume; it's not really a fragrance direction I prefer! But still, I wanted to give the scent a chance! Despite testing it multiple times, I just didn't like this fragrance!"

A butterfly lands on my hand.
I want to catch it,
but it flies away!

Yes, autumn is progressing and soon winter will arrive again. It still buzzes sporadically in the garden and now and then I even see a butterfly flutter by.

A subtly bitter chamomile starts immediately, then it is enveloped by delicate green woods. What does a weeping tree smell like? I don't know. Probably very inconspicuous. But it beautifully connects with the chamomile. Then a hint of musk comes in, making the chamomile softer - almost creamy.

I am still waiting for the dry-down. It is slowly becoming more and more delicate. Just a light breeze of transparent little wings. The wood is only barely perceptible and the vanilla is very hidden as well. I continue to sniff at my hand and catch a remnant of the sandalwood-vanilla finish.

And quickly it is just a lovely memory.

I find it difficult to find beautiful green fragrances. But I like this one very much, even though it appears so delicate and fragile. Therefore, it is best to spray it at home for cuddling and linger with a cup of tea in hand, reminiscing about the beautiful memories of spring and summer.

I don't understand the bad reviews. The sillage and longevity are very low, but the scent is beautiful."

Just kidding, no I found it quite okay on the first test. Even though the scent tends to be torn apart online, my memory of the fragrance was positive. It would have been different if Tom Ford had released it in the Private Blend in a completely emerald green bottle; I would have been curious if it might have been received better.
In the style of Rose Prick.

Today at 32 degrees and with a planned trip to the lake, I thought it was a good day for this scent. I already figured it might need more warmth.
Since I always remembered the fragrance as a delicate floral water, I thought
5, 6 sprays are easy and off we go.

And boom, hello? Who are you? With each spray, I instantly noticed how it became sweeter. My memory of this scent was already different.
At 32 degrees, the floral notes suddenly became completely alive, as if you were riding a bike along a gravel path by the stream, the smell of a warm road, warm skin, and the bushes and flowers along the stream.
Fresh wind in my face,
so loud that you can hardly hear anything else.
That’s how the memory of this scent suddenly smelled, and I was very happy with my choice for the day.
It needs heat. I had such an extreme scent bubble around me for 3 hours. And my date said I smelled great like sunscreen.
I thought, well, 2 sprays would have done it too, but I didn’t expect it to suddenly come to life in the heat.
I find the scent smells mega authentic, without synthetics, and I suddenly like it a lot, precisely because it is so “different.”

Since I tested it directly on my skin and not on a paper strip, I had to endure the scent for the rest of the day, and I must say that in the end, I was positively surprised. After a while, the fragrance developed into an extremely pleasant, fresh-woody direction. But not this “freshly washed laundry lemon-fresh,” rather this “fresh forest air-fresh.” The smell of this perfume reminds me of a beautiful girl running through a fairytale forest in a loose dress. I couldn’t stop sniffing my hand.

When the bottle arrived, I was really impressed with the flacon. Somehow timeless and yet a homage to the old times!
I found the flacon simply brilliant and I liked it a lot. The first impression was already successful.
While testing, I found the scent to be “okay”
It was fresh and smelled pleasant, and especially the chamomile stood out beautifully, yet this scent did not blow me away and I did not feel the urge to wear it, so it ended up in a drawer!

Last weekend, I had an appointment and was pondering what would fit today, opened the drawer and thought to myself “why not”! You really can't go wrong with this scent.
Moreover, it is not too intrusive, and I remember that this scent smelled quite fresh.
So the decision was made: This is the one!
At first, I didn't really notice the scent, but over time and especially with the spring-like weather, this scent really got to me and I felt that feeling of spring! It highlighted the sunshine and the green that was slowly sprouting everywhere perfectly!
The chamomile and the freshness just fit perfectly with spring.
It's like listening to a song that is “okay,” but when you hear the song in a certain situation/mood, it fits and completely captures you!
That's how it is with this scent in spring!
For me, this scent best describes what I perceive in spring and what spring evokes in me. Joy, enjoyment, freshness, being free, and yet a certain lightness!
And the more I wear it on such days, especially now, the more I fall in love with it!

I see a Victorian greenhouse in late spring, when it is pleasantly warm in the morning, but the midday heat has not yet arrived, more of a between time than a before or after.
The plants inside grow wildly intertwined, all in various shades of green, with the occasional blossom peeking through the leaves, in white, yellow, or other cheerful colors.
The first rays of sunshine filter through the slightly dusty windows and brighten the room. Hopeful, they warm it against the cold that was for what is to come. A nostalgic coziness, a memory (of a scent), from another time...

Mémoire d'une Odeur,09/14/2022,Animilovic,M,134,,7,Unisex?! Maybe when men go extinct,"Basically, I am a big fan of unisex fragrances. After all, they are not bound to appeal to a specific gender, but can move between gender boundaries, allowing for more creativity. But how does Gucci fare with its first unisex fragrance?

""With the new fragrance direction 'mineral-aromatic', which arises from the combination of Roman chamomile and Indian coral jasmine, Gucci Mémoire d'Une Odeur cannot be assigned to either gender or time of day."" - Of course, the classification into more masculine or feminine is a matter of opinion, and some men may enjoy this scent, but if you ask me, this is a purely women's perfume. Therefore, it doesn't surprise me that of the 454 users who own this fragrance on Parfumo, 73 percent are women. Before I ordered the 7.4ml version, I was also a bit confused, as the scent seemed rather feminine.

Translated, the name of the perfume means ""Memory of a Scent,"" and as absurd as it sounds, this fragrance reminds me of my mother's hairspray, which she used 20 years ago. Of course, it's nice when scents evoke memories, but I don't necessarily need my mother's hairspray on my neck.
The fragrance is quite linear and doesn't change much. You can definitely smell the chamomile, but it's somehow difficult to describe. I can't clearly identify and describe the other notes. I actually believe that I've never had such a hard time describing the scent of a perfume as I do in this case.

The perfume is very unobtrusive, which is probably also due to its poor performance. Since I usually use four sprays on my neck, it was difficult to create the same conditions this time, as the 7.4ml version is delivered as a roll-on. But even when applied generously, the scent barely lasted two hours in my self-perception.

The packaging and bottle are simple, but somehow fit the fragrance quite well. I find 100ml for about 74 euros a bit much, considering the poor performance.

Let's hypothetically assume that I had a girlfriend and she wore this fragrance; my nose would probably have no objections even if it doesn't blow me away, BUT on my neck, it is completely out of place."

This Gucci understands that masterfully!
Who hasn’t had to drink chamomile tea in childhood when plagued by a nasty stomach upset? Memories of caring parents or grandparents come rushing back. No matter how bad the chamomile tea may have tasted, the comforting feeling of security and being cared for remains through the scent of the brewing tea.
Who doesn’t remember the chamomile-lined edges of golden grain fields and green pastures during long walks? The relaxation that set in?
The nostalgically beautiful green bottle fits very well with the overall impression that the perfume conveys. The scent starts with chamomile, unusual and more niche than designer. The chamomile remains from start to finish. Initially strong and almost alone, the other notes gradually join in: The powdery chamomile supported by musk followed by a soft creamy chamomile through woods and sandalwood. In the end, beautifully nestled in vanilla.
It is exactly this scent progression, with the retention of the chamomile odor, that creates the memory that makes this fragrance so unique for me. I never thought I would like the perfume so much.
For me, it is not a perfume for going out but rather for home and everyday wear, providing a sense of well-being as soon as one of the chamomile clouds reaches the nose."
Mémoire d'une Odeur,08/14/2024,Landrie,F,32,,3,In Search of the Lost Chamomile,"After a long consideration, I made a blind buy. I was looking forward to a herbal chamomile scent.

In fact, I can hardly smell any chamomile at all. I'm disappointed; the scent is nice. Nothing more. It becomes extremely close to the skin after just 15 minutes. It feels more like a body spray. Hmm. The best thing about this fragrance is the bottle."

I think the bottle fits the DNA of the fragrance perfectly. Definitely a green scent. However, since there is always a rather feminine floral accord present, I am really not sure if I would classify Mémoire d'une Odeur as unisex. For spring, though, it is truly a dream. Unfortunately, there is a bit of synthetics involved, which, given this price, shouldn't be too heavily criticized in my estimation. The longevity is good, not outstanding but definitely acceptable. The sillage unfortunately leaves something to be desired, but it is not extremely poor either.

I am surprised that none of the reviews mention Donna Tartt and ""the secret history""

I don’t know if anyone can agree with me, but for me, this scent is exactly how I would imagine the fragrance of the twins Camilla and Charles side by side on an early spring evening.
So beautiful, yet elusive, and with a palpable sad longing for something that can never be brought back.

I am a true fan of this scent and perceive it as a true masterpiece of olfactory art.

However, I find that Gucci has made a mistake by marketing it as a perfume. In my eyes, it is closer to a self-care product, and even if it may be decadent, it is really not something one buys for others or to please, but as a token of love for oneself.

It is like a new category for me, something I had not known before.

My favorite way to use it is after a hot bath or shower, to wrap myself in it, mix myself a Baptiste (cognac, maple, cider), read a little, and then use memoire for what it does best: to enchant my pillow before going to sleep and carry me away.

Am I asking too much? Maybe yes, but that’s what I want from perfume, and that’s why I never have just one. And even on the same day, the scent I put on in the morning, probably in the evening, no longer suits me. This morning, a lazy, foggy Sunday in April, I woke up to the addition of tuberose. And Gucci Bloom worked my desire perfectly.

I admit, my fault; I only recently discovered the fascination of the tuberose flower since I started ignoring the genus. As an ignorant man, I have always dedicated myself to perfumes intended for a male audience who, for some unknown reason, does not include this beautiful flower in their blend. There are perfumes like Bvlgari Man in Black that contain it, but they don’t give it the proper emphasis as in fragrances intended for a female audience. An exception is Zara’s recent releases, Bois Soleil Men, where the sensual flower plays an important role.

Bloom is a floral bomb but not a complex fragrance. It is a melange of flowers to create a bohemian bouquet that treads the razor’s edge between vintage and modern, the smell of the backyard at night. Bloom has a unique packaging that immediately captured me, a linear bottle with a lacquered surface and the pale pink color of porcelain. It’s like a box of face powder. Brilliant, delicate, but so wonderfully magical. And Bloom’s powdery note was an emotion, a velvety but not crushed sensation, immersed in the enveloping tuberose and jasmine that makes everything fresh and tender. It is the perfume that is revealed little by little after the first most powerful note. Bloom is therefore not an immediate perfume but one that reveals itself with grace, caution, and freshness. And it puts the spotlight on tuberose, enriching it with jasmine and honeysuckle. Everything is fresh, with the right amount of “sweet,” the right amount of “green.”

The scent unfolds directly with a dry and flowery bouquet. It’s purely a white floral blend, but rather than edgy or jarring, it’s delicately understated and sweet. There are no notes of Hesperides or aldehydes. The first notes are divine: pure white flowers, no fruit, no citrus, no sweet notes—just like diving into a flower bush. And this sets this fragrance apart from the multitude of floral scents currently on the shelves. The creamy tuberose hit with all its splendor explodes. It is a diva, rich, sour, bitter, a touch of waxy, camphor, simply delicious. A touch of bitterness makes me think of lily-of-the-valley.

The heart is and remains a floral mix; soon, the dewy white jasmine blooms. Rich, the bud is in the background, and there is something greenish, a green element of foliage with even a hint of undergrowth. The more it grows, the greener it becomes. Jasmine peeps out from time to time but remains docile and is not indolic. Sweet but not sickly, just like pouring a drop of honey on the bud, sharp but not annoying, noisy but not disturbing. Presumably, it’s because of the tuberose, but I seem to get a gardenia-like shade. It reminds me of walking in a garden of white jasmine, gardenias, and tuberoses that bloom right after the rain, with the warm breeze hitting my face. There is a light powder that could be an iris or a soft orris mixed with something like violet leaves, but it’s probably just one aspect of the Chinese honeysuckle.

The last stage adds a honeysuckle-like aroma, which is probably the added element of the Rangoon Creeper. I love the scent of honeysuckle, mine is the common white and yellow one, and every time it blooms on my terrace, I feel happy, so maybe that’s another reason why I love Bloom. It is the sweetest component in the development of this floral cluster, but it is a civil and lovable sweetness, which is never unpleasant, intrusive, or cloying. The base is a little powdery and balsamic, with a musky undertone but still rich in tuberose. There is a soapy atmosphere, not a classic soap scent, somewhat the characteristic fragrance of Marseille soap.

It is fresh and gentle with a dreamy and diaphanous sillage and scents like a bouquet of white petals through and through but has a persistent and ubiquitous creamy undertone that never allows it to be too floral or too sweet. Indeed, linear, while the subtle undertones change over time, but the scent doesn’t need to change much when it’s interesting enough to begin with. Like a memorable painted portrait, it has a face that you can perceive again and again and see it a little differently every time. To some, it will seem too linear and without notes, but in reality, on the skin, it has enough facets not to be boring, and at the same time, it is straightforward to overlap with other perfumes. It is a clean floral scent, slightly soapy, not too sweet, relatively modest. It is an elegant floral. Brunch with friends, spring office work, a date for a summer dinner - the scent is versatile and will blend well for many occasions. Bloom falls firmly into the non-indolic realm. You’ll never find that buttery fatness that is off-putting at times.

I based the review on a 100 ml bottle I own since January 2021.

Bloom,10/16/2017,Anthology,F,18,,5,A good floral,"Beside Rush, I am not an owner of a Gucci perfume. None of them suits me. I am sorry I had no chance to smell Envy because I heard it was a beautiful creation.
Now, let’s talk about Bloom. Tuberose is a nice flower but it can be very heavy. 2017 seems to be a tuberose year: Twilly, Gabrielle and now Gucci Bloom. I bet that by the end of the year there will be more perfumes that have tuberose as a starting point.
The fragrance opens with a sweet tuberose. The sweetness comes from honeysuckle, a flower from heaven with a gorgeous smell. So, I get a sweet, wonderful tuberose because it is the diva in this composition.
The perfume is linear with a tuberose which dominates the other notes. Sweet but not sickly, sharp but not annoying, loud but not disturbing. A classic composition made for all those who love white flowers.
The dry-down is a little powdery and balsamic maybe due to orris root, but still full of tuberose.
Projection and longevity are very good.
Gucci Bloom is a very nice fragrance where the tuberose is very well represented. It is different from others perfumes and bold in its own way. A good floral for the floral lovers."
Bloom,03/10/2024,GalbanumLeaf,F,39,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,In your face floral in the best possible way,"A contemporary, buoyant floral, with a hidden green note, perhaps from the tuberose. Longevity is considerable for a white floral, and the dry down remains fresh without a sweet or powdery finish. Highly recommended for lovers of simple floral bouquets. Excellent for Spring and Summer daytime wearing and for warm spring and summer nights. But I wear Bloom anytime I need a lift. This is a bold floral that does not go by halves."
Bloom,01/08/2025,JiasmineC,F,2,,2,"Sweet, Clean Floral -- budget version of Diptyque's Do Son","The opening is a sweet, clean, and heady Jasmine. The scent doesn't really change in the drydown, and remains a very sweet floral. I don't pick up anything powdery or green, to my nose it's a pleasant, smooth sweetness throughout.
On me, across many wears on skin and clothing, the lasting power is a very poor 2 hour maximum unfortunately.
I've tested wearing Gucci Bloom and Diptyque's Do Son at the same time, and their dry downs are indiscernible to me; additionally they have the same lasting power on me. Do Son has a creamier, more delicate opening but Bloom is much cheaper."
Bloom,04/11/2025,gobtholemew,N/A,37,,3,02.07.21,"It’s 2005. I’m 6 years old. I’m hanging out with my then-25-year-old aunt in her bedroom. Gwen Stefani ‘Hollaback Girl’ is playing. This perfume smells like that moment for me. I think this is what her laundry detergent smelled like at the time. Victoria’s Secret, maybe? I wish I could offer an unbiased opinion of this because I’m sure this perfume smells great to someone who isn’t instantly transported back to their aunt’s satin sheets from 2005."
Bloom,02/25/2025,Zowie,F,54,,2,Elegant and fresh,"Very similar to Do Son by Diptque. There's pros and cons to both. Do Son has a slight biscuityness (think digestive biscuit) that I find distracting, but it's also somehow ""brighter"" than Bloom. This is a pleasant and light jasmine/tuberose. It's ever so slightly powdery as it dries down but in a way that is still very realisitic floral. I veer towards saying it's not exactly..."
Bloom,01/30/2024,MrsGuerlain,F,548,,2,In Bloom,"This is a floral scent, that can be a bit overwhelming. Even to someone who is a huge fan of jasmine and tuberose. I have a theory that because this is a simple scent, only 4 notes, I notice the notes more than I would in a more complex scent. In a more complex scent my nose and my brain will be busy trying to disassemble the fragrance. In this scent there is very little for..."
Bloom,05/28/2025,Ursaw,F,166,,2,A soft petal bed for a sleepy honey bee,"Heavy white florals. The initial cloud smells like those flowering bushes that are pretty tame and unassuming during the day, but suddenly become super fragrant on summer evenings. I can never remember their name. But they're beautiful. Humid, honeyed, warm.

I'm usually not a big fan of heavy floral scents, but I have to admit – I found myself enjoying this one quite a lot. It became sweeter as it settled on my skin and jasmine came to the forefront. I didn't feel any powderiness. On the contrary, it was very clean and easy to breathe in. Unexpectedly good, realistic flowers on a gentle creamy backdrop.

For a brief moment I thought I was falling in love. Something about this composition was very comforting. Delicate, honeyed floral sweetness. Airy warmth. It felt... safe. Like I was a little bee cradled for the night in the petals.

But then in a blink of an eye it was gone. It lasted barely longer than an hour in total, but near the end it suddenly fizzled away to a weird greenish base. ~20 more minutes and it was completely gone.

Left an overall pleasant impression except for the abrupt ending. But while I think back on it and do want more of that cozy feeling, I'd rather search for it elsewhere than fly back to the same flower I've painfully fallen out of before."
Bloom,02/18/2025,lucekingg,F,157,,1,Another Geriatric,"Got in a tester kit from Sephora (I really like buying these and playing with them), sprayed on my wrist, and immediately did a 180° turn to go scrub it off (micellar water will do the trick!). I do get a blooming sensation when I sniff which is really cool but this smells like what an old lady would wear to church. Reminds me a lot of whatever Estee Lauder (either that or something like Elizabeth Arden) my mean 5th grade teacher wore."
Bloom,05/07/2025,Ladymarie,F,50,,1,Average,"This is definitely a fragrance that evolves after wearing it. Sniffing the bottle leaves something to be desired. It’s heavily floral. I didn’t think it was exciting. However, I accidentally sprayed it on my fingers as I was spraying it on a test strip. I grew on me as the scent sat and blended with my chemistry. The dry down is a sweet, floral, creamy scent. It’s not bad at all. Just not necessarily amazing."
Bloom,09/04/2025,EmberFields,F,38,,1,Designer white floral perfection,"Gucci's Bloom is the modern designer floral par excellence. Fresh, green-tinged, and youthful, it has become somewhat of an instant classic. Indeed, it is sometimes hard to believe its distinctive floral-patterned box and pink rectangular flacon only hit the shelves eight years ago.

Bloom's fresh white floral opening delights with its dominant tuberose and crisp green facets, like crushed young stems. The waxy petals and green stems of jasmine soon become apparent, and are superbly blended with the tuberose. Both flowers are neither carnal nor indolic at arm's length; they are softly creamy and very fresh, with a splash of naturalistic sweetness. It's only up close that they have a bit more indolic bite, but you'd have to be very initimate for someone else to detect it.

Bloom becomes creamier and less sharp in the dry down, while remaining clean and bright. The shift is subtle, and overall the scent is fairly linear.

The comparisons to Diptyque's much pricier Do Son EAU DE TOILETTE are apt, but Bloom is arguably a better fragrance; more coherent, simpler, more persistent, and certainly more affordable. It may be more synthetic, but you couldn't tell due to its clever composition.

In fact, from among the wave of minimalist designer florals that descended on the market in 2017, Bloom is by far the most naturalistic, despite being predominately composed of synthetics. It is lighter and more cheerful than Twilly d'Hermès EAU DE PARFUM, which has a heavy-handed dose of musk in the base, and more distinctive than Gabrielle Chanel EAU DE PARFUM, which timidly mimicked the citrus and floral accord of Jour d'Hermès EAU DE PARFUM, released four year's earlier. Alberto Morillas really does know how to compose a blockbuster to a budget without sacrificing artistry, and Bloom is among his finest examples."
Bloom,06/08/2019,Rosaviola,F,180,,21,Modern Floral Fragrance,"I received Gucci Bloom as a Christmas gift in 2017 from my dear daughter.
I am actually always on the lookout for vintage fragrances, but I can't expect my family to gift me such scents. You have to know a bit about them, and they don't.
So, before Christmas, I always make a little list of fragrances, new releases, or classics that could be gifted to me.
And Bloom was certainly a good choice.
I perceive Bloom as a modern, soft, pleasant floral fragrance. It is modern in that the floral notes appear delicate and balanced. The flowers are present but not overwhelming.
In the past, it was different; floral scents often made you feel like you had your nose buried in a whole lush bouquet.
Here, you can certainly recognize the tuberose, which is soft and not too intense, and a bit of jasmine is balanced in its dosage.
I am not familiar with Rangoon Creeper, so I don't know how it smells and cannot judge how strongly it influences the scent. I had to Google it first.
It is also called ""Chinese honeysuckle"" and is a tropical climbing plant found in South and Southeast Asia.
Of course, it cannot be compared to the floral bombs from the eighties and nineties, but that's okay.
I think it is a beautiful, modern, delicate, contemporary floral fragrance. It could last a bit longer, but I am also too influenced by the eighties, where a fragrance easily lasted 10 hours without becoming too close to the skin. But nowadays, you have to be glad if a fragrance lasts 4 hours.
A good gift and one of the better new releases in recent years."
Bloom,01/16/2019,Seyda,F,15,,24,"I can hardly believe it,","that this fragrance is now one of my absolute favorites.

It all started about a year ago. I was newly pregnant and had received a sample.
“Brrrr, this is terrible, cloying, and just nooo,” was my first thought.
Time and again, that one spray would hit my nose, and I can tell you, I have never experienced a fragrance that made me feel genuinely sick. I mean really. Sure, there are many that aren't my style, but I never actually felt nauseous.

Well, as I said, I was in a different condition, and then the worst nausea really hit.

Mon Guerlain and this one managed to catapult my scent receptors straight out of the game. I knew Guerlain before my pregnancy and I really liked it, so much for that.

Unfortunately, I was constantly confronted with Gucci in the family, even if it was just subtly, it was dreadful, but the others can't help it :)

So, the pregnancy was over, and I started to get Bloom under my nose more often, and suddenly I was so in love. It was like a lightning bolt hit me, and I couldn't believe that I suddenly liked it so much. It now reminds me of my beloved Oilily that I owned in the 90s.

So I tried it again and walked through the city.
Yes, it's great, has enormous longevity, and a beautiful floral sillage.

To me, it simply smells creamy and beautifully floral. Additionally, very, very elegant. I don't find it powdery. Like a body lotion mixed with flowers and a bit grassy.
Here, it’s enough to spray 1-2 times; otherwise, it’s really too much. But that’s definitely sufficient.

Well, today I can hardly believe that this wonderful fragrance once made me feel so overwhelmed and what hormones can do to you :)

By the way, I still can't stand Mon Guerlain anymore, not at all; that love is definitely over :)"
Bloom,09/15/2017,pudelbonzo,F,2405,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,21,wild meadow,"Today my eyes were caught by a charming floral carton that one must stop for as a packaging victim.
Oh Gucci Bloom.

At the sight of the flowers, I thought of the folk song: We weave you the virgin's wreath - but the scent does not come across as innocent - virginal at all.

It is fresh green, as if just picked - but not girlishly playful.
But also not ladylike elegant.

It makes its own interesting statement, which is a bit untamed and pleasantly natural.
The enchanting chaos of a wildflower meadow, where everything still fits together.

The jasmine shines bright and clear, and the tuberose is intense - but not breathtaking.
A soft bitterness is added by the iris.

All the ingredients are dew-fresh - and still rooted in the earth.

Bloom has also taken root on my skin - and it lands without a doubt on the wish list."
Bloom,01/06/2018,3duard15,M,10,,13,Glazed Tuberose,"Gucci BLOOM is by far one of the best women's fragrances that hit the market in 2017. It reflects what Gucci stands for: luxury, elegance, and confidence, as this scent has, in contrast to appearances like BAMBOO, a wonderful quality.

Scent: Anyone who hates tuberose shouldn't even bother looking at it. Because it is very, very tuberose-heavy. But in addition to the wonderful composition of the flowers, the fragrance has a very creamy note. I can't quite describe it, but it's definitely not sweet. BLOOM smells, to put it briefly, of bright flowers, with a generous splash of tuberose surrounded by cream.

Longevity/Sillage: There's no comparison to lukewarm waters like BAMBOO. Finally, Gucci has raised the quality level. BLOOM lasts a good 9+ hours on the skin, and on clothing, probably for several days. The sillage is very noticeable, but one should definitely pay attention to the dosage as the environment may perceive the already pronounced tuberose scent as overwhelming.

Bottle: Extremely simple, which is not necessarily what one would expect from Gucci. Square shape in a soft, washed-out pink. The name of the house and the fragrance are affixed. The bottle also has a nice weight to it."
Bloom,02/04/2018,Rutil,F,37,,16,The Imaginary Garden,"Braided hair, softly flowing dresses, barefoot walking in lightness through a garden full of white flowers… yes, there are worse things in this world. As long as one is not averse to tuberose and does not disdain jasmine, one can share a joyful connection with this perfume. I must admit that I am not indifferent to some of Morillas' creations, and Bloom is no exception.
The division into top, heart, and base notes is unnecessary, as the perfume immediately unfolds completely with all its components. It opens with a fresh floral-creamy bouquet of tuberose and jasmine paired with Rangoon creeper; a color changer throughout its existence, as it initially blooms white and then gradually blushes from pink to dark red. According to Gucci's fragrance description, this Rangoon creeper is said to possess a slightly powdery and feminine scent note, adding richness to the creation. Due to my lack of a pure olfactory reference for this climbing plant, I would say this component supports the perfume as a whole and adds a touch of exclusivity due to its unusualness. The iris mentioned here is not perceptible to me, but rather a hint of musk in the background. Throughout the day, Bloom remains floral-creamy, but becomes more delicate and gently fades out after a long-lasting wear.
In summary, a lush blooming imaginary garden for the skin… simple and lush at the same time. Fine!"
Bloom,06/22/2018,MarieTheres,F,71,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Between too much and too little,"Summer in April - already in the first spring months, we were sweating at 30 degrees. And I chose Bloom as my first summer fragrance this year. Was this decision wise? No idea - but now at the end of June, it’s empty, and I want to write a few lines about it.

Actually, Bloom is not a prototypical candidate for summer; it’s far too heavy for that - autumn would suit it much better. The scent has a tropical-floral quality to it; the description says ""creamy,"" but I would not agree with that at all. The floral aspect is not fresh or classically refined in any way, but rather very muggy - wearing it feels a bit like being in a palm garden or greenhouse. That's almost too much in hot temperatures.

The bottle also appears very modern and, with its peachy pink, seems pastel-light - but that’s not Bloom at all. The bottle could have been much kitschier according to the scent it contains, something more 90s-style - but not so straightforward and clean. One associates the color with a fruity scent, which you certainly do not find in the bottle.

Right after spraying, Bloom is very strong, and you expect an impressive sillage and longevity - but in my opinion, there is too little of that. It smells briefly and intensely of the specified floral potpourri, but then dissipates within a few hours and is no longer perceptible in the evening. On the skin, it has completely vanished; on clothing, you might still catch a hint of it. That, in turn, is too weak for a designer fragrance.

Speaking of potpourri - do you know those dried plant parts that have been coated with a fragrance oil to scent the room...? Bloom reminds me of that. For me, this perfume is not a candidate for repurchase; its floral heaviness and green notes were just too much for me. I prefer flowers interpreted as fresh or sweet, perhaps with accents of vanilla or soft woods. This one simply has too much flower embedded in too little."
Bloom,08/27/2020,Laminatrix,F,78,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,17,"Vintage Flower Bomb, hell yeah!","First off: I love this scent. Even though various people (men) can't make me dislike it, as some of my buddies think it smells like grandma. Yet it is such a beautiful, purist floral masterpiece: Tuberose dominates and jasmine softens it into a floral-powdery-soft fragrance. I can't say much about the longevity, but I can say a lot about the effect:

This scent envelops you in a floral cloud that surrounds you all day long - without smelling outdated. You have to be careful with the dosage, because if you apply too much, you smell like a greenhouse.
The jasmine is not that harsh, hyper-dominant jasmine of an alien, but a softer, subtler one.

This makes this fragrance so unique, as it has an incredibly beautiful floral essence without becoming an overpowering bouquet. Bloom is puristic, modern, and at the same time has a lot of classic floral scents that stand out and perform really well, without reminding one of the bouquets from the fifties.

Gucci Bloom is something for individualists, as both wallflowers and women from the ""I’ll blow you away with my scent"" category will find it somewhat semi-appealing, since for some it is too dominant and for others too pure. I believe none of the fragrances in my collection is perceived as controversially by my surroundings. My colleagues find it quite cool, while others think it’s rather old-fashioned. I really like this controversy, because despite its enormous floral character, it is straightforward and not overly whimsical."
Bloom,10/05/2020,EdenRosalie,F,8,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,"Inconsistent, oppressive, heavy, almost penetrating","Dakota Johnson and the lush floral splendor on the poster surely contributed to my decision to purchase this fragrance. However, even after multiple applications, I am not sure what to make of it. Bloom, however, has less to do with the scent, rather it resembles a heavy bouquet used to spray dried flower arrangements.
Tuberose as a hint, but not in its pure, unadulterated form, rather distorted by overly soapy jasmine, which overshadows the perfume and makes the scent too heterogeneous to be well described. Humid and too heavy, with one particular note that bothers me reminding me of DIOR J'adore. Too inconsistent, too indecisive."

Bloom,03/10/2020,Marilyn25,F,48,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,In the Tropical Greenhouse in Sicily,"Today I want to write about Gucci Bloom, as I had the pleasure of receiving a sample through an online purchase. I didn't really like the flanker Gucci Bloom Nettare di Fiori; somehow it was too stuffy and too heavy for me. With Gucci Bloom, it's different. I feel immediately transported to a tropical greenhouse. There is jasmine in its purest form, there is tuberose, but it doesn't smell like Hypnotic Poison, rather creamy-soft, and there is something exotic that I can't quite place. Like exotic tropical flowers. The sun is shining. Insects are wandering. In the jungle, all sorts of strange plants are thriving that no human has ever seen before. In the shade lies a lethargic leopard, exuding majesty. This scent is creamy, floral, not too light, not too heavy, and feels very elegant. I imagine the wearer like this: no grass skirt, no coconut bikini top to further weave the tropical-exotic image from above, no. A dark-haired lady with an elegant chignon, wearing a white silk blouse and large white pearl earrings like the girl with the pearl earring by Vermeer. She sits on a terrace overlooking the sea in front of Sicily, sipping an espresso. This perfume definitely evokes associations of the (sub)tropics for me. Yet it is unmistakably European. (Some may disagree with me.) The sillage is strong. Gucci Bloom is definitely something for a lady, and I like it! I think it's a versatile perfume, suitable for a business meeting just as much as for dinner or the theater. Who would have thought that I would ever like a Gucci fragrance! Gucci Rush - too sweet, Gucci Bamboo - too boring, Envy Me - too unremarkable, and as I said, Gucci Bloom Nettare di Fiori - too heavy. And now this! I give Gucci Bloom a score of 7.5 points, as I am not a huge fan of tuberose."
Bloom,09/05/2021,DilaraErcan,F,3,,8,Bouquet in a Bottle,"When you wear this fragrance, you truly smell like real flowers.

Gucci Bloom - for me, an absolutely perfect fragrance!"
Bloom,12/31/2023,VerityChar,F,53,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Something is off here,"I used the sample that I was allowed to test back then simply as an air freshener in the bathroom. It didn't work as a perfume, something bothered me about it, even though the pyramid is exactly my style. I love jasmine, love tuberose, love musk, and here it didn't even come across as ""warm"" and sexy to me, but just flower, short and sweet. And I usually like flowers

After it was applied, I really missed the scent. It didn't even annoy me, like some of my fragrances that I prefer to smell.
At some point, a bigger AF will move in with me, I need to dissect this again to understand what ultimately won my heart.

The perfume is unique and easily recognizable, everywhere. It would definitely work as a signature scent. If someone can wear it, great, I would love to smell it, just not on me."
Bloom,02/13/2025,Lvoe,F,31,,10,How floral do you want to smell? - Yes!,"That I would ever write a review about this fragrance, I never thought I would in ten years. I have tested the scent countless times due to its beautiful packaging. Something about it bothers me extremely, so it wasn't worth another thought.

Until yesterday...

My colleague was standing next to me at the computer and showed me something, and suddenly this extremely delicious-smelling cloud of fragrance came towards me, it smelled like a fresh flower meadow. In spring, the birds are chirping, the first flowers are blooming, the grass is still slightly damp. The sun is shining.
Wow! I took another deep breath, is this a perfume? Is this a fabric softener? Or is this a hand cream? Should I ask her? Normally, I can recognize (almost) any perfume blindfolded...

When another cloud of fragrance hit my nose, I just had to ask her.

Before she pronounced the name, Gucci Bloom immediately came to my mind. But since when does it smell this incredibly good?

And of course, it was Gucci Bloom!

In our office, the whole hallway, everywhere she walked, it smelled wonderfully for hours afterwards. I don't mean in a cloying way like perfume. Not at all.
It just smelled really clean, well-groomed, anything but like perfume and cloying.
And that's why I suddenly love this scent so much; I can't stand fragrances that leave an extremely overpowering scent note throughout the house.

But back to the fragrance, how did I perceive it?
First of all, totally well-groomed, not intrusive at all. But somehow fresh, clean, spring-like.
The scent is very floral; to me, it smells somewhat cool and floral.
It definitely smells floral; anyone who can't handle that should definitely stay away from this fragrance.

It is also relatively monotonous; I find the progression quite boring, but that’s exactly what makes the scent somehow special.

This may not be the highlight of my fragrance collection, but I can already see myself strolling through the city in spring wearing a delicate summer dress with this scent.

My new clean girl scent!"

With a thorough warning that most of them weren't for her. Apparently, among her personal shelf warmers is also ""Gucci Bloom,"" which I daringly tested last weekend.

I had to hold on tightly to my makeup table - it nearly knocked me over. This perfume combines quite a bit that I don't like in a fragrance. Tuberose simply reminds me too much (and unpleasantly) of the Canasta afternoons in my great-aunt's living room, when I, as a young girl, was allowed to watch the sprightly ladies play cards.

So internally, I truly feel crushed on the floor, but in practice, I stand there with a juicy spritz of ""Gucci Bloom"" - and it refuses to leave me. The longevity was - to my dismay - really lasting.

I just can't get anything out of this scent; the musk in the base completely takes my breath away.

So today, I told my colleague about my fragrance clash with ""Gucci Bloom"" - she just laughed gleefully, as she had warned me..."
Bloom,05/29/2023,Pinkblossom1,F,4,,1,Long live love Alberto Morillas,"My second review... wow, I'm already at this point, moving on to another Gucci fragrance, my beloved GUCCI BLOOM.
Alberto Morillas has done EVERYTHING RIGHT with the Bloom line, specifically in my opinion with Gucci Bloom including Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori.

Floral, jasmine, white musk... everything comes to the forefront. The cologne-like super pleasant after smell is simply wonderful and gives the whole thing such a luxurious kick. It reminds me a bit of Chanel Mademoiselle _

I don't even want to talk about the longevity... the more positive version of a super clingy dude who doesn't care about anything ;)"
Bloom,11/16/2023,Mayderest,F,3,,2,Cheeky Flower,"--- This cheeky Bella has stolen the doll again! Like stung by a tarantula, Else dashes after the dog, across the gallery and down the stairs. The beech wood of the venerable staircase creaks in protest at each jump over such outrageous behavior. The dining room and the salon had just moments ago fallen into a contemplative midday slumber, allowing the spring sun to shine..."
Bloom,10/29/2017,Esterabrava,F,6,,4,The Bloom That Slept Through Summer and Awoke in Autumn,"Warm, soft, floral, slightly powdery. Too serious for spring, too fresh for autumn. In the context of climate change, the perfect scent for a mild autumn :)"
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,03/26/2024,Gourmandgrl,F,307,,4,Beautiful with the right skin chemistry,"This is so gorgeous straight out of the bottle - like a milky gardenia combined with a sugary amber musk.

Unfortunately on my skin, the pear blossom sticks out like a sore thumb and turns a bit salty (I have pretty acidic skin pH so I guess I'm not surprised by this) - which causes the fragrance to topple out of balance.

Try this - it's not boring like some have said; to me it's understated, classy, and beautiful if you have the right skin chemistry!"
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,04/06/2025,Ursaw,F,166,,2,"Underwhelming, juvenile and forgettable","Not the worst out of the Floras, but only because it's faceless. Smells sugary-sweet with an indistinct synthetic undertone. I didn't get much berries, and wasn't able to recognize any particular flowers. Everything except sugar was vague, more of a formality than anything else.

Fabric softener kind of smell, except fabric softener usually lingers longer. It took less than an hour for everything but the base to evaporate, and by the end of the second hour the base was gone as well.

For the money that it costs, this whole collection feels like one big scam to me tbh."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,05/14/2025,DogiCoco,F,637,,1,VLJ meets CCM,"I agree with everyone who thinks this smells pretty close to Viva La Juicy. Especially in the opening and heart phase, it's uncanny. Lively, fresh berries with a spritz of mandarin, clean gardenia, glossy light caramel (which is listed as brown sugar here, but smells more like a caramel hard candy). Very girly and easygoing. Ironically I find the original VLJ a bit more floral, but many of the flankers lean more into warmer gourmand territories, and Flora does, too.

At least for a while. In the drydown I can suddenly smell the Patchouli and jasmine, and together with the citrus sparkle of the top notes that still hang on, they remind me of a softer, sweeter Coco Mademoiselle. What a surprise! I like that this perfume is not quite as predictable as I thought, even though I seem to be the only one who gets this aspect of the scent.

In my opinion this would make a good everyday scent or even a gift for someone who likes perfumes, but isn't deep into the hobby. And of course also for someone who is and really likes fruity florals, or sometimes needs a break from the niche-y stuff. Just a pleasant, feminine scent, maybe a bit generic, but nicely done.

Kind of off-topic, but I have to get this off my chest: I really didn't like the frilly-frumpy-flowery aesthetic of Gucci under Alessandro Michele. Always a ruffle too much. It took me years to get used to the ""new"" Flora bottles and I still hope they will get another makeover."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,07/11/2025,Bistdumeine,F,10,,1,Pretty and adequate,"Non-specific fruit and floral float casually on a solid jasmin and sugar base. It certainly does not impress but it is pretty and playful, and there are days I wake up eager to put this on.
It definitely leans youthful but the jasmin really anchors this down in a way to avoid being ""juvenile"", even though the sugar really does push it this way.
It's very much a mini floral dress sort of perfume. It is fine enough. I also want to add that this has the best atomizer in my entire collection and allows me to spray exactly how little I want to spray."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,06/10/2025,VodkaSun,F,6,,1,"Nice floral perfume, but I don't get gardenia","This is a nice, mostly inoffensive perfume. Despite the name, I really don't get much gardenia.

I get an initial note of purply, berry, sweet tart like candy. Then it moves to a general floral. It's here that I'm surprised to not get gardenia. Or at least what I normally think of as gardenia. I don't know? Maybe I don't actually know what gardenia smells like? I get more of a violet, freesia like floral. Then it sort of melts into a caramely/amber/skin like scent.

Very mid in terms of how long it lasts. For me it doesn't seem to project very much, but I think of that as a good thing. It feels like it lasts for a decent amount of time but it only hangs in a fairly small bubble around me. For me, it's a safe for work perfume. I'd say it's a fairly safe blind buy - as long as you are generally ok with florals.

This isn't one that I'm going to buy a full bottle of or constantly reach for but it's nice. No complaints. I'll happily use up the sample size I have. There's just nothing super unique or interesting about it."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,04/22/2025,fatima60,F,9,,1,Not my cup of tea,"If you want to smell like that classic smell of ,,grandmas home'', go for it. I personally didn't really like it because it was just a bit to flourish and old smelling. It's a great mix of notes and definitely stays interesting, but honestly there's better alternatives for that. You will smell like a crazy garden for about 10 minutes, after that it's just granny coming out."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,08/10/2021,Franzibm,F,12,,9,Unexpected ..,"I have to admit, Gucci fragrances have never convinced me before. I am 25 years old and always found the scents to be more suited for ""mature"" women. I became aware of this perfume because of the incredibly beautiful bottle. My thought was, however, ""Oh, this probably won't be for me again."" Today I went to the perfume store and saw the bottle standing there. Pink, gold,..."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,01/16/2022,LenaMarie,F,31,,7,Flower Waters,"Hooked by the appealing advertising and the beautiful bottle, I set out to find a sample of this fragrance and soon succeeded. Right from the first spray, I noticed that Gucci Flora GG is also a victim of what I have dubbed the ""Müller phenomenon."" The first spray smells like the perfume department at Müller: alcoholic, piercing, floral-powdery, and undefined. Unfortunately, this happens to me with many designer fragrances. But it's not too bad, as this impression fades after a short time. However, unfortunately, this fragrance did not convince me further along. The name Flora is absolutely fitting; the scent is floral-sweet. It is also quite pleasant to wear. Unfortunately, I could hardly perceive any development of the fragrance. I could detect various notes (mandarin, jasmine, hardenberg, sugar), but that was about it. For me, Flora GG feels flat and does not differ from other standard floral fragrances. However, anyone looking for a pleasant, subtle sweet-floral scent won't go wrong."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,09/25/2021,JaMer,F,11,,4,Sugar Killer,"I must solemnly declare at this point that for the first time in my life, a perfume nearly knocked me out. And I mean that literally. Within seconds of applying it, I felt so nauseous that I thought I would faint immediately. Yes, I fled the perfume store to get some fresh air. As I sat on the train on my way home, the cloyingly sweet, berry-biting scent from my wrist wafted into my nose, and my head was buzzing. Yes, I got a headache like I had only ever experienced from one fragrance before: Burberry Her.
What a shame, because I really like the classic Gucci Flora and Gucci Bloom, but this one is concentrated cotton candy, ultra-sweet poison. Maybe it’s too strong, or maybe I’m just too weak...?"
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,12/21/2021,Guinevere,F,20,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Vintage & yet modern,"I really like the original EDT of Gorgeous Gardenia (GG) and since I can't get to the city at the moment, it had to be a blind purchase..... daring, but I often take such risks and it works out 95% of the time :-), here is my review:

The bottle: the 30ml bottle fits very well in the hand and has a certain weight (still okay for a handbag), it looks quite high-quality despite the sticker. The spray is great, it really sprays very fine, no dripping or running of the liquid. The bottle has a very nice vintage feel due to its design and fits the fragrance very well. A downside is that you can only guess the fill level by shaking it.

The scent: it reminds me of the GG EDT but is, in my opinion, greener and airier and less sweet. Based on the comments for the EDP, I would have expected a sugar bomb, but that is not the case at all. At times, it resembles the Gucci Bloom line more, but is less overpowering. The scent starts off fruity-herb-fresh for me, after about 5 minutes, slightly creamy flowers come through, while this heart note remains subtly underlaid by a delicate green ""cut flower note"" for a long time. Only in the base, after about 1.5-2 hours, a soft floral sweetness comes into play, but everything is very moderate and pleasant, the green note remains just a whisper. The scent never becomes stuffy, too sweet, or cloying. The GG EDP feels modern, fresh, cheerful, and has a vintage vibe without being ""old.""

The sillage and longevity: as beautiful as the scent is, it could use more sillage and also more longevity. Maybe it's also due to the current temperatures and it will come out stronger in spring/summer? I will know in a few months.

The price-performance ratio: it doesn't quite fit for me, meaning it's too expensive for the rather low sillage and longevity, good that there are offers .-)

The campaign: at first, I wondered why Miley Cyrus, I would rather see her with Libre, BO, or something similar, but somehow she fits... I recently read that she embodies self-expression, authenticity, and optimism, being a free spirit of her generation, and that is what the fragrance is supposed to convey. Well, I would expect a scent with more edge or punch from free spirits, but when viewed from the vintage side, it somehow fits. Unfortunately, I can't find the right words to really describe what I mean (if I do, I will edit my contribution). By the way, the older ""free spirits"" (and also ""non-free spirits"") can definitely wear the scent just as well ;-)

My conclusion: I find GG EDP to be a great fragrance for all ages, but it unfortunately lacks a bit in sillage and longevity. It definitely brings a bit of optimism and ""free spirit"" into the currently rather difficult and serious times."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,11/04/2021,LaCarlotta,F,3,,3,Sugar Bomb & Copy Cat,"Rarely have I encountered a scent that is too sweet; most of them make the alcohol bite your nose first. Here, however, there’s a hit from the sugar claw right away. Do you know that feeling when you want to adjust the colors on your TV screen and suddenly the colors are so garish, as if you’ve bitten into the wrong mushroom? That’s how Gucci Flora smells... completely overdriven. Floral is only in the name here. Olfactorily, it reminds me of an overly sweet cocktail that has been sweetened not with sugar but with stevia and corn syrup.

On the second sniff, we notice two scent twins: https://www.parfumo.de/Parfums/Hunkemoeller/Noir The teen perfume from the grab-and-go shelf and https://www.parfumo.de/Parfums/American_Eagle/Vintage_for_Her_Eau_De_Toilette from the fashion label in the USA - both fit in well there. For a premium luxury brand like Gucci, however, this is an absolute failure."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,06/21/2023,pudelbonzo,F,2405,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Also suitable for summer,"After I sprayed Gorgeous Jasmine yesterday, I had to realize that its scent fullness was not suitable for the heat.
However, I like to wear it in moderate temperatures.
So today I cautiously approached Gorgeous Gardenia.
The scent fullness is also present here, but the gardenia is gentler than the jasmine.
It is also not a directly subtle fragrance, but it feels lighter than the jasmine.
The aquatic mandarin keeps the scent flowing, so the flowers seem to flow past like on a clear stream.
Jasmine is also present - but here the more subtle gardenia takes center stage.
One spray is enough even in these hot temperatures.
It's also a beautiful floral scent, which will probably only come into its own in the fall.
I have also moved my jasmine into the fall lineup."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,04/27/2022,Duftor,M,26,,7,You can't go wrong with this scent!,"A review from a man's perspective :D

I bought Flora Gucci as a gift after a long consideration and some testing in the store, and since it was still new.
The bottle is beautiful, presented in floral pink and gold with lovely edges, really well done.
When sprayed, lovely floral accents emerge that become even sweeter, as if you were standing in a field. I characterize a self-confident woman with this perfume, and it is very pleasant to my nose. It is not bitter, it is not too sweet, and it is not overly extravagant but rather remains subtle yet beautifully floral.

I find Flora Gorgeous Gardenia absolutely great; I can only recommend it to anyone looking for a gift, as you really can't go wrong. The joy was also quite large, and as I said, a very pleasant scent."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,07/07/2023,Insanna,F,2,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Absolute Favorite in Summer,"I fell in love with this perfume immediately. I first received it as a sample and tested it right away. The scent is very unusual, floral-citrusy, very fresh and invigorating, but also slightly sweet and light. Later, before I bought it, I wanted to test it again in the store and it was a WOW effect! You can definitely wear this perfume in summer and also in early autumn...."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,04/15/2024,Berni007,F,54,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,A Touch of Lightness,"This fragrance has such a lightness! This freshness, these subtle floral notes, and this slight sweetness are simply beautiful. I find that it also has a very light fruity aspect, but only minimal. No matter where you go, you won't bother anyone. I don't know anyone who doesn't like the scent. I often wore it in the summer at the office. Yes, the longevity unfortunately..."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,03/24/2025,MajaDuft,F,105,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Fruity Floral Good for Spring,"I own the pink Flora Gorgeous Gardenia EAU DE PARFUM along with the yellow and purple ones.
I treated myself to the first scent because I really liked the packaging and the campaign.
Those expecting pure flowers from Flora will be disappointed, as there are additional notes at play, specifically fruity ones like Andean berries and mandarins that can be detected in the top notes.
In the base, brown sugar and patchouli come into play; I find the sugar interesting as it refines the scent with a sweetness.
Overall, the pink Gucci Flora is an average scent that is well-suited for spring, but personally, it doesn't blow me away, as I have many fragrances and have been able to test quite a few.
However, everyone has their own taste; unfortunately, I find the longevity of the Flora scents to be rather underwhelming, which is a shame because for the price, one could expect more.
Nevertheless, I am happy to have it in my collection, although it is not worn often."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,09/24/2022,Alinee,F,7,,5,Standard Spring / Autumn,"It smells like a synthetic old flower shop. Slightly headache-inducing upon application, but not noticeable throughout the day. It is definitely not a striking perfume or a compliment magnet. It works well for spring or autumn. It is light, but the synthetic note makes it feel a bit heavier, so it's rather not suitable for summer."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,03/29/2024,Parmesan1954,F,23,,5,Fruity Variety,"Incredibly charming composition that reminds one of sweet sparkling pear. Ripe pear and whipped cream sprinkled with brown sugar. It reminds me of apples, cherries, plums. It feels as if the perfume swirls in the wind like rose petals. This fragrance is for true ladies. Aristocratic, intelligent, and graceful. Moreover, the bottle is a real eye-catcher. Beautiful, colorful,..."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,05/28/2023,Pinkblossom1,F,4,,3,I found my love in Portofino,"My very first review (don't judge) after it was recommended to me by a loyal user who I consider a perfume expert, has to go to Gucci Flora.
A very beautiful spring scent aside from the gorgeous design. Floral... garden-like jasmine... somewhere a few berries pop out, so a bit fruity, but the floral notes dominate!
During the day, the floral scent can fade a bit and the sweetness stands out.

It's not the longest-lasting fragrance of all time, but it fits perfectly because I find it sufficient for use on important occasions outdoors on a beautiful sunny day, but watch the dosage (aside from the price if you are not completely independent yet ahaha;) )! It could make you feel a bit nauseous without joking, but that's the typical Gucci strength, so it hits ahahha.

It reminds me of Portofino... even though I've never been there, that's why I wear it rarely or not at all... so I don't fall too much into my Italy dreams...

Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,11/26/2024,ComputerMaus,M,264,,3,Fruit and Flower,"Thinking of a pure floral scent, Flora Gorgeous Gardenia EAU DE PARFUM delights me with a very tasty fruit opening. The berries are not well defined, but their character is noticeable and pleasing. After a few minutes, the fragrance becomes floral-fruity and is very sweet. And from here, it starts to become increasingly ordinary.

As it develops further, floral and fruity notes blend together, forming a relatively sweet homogeneous mixture that is widespread in women's fragrances. Good for everyday wear and leisure, certainly not a bad date scent in sunny weather. But it's a bit frustrating considering it promised so much more in its first hour.
Nevertheless, it's a fragrance that, thanks to its lightness, exudes a lovely, youthful carefreeness that brings a bit of joy.
It also has a good sillage that lasts a nice 3 hours. Surprisingly, it only takes another hour for the scent to shrink down to skin level. For that, I find the price too high.

What I really can't stand is the kitschy bottle."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,06/16/2023,Anniiiii,F,5,,2,When the Flower Meadow Disappears,"On the bottle, for me, a beautiful, intense summer fragrance, full of colorful flowers and joy of life. I couldn't help but spray it on, but it took less than a minute for the colorful flower meadow to vanish and be covered by a huge cotton candy cloud. Where did the flowers go all of a sudden? Where was summer? All this thinking gave me a headache, and I desperately tried to wash the scent off my skin."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,09/10/2025,Kerkyra74,F,669,,3,The Maid Has Been Here,"....phew, where do I start...it smells to me like the time when I used to vacation in those all-inclusive resorts and the maid, oh no, I mean room service, had just been there. The floors are freshly mopped, the beds newly made, a flower arrangement on the bed. Well, a clean scent in the sense that I wanted to make the room romantic for the couple and sprayed a bit (generously) floral room fragrance note Flowerpower Bubblegum Strawberry. Well, you breathe in, you breathe out, it’s annoying and personally takes away a bit of my air...similar to Prada Paradoxe intense. The bottles are really nice to look at, I only own the yellow flanker from this line...I believe it was Gorgeous Orchid...yes, if I take another deep breath before going to sleep, it has a bit of fabric softener jasmine for me..."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,07/14/2025,Steffi1701,F,2,,2,"Absolute all-rounder, my favorite scent","Not without reason have I used this fragrance up twice already. It is so beautifully fruity sweet and not at all intrusive. A very elegant sweetness from flowers, slightly powdery and absolutely perfect for every day. When I had the tester in my hand, it was already over for me. I can only recommend it to anyone who prefers sweet but not overpowering scents."
Rush,07/27/2012,Littlered,F,12,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Hot and bothered,"I am hopelessly in lust with Gucci Rush. It really stands apart from other fragrances. It is not trying to be something else.
The sweet, fruity candy powder and flowers melt together, and pack the first punch. Then they effortlessly give way to the hazy patchouli to create a sugary, spicy drydown.
It is totally carnal and provocative - no soft innocence here. Spicy, sensual, hot and ready, daring, unique, in-your-face, unapologetic.
You will either be completely, utterly taken...or not. It is worth finding out!"
Rush,07/15/2012,jtd,M,484,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,"Meandering anthropomorphizing of a perfume. Great perfume, though.","There’s nothing I can add to the comments I’ve read about how this smells. Hairspray, lactones, patchouli, non-existent flowers, bubblegum, poppers. All true.

It’s the feeling, though. There’s not even an attempt to tether this thing to anything actually botanical. Natural and chemical are words I tend not to use, because what do they mean? Nature, as we use it discussing the environment, has no meaning whatsoever when you look at it. And what matter isn’t chemical? That said, Rush’s value is that it is unnatural and chemical. And altogether unapologetic. And all the better for it.

If this is a signature scent, I pity the people close to the wearer. This is definitively an occasional scent. It is loud, cruisy, intolerant and laughs incessantly. This is the Dionysus of perfume. It’s also monotonous, not in the sense of humdrum, but of hitting one note, and one note only, endlessly. There is very little evolution in time with this one, but why should it be otherwise? Who wants a party to end? All credit to Tania Sanchez for describing this as both large-scale outdoor art and intended for a night out. That’s the best characterization I can imagine for this baby. Ultimately, though, the night-on–the-town analogy gives with one hand and takes with the other. Yes, Rush is the life of the party. Absolutely. We’re all drawn to her when she arrives. But she’s also the sitter. The last one at the party, dancing drink-in-hand by herself while everyone else has left.

Wonderful."
Rush,10/15/2023,MrsGuerlain,F,548,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Way too much in just the right amount,"First encounter: my nose was blown to pieces, not knowing what was up, down or day of the week. A screaming freesia and peach combo smashed into my face and for a few minutes I was unable to smell anything else. But the bulldozer patchouli made me smell again - only just patchouli. A very close friend had given me this as a gift, no specific occasion, and I sprayed it to show that I appreciated the thought. There was no way I could regret it. I had to wear it off. I smiled and said thanks.
For a long time it stood in the closet. Occasionally, I grabbed it to make sure that it was the same experience, and for a long time it was. But then something changed…
One summer day I sat next to a friend and noticed a lovely smell. I had to ask and she told me it was Gucci Rush. I was confused. What was happening? Later when I came back home I tried it again. And it was great. Still overwhelming and hefty but also nice and romantic (?)
I do not know what has happened but today I like Rush, even though I do not wear it often. I will describe the scent as ‘fun’. And it is great to have fun sometimes.

Rush,06/05/2020,Lgsoltek,M,8,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Kitsch chypre,"The first time I smelled this was at an Osmothèque conference on 100 years of chypre. Rush was chosen and presented by Christophe Laudamiel as one of the iconic chypres. At the time I hated it. What the hell is this weird plastic thing?
Now I understand it. If Mitsouko is Ingres’ Grande Odalisque, then Rush is Martial Raysse’s Made in Japan version of it. It's deliberately kitsch, blatantly synthetic, plasticky, shouty, industrial. Just as Martial Raysse said, beauty is bad taste, and bad taste is the dream of an over-desired beauty. Seen in this way, Gucci Rush fits perfectly into the pop art aesthetic. No need to be so serious all the time. Sometimes we just need a bit cheap trashy fun."
Rush,01/09/2012,PBullFriend,F,310,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,fruity vomit,"Certain perfumes bring a mental image to mind. The image Rush brings to my mind: a pale 20-ish woman with greasy dark hair curled away from her face (Farrah Fawcett-style), smelling of cigarette smoke and vomited fruity drinks, wearing jeans she has to lie down to zip, talking too loudly in the parking lot of a dance club because she's drunk and can't tell how loud she is. If I had to work next to someone who wore this, I'd consider paying them to wear something else. When I have a sample of a fragrance, I always try it at least twice on different days, but I couldn't bear a second try on this one. (050609)"

Fizzy, milky, powdery-woody and plastic, there is plenty for the nose to latch on to, as well as coriander, white flowers and patchouli. I say milky 'texture' but it’s better to call it milky hued; pale and lactonic. Rush has an alien feel, like Feu d’Issey (1998), and -..."
Rush,06/12/2023,Stacia,F,134,,6,Nothing else quite like it,"When I first whiffed this stuff I hated it. But then.. I kept coming back. There was something so in your face about it that turned me off initially. Then I realized where Gucci Rush fits in to the scheme of the world and its beauty became shiningly apparent. Can we talk about the bottle design for a minute? It looks like a VHS tape. That's perfect because this smells like the late 80s. It's hairspray and shoulder pads, acrylic hot pink nails and blue eyeshadow. This is how porn stars smell when they get all glammed up for a big shoot. Notes wise, it has all kinds of things going on at once. High volume florals, sweet vanilla, earthy patchouli, fruity peach. It's a hot mess but it somehow works! It is certainly meant only for wear at night, in a busy club or smoky bar. The synthetic smell is unnoticeable in these environments. I might sound like I dislike it, but it's quite the opposite. I LOVE THIS. It's a stand up and take notice smell. Big and loud with huge hoop earrings this scent is. She is a fashionista and her friends copy her style. Everything about this says big hair and gooey lipstick. But the world needs that! How can we appreciate that which is simple and refined if we do not occasionally experience a crude excess? Gucci Rush is the olfactory illustration of this concept."
Rush,05/03/2014,Omni,F,71,,4,Niche cellophane,"It has a presence around the shops at this time of year; Mother's Day next weekend. On me it smells like unwrapping an Apple Computer, niche cellophane. Sorry, no love towards it."
Rush,03/31/2025,HappyMilf,F,34,,4,"Sweet, synthetic, plastic, bold","The smell of a baby doll toy would be how i describe the scent in modern times. Sweet floral - would be my answer 20 years ago.

Gucci Rush is a millennial mother who gave birth to gen Z Amouage Guidance daughter.

I thought it was long discontinued, but after learning it was still produced, I had to re-purchased it for the nostalgia sake, after, what, 20 years? I didn't even test it at the store, just decided to go off the memories of the scent.

The scent brings a picture of a black winter leather jacket with fox fur trimmed sleeves and hood. The kind i couldn't afford at the time, but all the it girls seem to have. Just clarifying, it's not the description of the notes, its the memory that is revived by this perfume.

Can we please talk about the bottle design? I would really like to hear the story behind it. What motivated this unique, kitschy style? The funny thing about it is, I remember 20 years ago, it didn't strike me as something weird and original. I just took it for what it is, and if i remember correctly, it felt quite normal. How different it's perceived today in 2025!"
Rush,01/11/2025,Raluko111,F,418,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Long Live the Plastic Peach!,"The first time I met Gucci Rush was in my last year at university. I remember the girls wearing it, Friday nights at the mirror in the shared bathroom doing their make-up, and the last part of this ritual was imbibing their white bodysuits with Gucci Rush. I've always been attracted to its synthetic sweetness, but somehow, in those days, I wasn't the mini-skirt + high-heels type of girl.

The Rush reincarnation that I own now isn't the same scent-bomb like the Rush of those days. The newest version has been domesticated, but it still lasts and projects decently. It's a classic and modern perfume at the same time. The peach seems to have been made from plastic, and this is how I imagine those robots from Westworld smell: strange yet familiar, odd and attractive. It's a pretty interesting and nostalgic scent.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prima data cand am făcut cunoștința lui Gucci Rush a fost chiar in ultimul an de facultate. Tin minte fetele care il purtau, vineri seara, in baia comuna de la cămin, toate se machiau la oglinda si povesteau, iar ultima parte din ritual era îmbibarea maieurilor albe, mulate pe corp cu acest parfum. Întotdeauna am fost atrasa de dulceața lui artificiala si fireasca in același timp, dar cumva, pe vremurile acelea eram prea sfioasa ca sa mi-l cumpăr. Cumva nu eram eu tipa aceea cu fuste mini si tocuri si atitudine: nu ne prea potriveam.

Reincarnarea care o port acum nu mai e aceeași bomba îndrăcită ca Rush-ul de atunci. Versiunea recenta a fost îmblânzită, dar totuși are o persistenta si siaj destul de decente. Este un parfum clasic si modern in același timp. Piersica parca e făcută din plastic, ca si cum robotii din Westworld, pielea lor artificiala, ar mirosi așa: străin si familiar, straniu si atractiv deodată. Este unul dintre cele mai interesante parfumuri pe care le-am încercat si nimic nu se compara."
Rush,01/26/2012,Missk,F,1357,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,As tacky as the bottle it comes in,"Bizarre is the first word that comes to mind when describing Gucci Rush.

I'm actually quite familiar with this fragrance, my childhood dance teacher used to wear it as her signature. To me, Rush conjures up memories from the past. It's the smell of lipstick, hairspray, various cosmetics and hair curlers.

Gucci Rush does however smells wonderful on smokers. The smokey tobacco tends to blend wonderfully with the plasticky, peachiness that is Gucci Rush.

However, without the tobacco, this fragrance is a nightmare. Oddly enough I find that if I continue to smell Rush I start liking it as my nose becomes accustomed to its unique smell, however if I leave it for 30 minutes and then go back to it, I'm back to disliking the scent.

It's either a love it or hate it. I personally dislike the tackyness of the packaging and the cheapness of the fragrance itself. I'm usually pretty open-minded with unique fragrances, but in this particular case I am not.

This is what I'd describe as being the smell of melted lipstick meets tomato sauce. Odd, loud and nauseating, it seems to last a lifetime on my skin. Even harsh scrubbing can't kill this fragrance or help regain my sense of smell."
Rush,05/10/2012,Sherapop,F,1240,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Neither Compelling Nor Abhorrent,"My initial impression of Gucci RUSH was of an oriental vanilla perfume. Completely innocuous and likeable. The patchouli creeps in slowly and does not seem too loud at all to me (as some reviewers have complained...). But perhaps my patchouli receptors were permanently paralyzed during my testing of ANGEL. In any case, I am surprised by the polarized reviews of this..."
Rush,11/26/2024,Xavica,F,311,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Simply bold,"Gucci Rush is a perfume with great staying power and sillage, not for the faint-hearted!

It smells mainly of wood, flowers, peach and especially coriander which makes it spicy and gives it a ""sparkling"" and ""punchy"" effect.

I find it quite sexy, and even after all those years, I still like it. A perfume that doesn't leave indifferent."
Rush,01/05/2012,Jubliant,F,70,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,pixi sticks,"This smells like Fun Dip or PixiStix.
This is a cool powder being both sweet AND tart at the same time.
It is fairly linear and reminds me of My Insolence.
It's a manic depressive frag and I would like to eventually buy a small bottle"
Rush,04/29/2025,9AE,F,6,,3,First perfume to make me chuckle out of complete awe,"Wow, seriously, where do I even begin? What a journey this fragrance is, immediately! No need to let the notes settle down at all, you're immediately led into a smoke-filled basement club rave with cigarettes, perfumes, ecstasy, alcohol-breath and happy, flirty party people. Wow, this truly is the 90s in a bottle that I remember, right before cigarettes were banned in public and authentic smartphone-free 90s techno raves became nothing but a blast from the past."
Rush,07/11/2025,Elina2150,F,20,,2,Such happy reunion,"I was delighted to find out that Rush is back in the market as I thought it was discontinued and I couldn’t find it anywhere few years ago.

This is truly the scent of early 00’s but a really good one. It is quite chemical but at the same time very addictive, it’s something you have never smelled before and never will again.

For me it still smells the same as 25 years ago, maybe it’s nostalgia or maybe it’s just that it is a good perfume. I only wish Rush 2 would come back to market as well, as I thoroughly enjoyed it and it was my signature scent alongside of Envy Me, from early twenties to mid thirties. I would still purchase both of them if they were available."
Rush,06/28/2025,f1nn77777,M,13,,1,a smooth mix of floral notes,"I’m am doing a review of the classic formula of Rush. I haven’t tried the newer bottles, but it may have been reformulated. I’m not sure, but just a head’s up if you’re considering this scent.

The opening of Gucci Rush is a smooth mix of floral notes and what smells like peach (though, I’m not sure this is even an ingredient since I cannot find it listed). I would say the floral aspect at the start is more dominated by the rose note and the gardenia.

Add to that is the familiar scent of patchouli, which is well blended in Rush, and never goes overboard in my mind.

Most of what you’re going to get from this one will from the peach, patchouli, and gardenia. It’s floral/fruity with a bit of a dirty side to it.

This scent just sort of grabs your attention from the get go and feels so perfectly smooth as a floral based scent and not overly ‘green’ or like you’re walking through a garden.

It has a certain energy and seductive quality to it, which I suppose is where the Rush moniker came from.

At it’s heart, Rush is a sweet perfume but once again it stays grounded by the vetiver and patchouli notes which give it an earthy/woodsy quality. Some spicy kick floating in the background, but nothing too intense."
Rush,04/16/2021,Marieposa,F,90,,54,Come on Barbie let’s go party!,"I used to love going to Bootie Mashup parties. Following the motto ""We ruin your favorite songs,"" the big names in the scene like Dj Lobsterdust, TitusJones, and many others mercilessly mix EVERYTHING that the world of music has to offer. Pirate-pop icons like ""Knock out Eileen"" are still a favorite of mine to sneak into every playlist, and I would still roll up in the company parking lot with PartyBen's ""Galvanize the Empire"" if I hadn't gone independent years ago.
Sure, the results are musically convincing sometimes more and sometimes less, but the parties are a blast and the music is very danceable. Where so many rhythms collide, your own wiggling has to fit in somewhere.

Just like a really well-made bootleg, Gucci Rush mixes elements from well-known fragrances without regard for losses: there's the peach from Mitsouko - hardly recognizable under the thumping bass -, the smoky purring vetiver-vanilla from Habanita, and the patchouli-hedione backbone of Diorella. All of this has been shaken up with an overdose of milky-fruity lactones in a joyfully bubbling chemical cocktail, where probably no one can say anymore what originally belonged where. What emerges is a completely far-out, but extremely cheerful neo-chypre, and I strongly doubt that any of the ingredients ever grew on a plant. To me, the result smells more like a random byproduct from Walter White's trailer.
However, Rush doesn't get you high, but it does make you happy. At least me.

Spinning around on the vibrating dance floor, I sing along to snippets of songs I didn't even know I knew. Neon colors glow in the black light, swirling with me, faster and faster. Accidentally, I bump into another dancer while giggling and disappear to the bar before he can misunderstand my attack. Instead of the requested gin and tonic, the bartender sets down a glass with a bluish fluorescent liquid in front of me, grinning devilishly. I don't care! Boldly, I take a sip - and lo and behold, it tastes delicious. Just the right thing at this moment.
At some point, I find myself barefoot outside the club. I disposed of my trampled shoes in the trash can around the corner. The music pulses in my blood and the bass still thunders in my ears. The cold night air prickles on my skin as I wait for my taxi.
Tomorrow, I will be a sensible and responsible adult again. Then I'll wear Chanel or Guerlain, because I really have enough scents for the library, the theater, or a nice dinner in my perfume cabinet. Rush is certainly not the prettiest or smartest of my olfactory friends, but she's the one I love to dance with the most. She has a big mouth, but her heart is in the right place, and I don't know anyone who can laugh so heartily at herself as she can.
I don't really believe that my little (ugly!) red plastic bottle will ever be empty. But you never know..."
Rush,12/28/2018,Rosaviola,F,180,,25,The Red Lego Brick of the Child Woman,"I got to know Rush through the comments here and got myself a leftover bottle (as so often..).
That was about three years ago now. I often take a long time to get to know a fragrance before I write a comment.
Rush is still in my collection, still the same bottle.
The bottle itself is bright red and rather ugly, but very handy, fitting even in the tightest, overcrowded perfume cabinet and definitely has recognition value.
It also creates a certain contrast - the hard, unplayful bottle to the feminine scent.

Rush is, as mentioned, a very feminine fragrance. A bright floral scent with a bit of fruit, but never too sweet.
This femininity corresponds more to that of a young woman, lolita-like, doe-eyed, delicate. A woman, delicate with an innocent gaze, who attracts men with her big eyes and apparent fragility, awakening their protective instinct. It would have suited Kate Moss in the nineties perfectly.

Rush has a bright, floral scent character, innocent yet erotic.
I perceive the top notes most strongly with the bright freesia, gardenia, and a hint of peach. Following that, a bit of jasmine can be recognized along with a touch of fresh rose and a slight apple note behind it. Overall, it never becomes too sweet or too fruity. I can't directly identify coriander here; it may provide a slight, gentle spiciness, just a breeze.

Rush should not be over-applied, as it can easily come off as artificial. When applied subtly, it feels really nice on me. All in all, Rush is a well-crafted fragrance that older women can wear too - you don't have to be a Lolita to enjoy it! I'm considering getting another bottle of it."
Rush,01/20/2018,Leonora82,F,12,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,20,Dirty Talk or just Gucci Rush after all...,"For a long time, I resisted buying this fragrance. I know it from the past and I really don’t like the smell. Too spicy, too harsh, not sweet enough. About 2 years ago, I finally dared to order the fragrance ""blind."" Why? Simply in the hope that I would like the scent better at a slightly more mature age. I have always been a bit disappointed with the bottle. Okay, it is special and unique. But too angular, too plastic-like, and too synthetic for my taste. Still, it is different from other bottles. And so is the scent; different from other fragrances. When I wear Gucci Rush, my friends immediately assume that I am ""on the hunt."" We once had fun ""studying"" the effects of Gucci Rush. When I spray Gucci Rush, this scent clings to me like a magnet. Men (and some women too) hang around and often whisper some indecent things in my ear. When I wear a different fragrance, I do get approached, but usually less indecently. I asked my friends if I had ""write me!"" somewhere when wearing Gucci Rush. That is not the case! It seems that for some men, certain synapses are indeed activated... Synapses that lead to Dirty Talk. I mean, I have nothing against dirty thoughts, but I don’t want every third person whispering all their fantasies in my ear. I’m not a therapist for ""horniness"" ;). I still love the scent. Of course, also to play a little, but mainly because I simply love the fragrance. When sprayed, Gucci Rush starts off very floral and I perceive peach. Sweet, delicious peach. After a while, coriander clearly comes into play, making the scent very spicy. But I totally love this composition. Hated in the past, loved today. Over time, patchouli and vanilla join in. The scent is still sweet, but also fruity and spicy. And from this point on, the synapses are engaged. An irresistible fragrance that makes some people turn around and ask questions. The sillage is perfect. A bit intense, but bearable. Not overwhelmingly filling the room, which is totally positive. The scent lasts easily over 8 hours. It also survives hot nights and keeps the synapses busy. You can still smell the fragrance on clothes after wearing it, which I love. And all of this from an Eau de Toilette! Someone should try to replicate that. Gucci Rush will not leave my collection!"
Rush,03/12/2023,Moonchild,F,12,,43,Sexy Beast - I Love You!,"There are few fragrances that are as unmistakable, sexy, and at the same time somewhat strange to me. Rush is not one of those generic scents that get lost in the sea of successful fragrances. It is simply distinctive. I love how it envelops me and how it radiates. It is sweet, animalistic, fresh, while also being synthetic, and one should be careful not to overdo it. It definitely packs a punch. When I smell it, night falls. I see the lights of the big city. I taste beer, Vodka Red Bull, strawberry liqueur. I hear live music; rockabilly, punk rock, stoner rock, and I see hardcore shows (that’s music too ;-)). I think of the Röhren in Stuttgart, of the Submission with several floors. I set my alarm for 10 PM to get ready for the party. I remember pre-gaming with girlfriends and the hope of meeting certain guys at concerts or parties. I recall loud, wild driving music, incredibly good and terribly bad bands, sweaty crowds, sticky concert and club floors from beer, and foggy, smoky concert halls.
Furthermore, I remember the annoying birds that wouldn’t let me sleep in the early morning hours. And the Sunday morning that didn’t start until 2 PM - at the earliest. Rush accompanied me until that point and only disappeared after showering, when the hair lost the smell of smoke from washing and the remaining makeup was rinsed away. Yes, and today I sit on Sunday at 9 AM, well-rested after breakfast, still with a cup of coffee at the table, writing this and reminiscing about old times. Thanks to a spritz of Gucci Rush on my wrist. And I look forward to the next night out with a concert and girlfriends next weekend. Less wild, less long but still nice and surely accompanied by 3 spritzes of Gucci Rush."

Rush,02/21/2021,Christacita,F,60,,21,California Rush in 1999,"I have a nostalgic story connected to Gucci Rush. Let me take you back to San Diego in 1999. I had had enough of the dreary life in Switzerland and decided to travel to California for six months. So I did. Besides unforgettable experiences with a Chevy convertible on California's famous highways and wild city trips to Las Vegas and Los Angeles, I also attended a language school in downtown San Diego. The body culture had me firmly in its grip, so in addition to romantic beach volleyball sessions at the beach, I even toiled away at the gym during the day. While intensely chatting with my charming Frenchman from Paris on the cross-trainer, I flipped through Vogue magazine and discovered a fragrance sample of Gucci Rush. Once I smelled it, I was done for. I had fallen head over heels in love with the peach-freesia bouquet topped with coriander-vanilla. At the next Macy's, I quickly treated myself to the simple red plastic bottle, which was far too expensive for my standards at the time. To this day, I still don't know whether it was the influence of the coriander or the Frenchman that drove me nearly out of my mind. Regardless, this bottle has since become an essential part of my perfume collection. After all, no one wants to miss out on California feelings and French kisses from 1999. Especially not when the Backstreet Boys are crooning their hit ""I Want It That Way"" from their album Millennium..."
Rush,02/03/2018,Paris91,F,91,,6,Spiciness in Red Plastic,"Through all the comments, Gucci Rush piqued my interest. I knew this perfume, but I had never tested it. On one hand because of the ugly bottle, on the other hand because I'm not a fan of Gucci fragrances..

Today was the day. I wanted to test it.

I have to agree with the others. Yes, it is really special and I think that's a good thing!

Gucci Rush starts off directly floral sweet. I can't recognize the peach as such, just a pleasantly fruity sweetness mixed with the floral freshness of the freesia.
Jasmine follows right after and lingers relatively long. This makes the scent lightly honey-sweet and exotic. The coriander is also exotic. To be honest, that was what I feared the most. Coriander in a perfume? No, I associate coriander with Asian cuisine (not negatively, I like coriander). But I have to say, yes, that might make the scent so special and gives it this incomparable spiciness.
In combination, the fragrance is really great. Despite being an Eau de Toilette, the sillage is simply insane. The scent has been clinging to my wrist for 9 hours and keeps coming back to my nose...

One thing I must criticize though.. Unfortunately, Gucci Rush doesn't smell as great on me towards the end as it does in the heart note. Unfortunately, no vanilla and patchouli in sight (maybe it’s also due to my skin). Towards the end, it has a slight ""cleaning note."" It smells like a perfumed bathroom cleaner or something similar. I can't describe it well... But this smell then dampened my enthusiasm and kept me from purchasing it. Because if it weren't for this peculiar note, I would have definitely bought it. I have enough fragrances, but this one is quite special and so beautiful and timeless at the beginning..

Maybe it’s better this way, because I actually have enough perfumes and my boyfriend (whom I never listen to regarding fragrances) said that the bottle looks like a cassette recorder ;D

To all lovers: It's on sale in turquoise, so grab it ;) I wouldn't be surprised if it gets discontinued soon :("
Rush,02/11/2012,DrPablo,M,55,,14,this should appeal to the XTC generation,"Also such a strange thing. When I have Rush, it feels different....
It is based on a patchouli/vanillin/undecalactone accord. But once this combo of patchouli/lactone has gripped the brain like an old rag, it’s unfortunately over. A fitting description I once read is also: ""smells like teenage bad breath""...."
Rush,05/04/2016,Chanelle,F,752,,17,Hot as hell,"Gucci Rush is one of the few mainstream fragrances that has remained consistent in both the scent itself and in my appreciation from day one.
Late nineties: Gucci completely changes the image of the noble but trend-wise outdated Italian leather and fashion manufacturer and reinvents itself with the help of Tom Ford. The relaunch hits like a bomb, and Gucci Rush surpasses the label's first fragrance ""Envy"" by far in sales and success. The bottle of both fragrances comes from Tom Ford, and while Envy was still understated-elegant in appearance and feel, he created with Rush a bottle that truly polarized. It repelled me, as I was a fan of the old school when it came to bottles, and thus very fond of Shalimar and L'air du temps.
But the scent!
It was often mentioned in the same breath as cocaine, and the parallels are easy to recognize:
Hot and cold, exciting, a high indeed. RUSH as in Gold Rush, not Rush hour.
A sparkling sweetness runs through the scent profile, which has an inexplicable freshness despite the floral heaviness. I also notice a champagne mood that arises when I use Rush. And last but not least, it arouses a desire for sex, something I don't experience with any other fragrance.
The sillage is and was brilliant; you are noticed and you notice yourself.
Now a classic, groundbreaking, often copied, but never matched (Clive Christian has, in my humble opinion, also borrowed, but at what cost....)"
Rush,06/06/2016,Sweetsmell75,F,210,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,"Men's Magnet, Flower Sex or the Ultimate Experience?","Totally hooked by several comments here, I just had to test Gucci's Rush. I already knew the summer version Rush 2 from before, but I didn't find it that special either. So, I marched into the perfume store and tested the red plastic bottle that is referred to as a men's magnet.
It was a warm day, and I found the scent to be simply ""Wow"" ... probably also influenced by the many comments I had read here beforehand.
The bottle was on sale, so it came home with me... I was totally happy and euphoric, and the air conditioning blew the scent around me the entire way home. What a hit :) Provocative!
That evening, I went out to see the reactions. Nothing happened... no one said you smell good... or what a sexy scent. No, I had to hear from male friends that the scent doesn't suit me at all... etc. A big disappointment on my part :(
Now finally to the scent:
Rush starts with a loud peach-flower note that smells really delicious. But then something comes in that I must have totally overlooked in my euphoria. A lot of coriander... and the annoying thing is... the cooler the temperatures, the stronger this note becomes... I can't sniff it... it causes nausea, it comes out really bitter on my skin. I don't smell jasmine or rose at all.
Bitter-sweet, smelling like a mushy peach, it remains until Rush becomes bearable again.
When patchouli, vanilla, and vetiver unite, it becomes quite nice in the base. I find that enchanting... but the scent is already quite faint on me, so in this case, it might just be enough for flower sex :)
The longevity is about 8 hours, and the sillage is very loud at first... but it becomes quite quiet over time.
The red plastic bottle is quite nice and, above all, shatterproof.
Conclusion:
Overripe coriander-peach with a still beautiful drydown. Unfortunately, there's nothing magnetic about it for me ;)
I also apologize for my statement that was written in extreme euphoria after I got home from my perfume purchase.
To all those for whom the scent has the said effect... I'm really happy for you if it is the ultimate experience for you. My bottle can move out again... the coriander ruins the scent for me too much, and with nausea, not even a flower sex mood can arise ;)"
Rush,09/15/2016,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,17,distinctive brick,"When it comes to fragrance purchases, I am truly not a penny pincher - my dear husband can sing a song about it - but Rush is still not in my collection.

However, I don't find the scent bad at all - upon closer inspection, it's even distinctive.
I think the unwieldy brick bottle has dampened my desire to buy, because the eye eats - or rather, smells with.

But if I set aside the exterior, I encounter a meaningful fragrance.
Moreover, it is not ""in a rush"" - rather, it takes its time.

Floral freesia and juicy peach are well balanced, and receive a spicy twist from coriander.
Jasmine and rose gently but clearly join in, gaining stability from sweet vetiver and soft vanilla.
Patchouli adds a certain depth.

Not an everyday scent, as I unfairly assumed at first - due to its plastic block appearance.
Here, once again, the inner values count.

I notice that it is often gentlemen who take it to the checkout - either they wear it themselves or gift it to their girlfriend.
Both are possible.

For me, a scent with a delayed Aha effect - overwhelmingly."
Rush,01/10/2025,Käse,F,119,HELPFUL REVIEW,23,Bottle Philosophy,"The scent is quickly dealt with: For people who like fragrances with development, it can be interesting. KN has a certain freshness that gradually transitions into a powdery-solid base. No killer sillage, longevity is okay, overall it comes across as rather subtle-clean. It’s doable.

Let’s talk about the elephant in the room.
Imagine you are a perfumer. Gucci hires you: Create a scent for us. You say: Okay.
Instruction: It should result in a ""It’s doable"" scent. You think, weigh options, try one direction, attempt another, sniff, discard, redo, change things up, revisit something, time passes, final touches, scent finished. You know you haven’t created a unique masterpiece, but a fragrance with a decent 7.4 on Parfumo and it has been produced for over a quarter of a century - your effort, your expertise, and your result can’t be that bad.

And then they bottle your scent in a brick???????????
That’s how you go from perfumer to bullying victim. Or was a bet simply lost?

Mjaaa, I suppose, one could argue that it has a certain uniqueness. Unlike the similarly flat Idole bottles, it doesn’t fall over with every gust of air because it’s sensibly placed on the longer side. It takes a real gust of wind to knock it over.

I’ll accept uniqueness (if one is not familiar with the Idole bottles), but I’m not willing to attest originality to it. It is far from the elegant simplicity that a Chanel No. 5 bottle radiates.
They could have salvaged the thing if they had used somewhat higher quality materials. However, when I held the bottle in my hand yesterday, I was appalled by this cheap, lightweight plastic. Folks, that’s outright refusal to work. If I were teaching product design at a vocational college, the student who seriously handed me something like this should be careful that I don’t (**********); it would be more honest to just not submit anything at all.

What I give the bottle credit for: It negates aesthetics and value, but at least it doesn’t negate 200 years of emancipation, unlike those failed caricatures of Good Girl. Those things have nothing to do with shoes or bottles. My opinion.
That’s why it gets 1 point. On one hand, you can’t give 0.5 for bottles, and on the other hand, 0 is too little because the scent is delivered in a spray container, and at least you don’t have to carry the fragrance home in your bare hands."
Rush,07/06/2014,Honigmelone,F,19,,13,Getting high!,"I have owned Gucci Rush for a while now and can only describe it properly over time, as it develops differently depending on the outside temperature. At the Christmas market, it is a lovely floral companion, but it only unfolds its full potential for me at warmer temperatures. At the temperatures prevailing today (summery, but still bearable, at least in the apartment), it comes quite close to its name ""Rush,"" which translates to ""intoxication,"" among other things. The intoxication is hidden in a red Lego block, and the commercial for it is musically underlaid with beats: fast, electric, synthetic.

A synthetic touch seems to be present in Gucci's Rush as well. The scent is fruity-floral-spicy-powdery-milky. I find it difficult to pick out individual scent components; they are very closely intertwined. I also think I can recognize pineapple, yes, pineapple, and milk. Somehow, I even have to think of banana split. On one hand, it is sweet, but on the other hand, it rises up against the lovely sweetness and excessive pleasantness with an inherent roughness. Coriander could be responsible for this, as it creates an idiosyncratic connection with fruit and flower, and patchouli also comes into play. This roughness has something very intimate about it, somehow heading towards sweat. If there were more of it in the scent, I wouldn't dare to wear it. Over time, the intoxication becomes darker, deeper, more harmonious, and the roughness diminishes.

In midsummer - and I know this from personal experience - at around 36 degrees Celsius outside, it is an imposition for the environment, although it might also have been due to excessive dosing. I have no idea how much one has to pour over oneself to overwhelm the environment with it, but the mother of my former roommate managed to do that in our home. I’ll just say: super summer, very hot, you can't open the windows during the day because of the heat, and then Gucci Rush overwhelming in the apartment. I was done.

Gucci's Rush wants to play: with me, with my environment. Therefore, I wouldn't wear it to a business meeting. However, for a date, if I already know the man or can at least assess him. If I know that there is a certain harmony or attraction between us. Because I do not perceive Gucci's Rush as harmonizing precisely because of its rough component. It can intensify an existing attraction, but it only becomes calming and balancing later, when the aforementioned component recedes into the background.

The intoxicating scent lasts long on me, and I find the sillage bearable and definitely not overwhelming. However, a hallucinogenic effect has not occurred for me - even after multiple uses and different dosages. But that is not the purpose of this intoxication anyway."
Rush,05/06/2022,SinnHaft,F,5,,17,Loyal Companion,"The bottle is so off-putting, but it is also a testament to the fact that appearances can be deceiving. This ugly case (which unfortunately can never be completely emptied) has enchanted me and continues to do so even after 20 years.
I have never been so inspired by patchouli with vanilla and jasmine.
I couldn’t care less if it has become mainstream… I’ve been using it from the very beginning and it always awakens my inner goddess.
I would love more of this… but I would greatly appreciate a prettier bottle!"
Rush,12/10/2017,Sublim22,F,20,,8,"""Goldie's Scent"" or ""What Made Marv Crazy""","Does this community really need the 598th comment on this fragrance? Some will say: no, I already know it, I've had it, or I don't like it. Others may have only noticed the red block on the table with the offers and not paid further attention. However, since ""need"" plays only a minor role in this forum, regarding perfume in general and collections beyond, let's say, one to three bottles, I have decided to share a few words about Rush. Because this fragrance deserves it!

When it was released, Rush was a hit! The unusual bottle, fire red and made of plastic, was something completely different and fit well with the times. I didn't find the design beautiful back then. I prefer glass bottles, heavy and straightforward, or even opulent and sparkling, but in any case, with a pleasant feel. This flashy Lego brick is none of those. The handling is anything but nice. Awkward and annoying, until the spray finally lands where I want it, always at risk of needing to see a chiropractor afterward, with a dislocated wrist. With 5 sprays of Rush on, a joy for any therapist.

This scent blows me away; it is still sensational. When it came out, many had it, which is always the case with new releases, and there were other beauties at the time that were not to be underestimated. I liked it a lot, but after one bottle, it was over between us. Until I reclaimed it now. And it has reclaimed me!

A floral scent, indeed, and these are generally not my thing. But here, it lacks that cuteness, playfulness, that daisy and ruffle attitude that the Chloes, for example, are supposed to convey. This flower here is different. Sexy, self-assured, provocative. Feminine, but not girlish. And certainly not matronly. Longevity and sillage are top-notch. For me, Rush is a puregoing-out scent. To all the women on the prowl who enjoy flirting: spray on Rush, slip into jeans, leather jacket, and dive into the nightlife!

Anyone who knows the film Sin City surely still has the city amazons in mind and Goldie, who drove Marv crazy with her scent. It could have been Rush."

This red VHS tape look always put me off.
But I really have to say that the blind purchase was worth it after I became aware of the scent here in the forum.

As for the scent itself, I must first highlight the great longevity and, as mentioned above, the insane sillage.
With my hat, the top note somehow completely disappears.
Immediately, jasmine and rose spread out, which generally always come out very strong for me.
It seems to be a dark rose with many dangerous thorns.
From the base, a very sultry patchouli stands out, which makes the scent truly refined, mysterious, and absolutely sexy.
I have the image of sitting in a leather armchair.
Dark corset, red lipstick.
Some cigarette holder, whiskey - like Stifler's mom.
And yes, I like this image.
Young guys around offering me snacks and gazing at me.
I mean hey, if men pick up young girls, why shouldn't I do the same.
There are plenty of ladies who, even if only occasionally, appreciate a young guy.
Basically the opposite of a Lolita scent :-)

It's remarkable how scents like this can really give you confidence.
Confidence and strength.
They encourage me to be a little unreasonable for an evening.
Life is so short, and one should occasionally break the rules.

Be crazy once and escape all constraints.
Don't think about tomorrow.
Be a vamp.

You can do that in RUSH with the greatest pleasure.

However, you shouldn't spray too much.
Otherwise, you might come off as the Dangerous Woman, like a ""she-wants-to-know"" type.
And that doesn't have to be the case.

And even NON LETHAL WEAPONS can be very dangerous if used improperly and in excessive amounts!

So ladies, when you apply the scent:

Fill out the weapon permit, straighten your crown, and then:
ENJOY!!!!!!"
Rush,01/03/2018,Profuma,F,213,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Formula Rush,"Well, I've never come across anything like this! So cheeky! So frivolous! So red! So plastic and so unwieldy! And yes...so mmmh!
The list of ""so's"" could go on indefinitely and perhaps change a little every day. Because the scent is not always the same, just like the mood of the wearer isn't. Sometimes it seems cheerier to me, sometimes more subdued, sometimes cheeky, and then again more melancholic. One thing, however, is always true: it's unusual!
The ignition of this red fragrance powerhouse happens with a twist of Freesia and Gardenia, which really kick things into high gear. If you press the peach pedal right after, the engine practically roars. If you give it enough room with the right dash of coriander, the roaring turns into a loud and dangerous hissing! Then the fun begins! The red speedster revs its molecules until they smoke and finally launches from its starting point. You really have to keep a concentrated eye on it, or else it's out of sight. It has already left other drivers behind. The high-gloss body reflects sunlight briefly like a flash, then the ""sled"" takes the first curve and leaves behind a scent trail like no other. Jasmine and rose wear off quite quickly. Instead, patchouli is ignited, and not sparingly. As it approaches the next bend, vetiver intervenes and manages to contribute something hearty and fresh before the powerhouse starts to overtake the other cars. Relentlessly, it zips past them like a red arrow, some look downright left behind when it leaves them in its wake again. The class difference is clearly visible and leaves no questions unanswered. This red lacquered chassis has the devil in the gearbox, and it's letting loose passionately!
Gucci Rush is fast and sleek, curvy and alluring, feminine and energetic, unabashed and loud. You need a bit of courage or the right mood for such a race. And this car doesn't let just anyone take the wheel. You have to be enough of a woman to be allowed to get in, otherwise the scent strengths will overwhelm you, and instead of on the podium, you’ll end up in the piled-up tires at the side of the track or in the ditch.
It has to fit; otherwise, everything feels out of place. And I find the plastic container somewhat out of place for such a powerful and untamed scent. If it were any stronger, it would blow its unstable casing apart. What belongs here is a proper, heavy, deep red, straightforward bottle made of solid glass that keeps the inner demons in check until their release.
You wouldn't pack pearls in a jute bag or diamonds in a paper cup!"
Rush,04/17/2010,Kalix,F,87,,13,Red Hippie,"Rush is for me the hippie among my fragrances, even though it doesn't actually come from that era and I didn't experience that time myself. Yes, I have to think of the hippie movement of the 60s/70s with its search for new ideals, escape from societal constraints, Woodstock, the music of Jimi Hendrix, San Francisco, Johnny Depp in Blow. Feelings come from within us, from the gut, from the heart, and they don't need long justification.

At a first encounter with Rush, it is immediately clear - repulsive or extremely attractive. It's not a fragrance that a woman (man?) has to think long about. Upon first spraying, Rush hits the nose immediately and explosively. The description of the cute top note actually contradicts my perception. However, since coriander follows relatively quickly and then this absolutely g e n i u s connection with patchouli and vetiver takes place, the top note quickly becomes history. A strong preference for patchouli should be present.

The floral (the classic part) component (rose, magnolia, jasmine) has been well integrated, bringing together with patchouli and coriander sex and strong attraction, soft elements into play, a hint of vanilla. I don't even have to think of a dominatrix whip with this scent, nor do I want to.

I see this fragrance on quirky young women who stand out from the Heidi Klum breeding selection and have their own head and style, and definitely late hippies and all those who simply find Rush genius, like I do. Rush is close to the skin, deep and warm, yet not overly sweet, a truly successful oriental.

In this sense, friends, PEACE and be humane to one another!"
Rush,01/09/2021,Tradescantia,F,97,,8,No Overachiever - Still a Very Good Performance,"Here, I am oddly struck by a sense of nostalgia for high school.
To put it bluntly.
I was glad to have outgrown school, and my time there was, like for everyone, sometimes more and sometimes less amusing.
I experienced my first parties with Gucci Rush.

Memories of hedonistic pleasures and indulging in nihilistic thoughts, curious searching, finding, and discarding concepts come alive.

Personalities that would suit the perfume, in my opinion, would be Kate Moss or Amy Winehouse. Rush is not for the very well-behaved.
Spicy coriander meets floral notes and a synthetic peach. A matter of taste. Polarizing.

It doesn't quite fit me anymore, but I wouldn't want to miss it. I feel the same way about my white Fender Stratocaster, equipped with a temperamental tremolo that makes tuning it difficult.

I actually like the bottle, contrary to many opinions; the design has remained somewhat dry or plain in its statement, but the boxy shape reminds me of Lenovo ThinkPads and thus at least doesn't evoke any bad associations."
Rush,06/19/2016,DonJuanDeCat,M,2046,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,If only the coriander weren't there...,"Oh, Gucci. Why, why only?... Why are most of your fragrances so disappointing or at least just plain banal? I had fallen in love with Gucci pour Homme II (I unfortunately don't know the first Homme...) and then tested various other men's fragrances from Gucci. And although I don't know all the other fragrances yet, all those I tested were quite boring, unremarkable, and scents that you could actually forget after testing. And finding that out even hurt, after I had given GpH II a full 10 points!

I don't know yet if it's the same with the women's fragrances. At least, I've heard that Rush is supposed to be one of the better scents, according to a good friend. So now I'm excited to apply this fragrance and hope to smell a good Gucci scent again, even if it should (once again) be for you ladies.

Okay, I'm starting now... but I can already see that coriander is listed in the fragrance pyramid... it stands out to me!...

The scent:
The scent starts with freesias that smell slightly stuffy and floral. Along with that, you can smell a nice peach that gives the fragrance a fruity note. So far, so good, and everything is okay!
And then it’s there,… the coriander. Unmistakably malicious, it wreaks havoc in the otherwise nice fragrance and makes my mouth corners turn down, but I’ll hold off for now and hope that everything turns for the better…
The jasmine gives the fragrance a sweet note and also somewhat covers the coriander. But I still don’t find the scent that appealing, as it… well… doesn’t smell that great.
A light rose, slightly synthetic smelling, comes through and blends well with the jasmine, which by now also smells slightly powdery.
Well, after a while, the coriander recedes a bit and the floral notes lose some of their stuffiness. Now, slowly moving towards the base, patchouli and vanilla join in, although the vanilla is somewhat weak. The scent remains with a light peach note, a sweet jasmine-rose mix, and slightly powdery vanilla. The coriander, which has mostly faded, still lingers in the background and, in my opinion, gives the fragrance a disturbing and unpleasant note that brings the entire scent down a bit :(

The sillage and longevity:
The sillage is okay, the scent will be somewhat pleasant to smell, but I still find the ratings here on Parfumo a bit too high; however, it could also be that the fragrance may have been reformulated since 1999 and thus lost some strength. The longevity is okay at about eight hours.

The bottle:
The bottle is rectangular, slim, and made of plastic. It has a red color and the name of the fragrance is written on the side. The spray head is integrated in the middle, which you just have to press down. Interesting in itself, but it looks like it’s more from the 80s or early 90s.
And strictly speaking, one could even consider it as a somewhat oversized sweetener dispenser. Nevertheless, I find the bottle quite okay, as it is something different.

Well, what can I say. Rush has not turned out to be a standout, which is just my opinion, as I don’t like coriander and this fragrance especially radiates a bit too much of it in the initial phase and, of course, the heart note before it fades a bit in the base, but is still detectable. Without it, the fragrance would have actually been much better and would have received a significantly higher rating from me.
Well, Rush has the potential to be better. I wonder if Rush 2 is better... I’ll have to test it sometime!

Because especially in summer, coriander can be very piercing, while all the other fragrance notes are rather tuned for summer or warm days, as the scent is sweet but not overwhelmingly sweet. It’s suitable for many situations, maybe even for going out, although it could have a stronger sillage for that (which would probably also have intensified the coriander… a vicious circle!).

So, for those who are not very bothered by coriander (as it is weaker in the base), you get an above-average good fragrance from Gucci. It is definitely worth testing, but whether you will smell nice with it… well, you’ll have to try that for yourself; I think probably not :D"
Rush,05/14/2011,Hasi,F,130,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,0,Mistress Lillifee,"Rush starts off sweet-sour fruity and with a tingling sensation in the nose. Others mention pepper, but the scent reminded me more of an overripe peach that is slowly fermenting and taking on a slightly alcoholic, sparkling note.

What bothers me is this cheesy note that develops very close to the skin with the first spray. I read online that certain citrus fruits as well as certain wines (the fermenting peach?) can produce this cheesy scent character. There is also a cheesy character in the malt absolute used in Thierry Mugler's ""Human Scent."" Perhaps the cheesiness is the scent note that Murcie perceives in her great comment as ""animal presence that almost brushes against the obscene."" After all, it should also imitate the human scent in TM.

I became aware of Rush through Murcie's comment, and she was so kind to send me a sample (thank you, Murcie!). But personally, I find Rush too sweet and nice due to its fruitiness. I don't find anything obscene here. No dominatrix. But also no gray mouse. It should be a middle ground. Mistress Lillifee, indeed.

And her accessories would look like THIS:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I perceive Rush as very close to the skin with little sillage, and the top and heart notes are very rush past.
What remains is a powdery, sweet vanilla scent. But it lasts quite a while. I could still smell it the next morning.
Patchouli hardly comes through on my skin, but it is very present (and delicious!) on the test strip. I can also find the coriander there."
Rush,01/20/2013,Harielle,F,28,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!","As I wrote elsewhere virtually: Gucci Rush is ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" in a bottle! The name says it all, this stuff has real speed!

The cherry-red plastic bottle, resembling my son's Lego bricks, prepares you for this unusual fragrance that doesn't rely on top, heart, and base notes.

Rush's fragrance components, including magnolia, freesia, patchouli, rose, and hmmmm, vanilla, join hands to slyly and cheerfully outpace one another. When the losing accord catches up with the others, it does so not to merge with them into a harmonious blend that relaxes on the wearer's skin, no! Like a spiral, it outshines the others, who fall behind and slightly stumble, only to charge ahead again shortly after.

Impetuous, yet perfectly balanced, this floral-milky-fruity-vanilla whirlwind dances on the skin. Sometimes it smells predominantly floral with a fruity accent that somehow reminds me of apples. Just as I come to this conclusion and inhale another whiff of Rush, I catch a hint of patchouli, slightly spicy components, and vanilla, which have stepped forward in a flattering and irresistible manner, promising me, like sirens, that the next adventure is surely coming. And one thing is clear, no adventure, no ""Faster Pussycat!"" without Rush, this crazy, irrationally unforgettable (neo-)chypre.

Just the thought that this ""substance"" might be discontinued triggers acute withdrawal symptoms in me..."

Rush,12/09/2010,Grauauge,F,9,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Burnt Brain Waves,"Yes, yes, Rush is a fragrance that polarizes.
I came across this scent four years ago when a colleague wore it. I liked it immediately (on her), and thus I was tempted into a spontaneous blind buy. Well, you all know how it goes. The initial euphoria quickly turned into a gag reflex when I sprayed it for the first time.

I only smelled pepper (of the worst kind) that went straight through my nose and flooded every single brain wave.
Panic set in.
This must be how an attacker feels when they get a face full of pepper spray from their victim!

This cannot possibly be THE scent I smelled on my colleague.
It was quickly scrubbed off and banished to the very back of my bathroom cabinet, never to return.

As it goes - after some time, I gave the fragrance a second chance.
This time, very, very sparingly dosed, I didn't have that ""shotgun pepper blast"" feeling as intensely.
I remained persistent and brave and wore the scent all day.

And suddenly - whoosh - after the initial pepper disaster, the fragrance began to unfold beautifully. I smelled like a wonderful bouquet: gardenia (very strong), freesia, and definitely peach.

Fantastic - THAT was what I smelled on my colleague.

The scent is very intense and lasts fantastically long on me. When I wear it all day, I smell the lovely vanilla by evening.

Conclusion: If you heroically survive the pepper spray blast, something wonderful unfolds that lasts immensely long."
Rush,07/31/2013,UnicornCoco,F,374,,5,They probably wanted to go all in on Sex Sells in their ad,"The big marketing creative directors at Gucci should know better and, at the latest since Lindstrom, that sex only advertises itself.
In the end, the ad is anyway inappropriate for the fragrance, which initially smells overly loaded and unpleasantly of freesias and gardenias, and later transforms into a very sweet and actually quite delicious scent of artificial roses and vanillas. Patchouli acts as a big plus in the background, but overall it remains a teen fragrance for me, no longer suitable for anyone over 15. Other associations are images of innocent underwear printed with strawberries."
Rush,02/01/2014,NadsSpatz,F,596,,2,In a Rush?,"~ Inspiration ~
I once tested Rush II and found it quite good, as it reminded me of sunscreen. Recently, I happened to receive a sample of Rush.

~ Bottle ~
Cumbersome, but extraordinary.
The square, narrow shape and especially the striking color draw attention. The name means something like ""hurry"" or ""rush"" and conveys a fast and hectic impression to me, which, however, does not match the scent.

~ Fragrance ~
The top note impresses with peach, but the freesia keeps it from being too sweet. In the heart note, rose and jasmine come to the forefront, blending with the peach. Coriander adds a slightly spicy undertone. It is rounded off in the base note by patchouli, vanilla, and vetiver. I perceive it as fruity-floral-creamy-spicy.

~ Longevity ~
On my skin, it lasts about 7-8 hours (a bit longer on clothing and hair). 2 sprays are sufficient, as it might become too intense and sweet.

~ Occasion ~
I find that it suits work well in spring or summer, but also for leisure activities. For evenings or going out, it is too boring for me.

~ Conclusion ~
There is a certain similarity to AN'NA by Annayake and Bruno Banani Woman. Those who like these fragrances will also find Rush great. Unfortunately, there are too many notes in this perfume that I do not like as much (peach, rose, and vetiver)."

Young woman, I want to approach you IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE you are wearing Gucci Rush!

Or:

Young woman, forgive me, but please keep at least 5 meters away - BECAUSE you are wearing Gucci Rush.....

I personally am male and wear this fragrance.... On people for whom it works well, it smells very sexual and sensual, and one should be aware of that.

It is rather less suitable for the office, although sometimes I wear it during the day out of longing for this scent........"

Rush,05/23/2025,Kerkyra74,F,669,,2,Lay back and remember to the 90s,"Wonderful or not for other generations... I have a well-known fondness for discontinued fragrances and rarities, so I was all the happier to be able to call a very generous decant of this retro candidate my own, thanks to a dear friend from the perfume community. The old-timers will remember this beautiful scent, which starts off cocktail-like with a peach. I immediately think of Grandma's peach punch, clean freesia, which we know from Chloe Signature, and gardenia, which always brings that green blooming garden feeling for me. Spicy coriander, but beware, definitely not soapy here! Yes, those were the days when the heart, top, and base notes together had at least 12 components. In conclusion, still no olfactory rush hour. Spring in a bottle! Clean, fruity, and green-floral, essentially a freshie from the 90s. The only downside is the shabby bottle, which has always kept me from adding it to my collection."

It smells unpleasant to me, it reminds me of something I don't like. Patchouli is too little for me here. One scent note bothers me immensely, maybe the coriander? It smells spicy and sweet and warm and heavy. I think of older ladies and the faux leather of the old ""DDR"" trains. The bottle is really ugly too. I first thought there was a camera lying around.

Well, soon I will probably be lighter by one perfume again."
Rush,10/04/2010,Confusion,F,142,,0,Not for me - or maybe it is?,"Well, in that sense, it is mine. I once received it as a gift and sprayed it two or three times to try it out, but I never went out with it. It smells terrible on me. Synthetic, it stings the nose. This doesn’t get any better even after wearing it for a longer time. On others, however, I like the way it smells; it has a high recognition value. No, it’s not for me.

Addendum, 24.11.2010:
I just checked on eBay what prices one can achieve for a 75ml bottle that has been sprayed three to four times. It could be worth it... After that, I thought I might give it another try - and lo and behold, is it fear of loss or has my taste or sense of smell changed in such a short time? In any case, I suddenly don’t find it so terrible anymore. Still sweet-spicy (yes, I find it sweet), still a bit synthetic, but somehow... better. I will test it throughout the day tomorrow (for which occasion which perfume is for, work or leisure or anything else, usually doesn’t matter to me; I just go by the season and my mood) and then possibly revise my previous judgment.
Result: No. It just doesn’t fit. I will not keep it."
Gucci pour Homme,02/05/2012,Missk,F,1357,,3,Sexy spiciness,"I had almost given up on Gucci fragrances. I had disliked all the female scents, (with the exception of Envy Me 2) and had little enthusiasm when I came around to trying their male scents.

What can I say? I like all that I have tried so far. Gucci pour Homme is to die for.

This fragrance is spicy, woodsy and masculine; all that a man should be. With such complexity within this composition one might expect a disaster, but have no fear, Gucci pour Homme is so well blended.

The opening is extremely powerful. One should wait until the fragrance has settled and dried on the skin before inhaling this wonderous scent. The top notes are mostly intense spices with a smokiness that resembles the scent of a smouldering cigar. The whole experience is almost aromatic.

Towards the drydown, incense, papyrus, leather, musk, vetiver, vanilla, patchouli and oakmoss become more prominent, creating an earthy and dry finish that is rather sensual, warm and mysterious. The sillage and lasting strength is better than good. It is truly amazing.

I haven't come across anything that smells this good on a man yet. I do more than recommend this fragrance, I urge all men to go out and buy it."
Gucci pour Homme,02/23/2023,Minixito12,M,8,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Be careful,"I had never smelled this perfume until this year, I am a young person. I blind bought it because of the hype this one has in the market.
What I have learned about vintage and discontinued fragrance is that yes, they are good, but people say wonderful things about them because they are perfumes that accompanied them for years in their lives, with which they created memories, with which they grew up.

When you smell a perfume that you had a long time ago, it creates a knot in your stomach that makes you relive everything you lived when you applied it and it is wonderful, but when a person has never smelled that perfume before, he/she has a completely different vision.
Gucci I is a good perfume, vintage-like. Men's perfumery in these years has taken another direction, so it doesn't say anything to me.
It's a good perfume, no doubt about it, but not for me. I would not recommend this perfume to someone who has never had it or smelled it, and even less at the current prices."
Gucci pour Homme,03/06/2013,Miaw2,M,339,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Dark woods,"In my opinion it's the best designer's woody/incense fragrance that i have and tried. Extremely masculine and sexy.

Some herbs and spices in the opening. In the middle phase i can smell a pimento note and some pepper but soon the woody notes joins and then it develops to a rather dark/heavy woody fragrance with incense.

Excellent sillage, lasting power and projection. Smells more mature. Definitely worth it.

Gucci pour Homme,01/26/2013,Silverfire,M,134,,5,The Orange Juice Let-down,"I've never worn a Gucci fragrance before. There I said it. So please forgive a non-haute-fashion perspective on this fragrance, but I'll cut to the chase if this is already offending your fashion sense: I was unimpressed.

Yes, the orange color was interesting, but the fact that my sample came in a orange translucent pouch was not (at least the color avoided the condom implications of Porsche Design's The Essence).

What I got out of this was a full-scale, Defcon 5, round-up-everyone-for-military-service-including-70-year-old-men-who-can-barely-walk PEPPER ATTACK! This lasts for six hours and is so intense that I sneezed a few times. Not fun. Eventually it moderates somewhat and introduces a slight smoke accord, followed much later by some aromatic non-cedar woods. The fragrance structure would suggest base notes here, but the only woods that fit the description are top notes. Oh, and of course there's the annoying vanilla note somewhere between the beginning and the end, but it's mercifully short.

So Gucci, you haven't won me over. Plenty of scents use pepper without burying me in it (Herrera and Memoir Man, for instance). I realize that my skin amps pepper quite a bit, but this was just short of Yatagan-induced nausea for me."

I sprayed it on a was instantly in love and we went back to see if they had anymore. Unfortunately they did not. Well I used the bottle up until it was bone dry thinking I would find another somewhere and by the time I did it was already going for over $100. Now it is astronomical if you can find it.

Gucci pour Homme,02/23/2025,RogerJr17,M,26,,3,Gucci Pour Homme 1. We got that wood,"Gucci Pour Homme 1 is definitely an experience and I'm very lucky to be able to smell it and have a bottle myself. I've heard this stuff has become discontinued and very hard to find. I have almost a full bottle and I'm going to be using it sparingly. GPH1 is one of the few designer fragrances that helped build up my collection. GPH1, TDH, and Polo Blue were my trifecta. I will eventually have reviews out for all of those so I hope you enjoy them. I went into GPH1 blind so here's what I got from the rocky beginning to the much calmer review.

The Smell: GPH1 Is a beautiful scent that leans on the masculine side. Women can pull it off too. If you're a fan of the woods, cedar, with a hint of pepper and that legendary drydown, this is for you. There are a ton of notes listed in the breakdown regardless where you go. I've learned early that the breakdown isn't accurate. Feel it out yourself. It's heavy on the cedar and pepper on my skin. I've read where people compare it to pencil shavings and, while they're entitled to that opinion, I disagree. If I had pencil shavings that smelled this good, I would've had it made in high school. It pretty much stays with the cedar and the pepper throughout the life of the fragrance on me with the amber showing up late to the party per usual. As far as designer scents go, not many do woods like this one. This one can put many niche scents to shame also so that should tell you it's a competitor.
Rating: 8/10

Projection: Pretty good. Usually wood scents will dial it up on the projection especially because they typically have amazing heart and bottom notes. It's no difference with GPH1. It starts out strong and keeps going for about the first 4-5 hours and then it dissipates to somewhat of a skin scent on me for the remainder. Going by my usual process, 4-5 hours would be an automatic 5 or lower (other intangibles to consider). 4-5 hours of solid projection plus the fact that it hangs around after that and people can still smell it on me while about 4-6 feet away is still great. If you're looking for the ""loud and proud"" scent on this one, go back to the Invictus/Sauvage counter because that's more up your alley. This isn't that, nor does it try to be. It's great how it is.
Rating: 7/10

Price Point: Here's where it gets tough. You have to dig to find this thing. It's been discontinued so you'll be paying anywhere from $95-$450 USD (eBay). It's crazy. You just better hope you get the cheaper end. I, personally, don't believe that GPH1 is worth $450 so the minute you get to the $200 range, I'd be backing off on the gas.
Rating: 5/10, possbility 8/10 if you can get it for cheaper

Versatility: GPH1 is amazing. I've worn it to every scenario I could think of and it seemed to do well in each one. Work? Great. Date? Amazing. Class? Good. I will say it performs best in the cooler months (Fall, Winter, & possibly the cooler parts of Spring). I learned the hard way that people don't like it when you wear a strong woody fragrance around them in the dead of summer. Pay attention to your situation and it'll do just fine.
Rating: 8/10

Final Verdict: 7/10 by the numbers. I ranked it around an 8-8.5 mark. I really love this stuff which kinda sucks at the same time because unless they bring it back, getting my hands on another bottle will be very painful. Therefore, I'm gonna use it sparingly. Special occasions only! I recommend if you can pick up a bottle and you love woody scents, this is a must have. Doesn't matter if it's a designer scent or not. It does things that the niche side still struggles with!"
Gucci pour Homme,12/03/2013,ParfumAholic,M,257,,39,How does a myth come into being?,"Why is it that we often only come to appreciate many things (and unfortunately also people) when they are no longer around, when they are no longer there?

Loss awakens desires through reflection and memories of what once was. Clearly an old principle of humanity.

People like Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Gianni Versace, J.F. Kennedy, or Lady Di were already shining figures during their lifetimes, favorites of the masses and the press alike. With the tragic death of each individual, these people became posthumous myths. If they had not died young and tragically, but had aged normally, perhaps today no one would be as interested in them.

Perhaps similar thoughts were considered at Gucci or LVMH? How does one make a fragrance immortal? One lets it die young.

I still vividly remember my first encounters with ""Gucci pour Homme."" How this fragrance swept me away and captivated me at the time. My absolute signature winter scent. Back then, I didn’t think about fragrance pyramids, top, heart, and base notes. The main thing was that the fragrance smelled good and was housed in a presentable bottle. It could be that simple!

Today, this fragrance still excites me, or rather, it excites me again. I have only now truly understood what a masterpiece Michel Almairac has created here.

Yes, this fragrance is essentially just made of incense. Incense in excess and me? That usually doesn’t work, but in this case, it does, because ""Gucci pour Homme"" is not a church incense scent, but a luxurious interpretation of this fragrance component:

Top note: Incense with a fresh kick from basil, tarragon, and lemon

Heart note: Incense spiced with pepper and patchouli

Base note: Incense with softeners like amber, tonka, vanilla

Top note to base note: Incense on various woods

Boring? Definitely not. I perceive ""Gucci pour Homme"" as a very noble, luxurious, warm, cosmopolitan, and elegant fragrance. From my perspective, it is not a scent for ""youngsters,"" but requires life experience and first ""life scars"" to truly unfold. First wrinkles and other signs of time go perfectly with this fragrance.

Moreover, the bottle is magnificent. This heavy glass cube with the seemingly floating fragrance inside, reminiscent of the color of cognac. For tactile people like me, a dream!

For me personally, ""Gucci pour Homme"" is THE fragrance from Gucci; nothing that followed could come close to it. Neither in terms of quality nor regarding longevity and projection.

Dear people at Gucci / LVMH: You have done everything right with this fragrance. Christmas is coming soon, in Italy and France just as in Germany. I wish for an unchanged comeback of this class fragrance. Is there anything that can be done?"
Gucci pour Homme,06/13/2014,Umkehrfilm,M,19,,37,I,"When a fragrance reaches a certain age, or has been discontinued, and 21 (detailed) comments have already been written about it, it’s no longer about dissecting it, describing it, and breaking it down into top, heart, and base notes, but about something else.

I was sitting on a couch back then when a buddy held a nearly empty bottle under my nose. Quite curious, I stole a spritz for my wrist, and it was all over for me; no two days later, this heavy, dark glass monster was in my cabinet. And since then, I’ve been hooked on it. It accompanied me daily to my training, to every party, every birthday, every shopping trip, to university, to every country, every date, and every bed. Sometimes it felt as if I could skip reapplying, as the scent was always perceptible around me. I was simply Gucci. My closest friend once said during a club visit: “...no matter where you’re hanging out, if I want to drive and can’t find you, I just follow my nose, and I’ll find you.” Well... she always found me.

My fascination for this fragrance stems from the fact that, in my eyes, there has never been anything that could suit me better. Of course, that’s complete nonsense, but it felt as if Almairac had created this scent just for me. Plus, I was still very young (18?), I had acquired a Gucci fragrance that was, for my standards, very expensive, and I sprayed it, more than lavishly, all over my body, my (faux) leather jacket, my ripped jeans, and white t-shirts. It’s about more than that; it’s about a feeling, a way of life, about disrespect for overpriced consumer goods, to which one seems to be addicted, while actually hating capitalism and wanting to abolish it. When I eventually learned that it had been discontinued, I thought it was a bad joke. Well... I still think it’s a bad joke. That dark smoke, the sweet incense, and the dry, creaky wood. I miss you dearly. So the search began; I lost myself in forums and comparisons, I must find a substitute for it somewhere.
Countless test runs later, the bitter realization: No. There is no substitute. No matter how close they come, they cannot replace it.

I used the last milliliters about a year ago, unknowingly, on a very special evening -> “Oh, how beautiful love must be; when I grow up, I want to love too,” I don’t want to provide more information on that. The bottles are slowly losing their remaining scent, my clothes have long been washed, and Gucci pour Homme belongs to the past. If I could now finally quit smoking, I’m really trying hard, that would be the end of an era. My era.

But since I’m a good junkie, today 15ml were filled and left in my mailbox. I will cherish them and can now, whenever I feel like it, indulge in memories of the past. So there’s only one thing left to say:

Fuck you, Gucci!"
Gucci pour Homme,01/10/2017,DonJuanDeCat,M,2046,,8,"Gucci, what have you become?...","Gucci. With the fragrance Gucci pour Homme II, Gucci completely convinced me back then. A totally wonderful scent, slightly sweet, slightly peppery, and of course with its fantastic black tea note, I was smitten from the very first whiff, and it was clear that this fragrance had to be part of my collection.

To be honest, this was also my first encounter with a Gucci fragrance. At that time, I thought I had discovered a new amazing brand for myself and eagerly set out to try all the other Gucci fragrances. And after testing a few, I eventually ended up in tears, but not from joy, no, but from pure disappointment. None, absolutely none of the other Gucci fragrances came close to GpH II, making this wonderful scent feel like a lucky find, as if Gucci had created such a fantastic fragrance purely by chance and luck... the predecessor, this scent here, GpH I, was already sold out back then, so I couldn't test whether this fragrance was indeed as great as well.

Well, I finally got my hands on a sample of GpH I... oh, if you only knew how much anticipation I had when the sample finally arrived. And I can tell you one thing: The wait for this sample was worth it!

The scent:
The scent starts off both spicy and woody. The citrus notes are more in the background; you can smell the basil more, and as mentioned, the wood is very prominent. Since papyrus wood is mentioned, with a little imagination, the scent can indeed feel like flipping through an (older) book (but in a nice way; it’s not the musty cellar scent that clings to books after long storage in a cellar :D). Besides the basil, I also perceive a strong but not piercing pimento.
A little later, the woody notes become even stronger (but no wonder, I’m currently reading in the fragrance pyramid about more woody notes), while the spices recede, including the pimento (so those who don’t usually like peppery scents can still take a look here).
The scent is rather unsweetened, as there is only a slight sweetness in the background. Additionally, there is a very light, earthy patchouli that fits well with the woody scent and the now emerging resinous and smoky notes.
Towards the base, the scent becomes a bit milder, which may be due to notes like vanilla, tonka bean, amber, and musk. These are only very faintly present, but you can still clearly notice how they change the scent progression and soften both the spices and the strong woody notes, while the woodiness still plays the main role (with cedar being the strongest among the woody notes). The amber can, however, be smelled quite well a bit later :D

The sillage and longevity:
The scent starts off quite strong but then diminishes a bit in the next 15-20 minutes. It is therefore above average in strength and will still be well perceived by others. I think GpH I is a bit stronger than GpH II.
The same goes for longevity, as the scent easily lasts eight hours and a bit more.

The bottle:
The bottle is rectangular with a very thick glass bottom and is filled with brownish fragrance liquid. The front simply displays the name of the fragrance. The bottom of the bottle is dotted or ribbed, giving it a great look and a nice tactile feel. The cap is large, solid, and black. A very beautiful and high-quality bottle.

What has happened to Gucci...? Why do their fragrances, especially the men’s fragrances, no longer have the class and the pleasantly convincing scent of the past, long discontinued fragrances?
Why is there “something” like Guilty pour Homme, which smells absolutely bland and totally banal and boring, and the only good thing about it is the Gucci logo because it reminds me, as a freak, of the Batman logo??

* sigh *

Gucci pour Homme I is almost completely different from Gucci pour Homme II, except that both contain some spicy pimento and use the same bottle. But Gucci pour Homme I has also become an excellent men’s fragrance that is totally convincing due to its above-average sillage and longevity. There is also a difference in usability, as I find that Homme I is more of an autumn and winter scent while Homme II could actually be worn at any time.

But wow, what a great scent!
I prefer Gucci pour Homme II because of its tea note, but this predecessor here has also become an excellent fragrance, making one really regret that it is no longer available. I think I will eventually buy a bunker bottle of Gucci II for safety, before this scent is discontinued as well...

Well,... it’s not really my style to talk like this, but I have to say that Gucci is really messing things up right now, at least when it comes to most men’s fragrances. Since today, by chance, I saw the collectible magazines of Star Wars helmets in a magazine shop and immediately bought the issue with the Darth Vader helmet (and yes, I am a damn freak, damn it!...),... I’ll make the following comparison: While Gucci pour Homme I and II are as great as Star Wars Episodes 4-6 (as well as the new and great Rogue One), most other Gucci men’s fragrances are about as good as Star Wars Episode I (though among them, there might still be one or two scents that are at least as good as Episodes II or III :DD)
* sigh * * sigh *

I really hope that one day Gucci pour Homme III will come, but to be honest, I don’t really believe that…

And if you ever get your hands on this fragrance, don’t miss the chance to at least test it once!"
Gucci pour Homme,03/04/2014,FabianO,M,1008,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,"""Ambre Orients"" older brother - please, Gucci, let it (come) back to life!","Man, oh man, another fragrance that drives me to despair just thinking about what must be going through the minds of decision-makers at a perfume house to discontinue such a fine scent without any apparent reason.

Instead, these people ""delight"" us with soulless and artistically worthless junk like ""Guilty"" and ""Made to measure"".

One of my first thoughts upon re-testing after almost 10 years: Armani must have taken his inspiration for ""Ambre Orient"" from here.

""Gucci pour homme"" is an extraordinarily beautiful, smooth oriental fragrance, warm, sensual, slightly sweet-resinous-smoky.

The opening is more inviting and harmonious than in ""Ambre Orient"", which hits quite hard on the curry note.

Sure, the ingredients of the two differ noticeably, but the fundamental character of both is very similar.

Gucci starts off with a spicy-oriental vibe, tarragon, petitgrain, and incense create a slightly sweet, woody-dried-fruity, sacred impression, seductive, well-composed.

A good dose of delicate pepper enhances the whole thing in a nicely piquant way, patchouli complements the sacred incense in the heart phase and shifts the aroma field towards resinous-woody smoke, very soft and balsamic through prominent amber notes.

It gets a bit more vanillic in the base, where the fundamental, mild incense provides the framework and spicy essences like sage and clove exude a masculine effect.

Overall, one of the most beautiful (affordable) orientals I have encountered so far, alongside ""M7 Oud Absolu"" or ""Jubilation XXV"".

Gucci, how about it? Do the fragrance world this great favor! You hold the resurrection in your hands!"
Gucci pour Homme,10/20/2021,Barcarus,M,11,,10,The best scent on this earth,"For me, the best scent that has ever existed.
It is a feast for the eyes, truly a simple and elegant bottle design. The fragrance is incomparable and long-lasting. It's hard to describe, as I'm not yet well-versed in the notes, but I would say the wood note is prominent and the bergamot is in the foreground.

The day it was discontinued is one of the darkest in perfume history for me.
Take my firstborn if it is brought back! ;-)"
Gucci pour Homme,09/04/2014,Fateichel,M,22,,10,A Legend?,"For me, yes.
When you delve into the scent, it is for many something like a myth... a legend. Perhaps also because it was discontinued so quickly and at its peak.
It represents a very specific class of men.
And so I felt a bit frozen and special when my bottle, which I snagged on eBay, arrived yesterday.
I applied it and it made an ""instant"" click.
I immediately understood what it means - for whom it stands and what story it has.
Maybe I'm just blinded.
But I just feel something.
Something that touches me - and that's what life is about... right?

And I must say... it is also a truly outstanding scent! New school, fresh... paired with old school vanilla, amber, incense!
Plus, this incredible genius bottle. It looks like the whiskey glass for the perfumes of this world.
Feel like Gentlemen?
YES, I LIKE!"
Gucci pour Homme,05/23/2018,Sonny94,M,51,,0,The Phantom,"Once again, a phantom that the community mourns. Another discontinued fragrance a’la Relax by Davidoff, overrated to the max, or rather a milestone that was discontinued too early a’la Patou Pour Homme. I find it difficult to categorize this fragrance.

Let’s talk about the scent. The opening is dominated by incense, just like the heart and base notes! To be honest, the incense is so strong that I can hardly smell any other ingredient! Vanilla, basil, tarragon - not a chance. Vetiver and musk, definitely!
It doesn’t really matter as long as you like the scent. I like it, but compared to Pour Homme 2, it falls short.
A noble fragrance for the evening and for the colder seasons. Longevity is very good, lasting about 8 hours.

If I had to categorize it, I would place it in the category ""It would be nice if it came back, but I wouldn’t mind if it stayed gone.""

One thing I can tell you, I would not trade with a demon of crossroads and sell my soul for this fragrance, certainly not."
Gucci pour Homme,03/21/2013,Terra,M,646,HELPFUL REVIEW,0,"Priest, oh Priest you horny pig","This is the most beautiful incense scent I have ever tested. I am not baptized, have no strong connections to Christianity... and yet I always associate the smell of incense with something ""church-like."" The opening of Gucci pH also begins slightly sacred. For me, it is almost pure incense, even though it is only listed in the base. However, this fades quite quickly and the whole thing becomes calmer, warmer, and somehow ""different."" A note joins in that reminds me of the medicinal oud note in Duro by Nasomatto or in Cuirs by Carner Barcelona. In fact, it is quite clear.
Maybe my nose is going a bit crazy after testing 5 fragrances today... but for me, this scent is warm incense, a subtle sweetness, and a medicinal oud note, even though there is no oud present... I am sure that this impression comes from the incense combined with other notes.
In any case, this makes the scent erotic, sexy... masculine, dominant.

Yes... it is like the priest who is actually a corrupt womanizer under his robe.

One of the most beautiful scents I have had the pleasure of smelling in a long time.

How could Gucci let something so beautiful die... terrible"
Gucci pour Homme,04/28/2011,Unikat,F,23,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,12,"I’m silly, wrote a comment, dreamed of the fragrance in excitement, and deleted the comment...","What I wanted to say is:
I will not give up hope that no one will look at me funny when I wear this scent as a woman.
I am so enthusiastic about the fragrance, my absolute favorite! Woody, spicy, warm, delicious, serious, and so perfect that everything fits together, nothing is missing, and nothing stands out. Like a forty-year-old, successful man who doesn’t like haste in his life, a stable job for years, house, dog, classic car, children, a wife - first love and forever. A dream man..... Well.... When I feel like something is missing, I don’t cheat, I take this perfume from my husband’s closet (by the way, my gift)!!!
I lack nothing from my husband, but from myself. And with this scent, I feel anti-childish, anti-pink, anti-ordinary woman.
It goes perfectly with my shirts, black high heels, tight jeans,
Then I am - I myself, just as I am and still a woman.
Unfortunately, I can’t sniff out so many ingredients because I’m already looking forward to the base note. It’s damn woody! Old, sun-dried wood. Amber, tonka bean, musk, incense dominate powerfully! I can still smell a hint of beeswax... with a bit of honey....
The scent is warm, woody, cozy, smoky! Amber...
As a woman, I can say that I feel very secure and well taken care of when I’m next to a man who wears this scent.

Gucci pour Homme,03/09/2013,Leimbacher,M,2870,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Legends unfortunately die early,"Today tested in a wonderful private perfumery in Düsseldorf, but unfortunately it wasn't available for purchase there anymore. I would have paid up to €100 for it, but even though I personally find the eBay prices too high, it would probably still be worth it. Because Gucci PHI is probably Gucci's best perfume and the masterstroke. Gucci PHII is also great and I haven't tested Rush yet, but it hardly gets better for winter and somehow this scent was also a trendsetter for newcomers like Potion, which I also like, but it is not nearly as masterful. Why does Gucci discontinue such things and focus on Guilty? Well, I don't think I need to say anything about that, it's a shame.

The bottle is heavy and one of the most timeless and stylish. The sillage is strong and spicy-masculine. Whether at the Christmas market or at winter festivities or even Christmas - this scent would not wither in my collection. And maybe it will still be in my collection someday, that would be a dream. There is one downside, which was the longevity today. I wouldn't have thought it would give up after just 7 hours. But it might also have been due to the age of the tester or the day's condition. And one more personal note. The personal note is that I tested a few of the most expensive and high-quality niche perfumes in the luxury boutiques today. Because of this, I probably need to make my entire rating system a bit stricter so that not too many score 100%. Because there are even better scents than this one. But in the mainstream area, this quality is a rarity! Also, I usually don't go for spicy scents, but this one is too good not to love!

I smell spices, incense, a bit of pepper & cinnamon, tiny citrus splashes, and also a bit of wood. It almost reads like a cake recipe, and if it were one, it would be worthy of a wedding cake.

If I could bring 3 dead scents back to life, Gucci PHI would definitely be one of them, and it was a great loss for the men's fragrance world! But legends are not stopped by an early death.

ADDENDUM (04.14.'13): I was finally able to get it, I'm super happy to have it in my collection, even if it's just the 50 ml and I can only wear the scent again in 6 months when the weather is right :) A very special fragrance experience, thanks to my colleague ;-) !"
Gucci pour Homme,10/15/2021,Duftreise,M,2,,10,Woulda-coulda-...,"In 2004, I found myself at Douglas with a tight budget, faced with a choice: Gucci Homme or Eau d'Issey. In the end, I chose the latter. The story of Issey doesn't belong here; it unfolded very amicably, that much can be revealed. I only came across the Gucci again when the discontinuation of Gucci II sparked a double lament. I had tested Gucci II during a sale and found it just okay. Curiosity then led me to a vintage bottle of the number 1, and lo and behold: regret set in. It is so exciting, and I actually remember well how I felt in 2004; I thought the same back then, but I didn't have the courage to go for it.
Now, what excites me about it: It is simply different yet incredibly balanced. Incense-woody-spicy, slightly sweet, but not too much, a bit floral and citrusy, but far from a cologne.
It gives the fantastic feeling of growing a few centimeters, steps feel lighter, and one is more present. It would be interesting to know one's own biography counterfactually as a what-if. If life (which I have no complaints about!) had unfolded differently, would I have chosen it?

Gucci pour Homme,02/07/2023,Mart86,M,6,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Lost Love I.,"A block of glass. Heavy, solid, and with a gold-brown core of liquid aphrodisiac.

I still remember how I once welcomed you into my small collection during my wild phase of growing up. We met in an orange drugstore chain. You were sitting there quite inconspicuously, yet powerfully on your shelf, about the third or fourth row, looking at me as if you were the only one of your kind destined to find a new owner today. Yes, I had already sampled a few of your friends, but none convinced me right away. You, in your inconspicuous yet striking attire, were desperate to be noticed. And then you overwhelmed me in a cloud of pure muscle power. The lady who sprayed you recommended you as a companion. Admittedly, she did that for all the others too, but she was right about you. And from then on, I carried you through my life for 2 years. Together, we met the first important woman and the first true love of my life, fought for months over her until the grand finale on a Spanish island, which we initially lost. The month after the finale opened new possibilities for us, and after drifting through Tokyo, we found ourselves on the home stretch. We triumphed as we leisurely drove through a desert with mountains full of eyes in a camper van, ultimately landing in a hostel... after which we accompanied the lady for 7 years until everything became incredibly complicated. You were not to blame - for the last 5 years, you just stood on the shelf watching everything go downhill. Since then, you have remained a third full, just as you have been since 2008, because I can only smell you every few months. And I don’t even need to press your cap. You may no longer accompany me, but you will always be by my side.

This fragrance overwhelms and completely engulfs everything around it. It casts all others into the shadows. It’s hard to believe that it’s supposed to be an EDT. I like to compare it to a scent from Christian D., also ""pour Homme Parfum"" (not Intense), which is no longer available and stands barely filled in my collection. However, there are differences in the base note, which for me can almost only be expressed by the term ""heaviness."" Gucci pour Homme is a bit heavier, albeit just slightly. Only very few, if any, oud fragrances can compete with it."
Gucci pour Homme,09/07/2013,Cappellusman,M,358,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,"But surely there can be more incense, right?","This must have been said multiple times by the marketing executives at Gucci to the poor perfumer; otherwise, I can't explain this scent...

I can already smell this ostentatiously oriental incense note in the top note, and then in the heart and base notes, I smell nothing else. Goodness, what was Gucci thinking? And - why is this scent so high up in the local charts?

The fragrance has illustrious ""relatives""; ""Gucci PH II""; yes, the ""tea scent,"" sensually subtle, it has real class, even if its longevity is pathetic. And yes - ""Gucci PH (1976),"" refined and unobtrusive. So why this incense monster?

For me, it is extremely ""unsubtle,"" intrusive, and completely dispensable; this exaggerated orientalism can be done better by Amouage, as they are more consistent.

The longevity, however, is epic, and the bottle is, of course, sensational, but that is by no means enough to compensate for my olfactory disappointment here.

I certainly do not want to intentionally ""diss"" or devalue a fragrance here, but rather warn members who might have considered a blind purchase and may want to rethink it now...

Those who enjoy incense in extreme doses may feel free to go for it; ""class"" and ""refinement"" look quite different..."
Gucci pour Homme,11/24/2015,Hedonist,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Warmer incense - where can you still find it?,"I have no emotional attachment to GPH.
I find the scent very pleasant, but I have only worn it a few times.
Especially outstanding for me is the wonderfully warm incense.
This incense is the defining element throughout the entire development,
so that I can hardly decipher all the other components of the pyramid. And yet it is so
perfectly integrated that it never stands alone, never dominates.
Feels good, and yet never ordinary.
It's a shame that it is no longer available.

So I started (like so many before me) to compare it with the
""similarly scented perfumes."" I would like to briefly outline my experiences here:

Potion:
During the first testing, it actually reminded me strongly of GPH, quite intuitively.
In direct comparison, however, you notice that it comes across as much sweeter and spicier,
more like Bentley for Men Intense. Less mature. Patchouli also cannot replace the incense.

Greyland:
The resinous note of cedarwood does indeed bring it close to GPH. However, it is too spicy and herbal, more fresh than warm.

Bentley for Men Absolute:
So far, it has the greatest similarity for me. The resin is more intense. When I first smell Bentley and then GPH, I can hardly perceive the latter anymore. Nevertheless, the similarity is astonishing.

Gucci pour Homme,12/17/2010,Stahl,M,20,,9,I like Kretek cigarettes...,"...whoever has ever smelled these clove cigarettes from Indonesia will either love or hate them - and will always recognize them! Gucci pour Homme is not quite as extreme, but it always reminds me of the scent of these cigarettes.
In general, it is a true spice scent - mainly Christmas spices (including Apicius' list) with a broad woody base and a very light sweetness, which makes the fragrance particularly suited for the current Christmas season and thus for Christmas markets. The only downside is the longevity: especially outdoors, the scent dissipates very quickly, so I have even found myself reapplying it in various perfumeries.

I cannot understand the discussion about the target audience. Of course, it is not a perfume for teens, but from the mid-20s onward, Gucci pour Homme is definitely wearable. It is more about the season - I generally only wear it in the cold months, preferably in November/December.

This scent simply gives me a warm, cozy feeling, and even while I am writing these lines, I catch myself sniffing it again and again. Strict or sacred darkness does not come to my mind at all - rather this image: Christmas Eve gathered with family around the Christmas tree. The fireplace provides comforting warmth, the candles are glowing, and the whole house smells of Christmas. Wishing you all a lovely pre-Christmas season!"
Gucci pour Homme,04/10/2013,Clyde,M,87,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,0,Ciao Bello!,"Gucci Pour Homme was already a small masterpiece that had a lot to offer and thus met all the demands one could have for a complete men's fragrance.

However, contrary to my expectations, there is no relation between the two Pour Homme (I and II); both fragrances go in completely different directions.
Gucci Pour Homme reminds me more of the legendary Santal Noble by Maître Parfumer et Gantier, which could ultimately be a sensible alternative, but unfortunately is quite hard to find and expensive.

I was all the more pleased about the rare opportunity to test this fragrance, as the fact that it was discontinued for inexplicable reasons must have disappointed most Gucci fans.

The opening of Gucci Pour Homme is alcoholic, sharp, and distinctly medicinal in nature, but only for the very first moments.
Actually, that's already a good sign, after all, not a few classic men's fragrances start in this tried-and-true, albeit seemingly unconventional way.
Anyone who looks a little closer at the listed ingredients can unmistakably sense that this must be an extremely spicy fragrance, but Gucci Pour is even more than that; it is more of a pure ""spice bomb""! Of course, one has to like that.

In this fragrance, all the aromatic substances have been so harmoniously integrated that it is difficult to break it down, and therefore it makes more sense to gain overall impressions.
Overall, Gucci Pour Homme is quite robust and spirited, coming across as significantly more masculine than its popular and worthy successor, Gucci Pour Homme II.
Associations with a subtle aroma reminiscent of almost Christmas-like fragrance oils cannot be entirely dismissed, but to categorize it solely in that time is unjustified, as it would also maintain its magnificent, long-lasting, and effective presence throughout the year.
However, considering the continuously declining quality of today's Gucci range, the discontinuation of Gucci Pour Homme is all the more incomprehensible.

A big Mille Grazie to ScentLover for the sample."
Gucci pour Homme,01/29/2010,Apicius,M,1328,,4,Not for me,"It's sitting around here and was more of a bad purchase.

Actually, it's a great spice scent for winter: clove, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg or something like that. I do like that, but the top note is quite strange. Pretty dark - herbal. I don't like it at all. I can't really say that anything about this perfume is bad, but I just don't like how it smells on me.

The almost identical scent without the irritating top note can be found in Héros by Uomo Parfums - Didier Calvo. But I believe it's no longer in production."

Even as a gift, I wouldn't have wanted this scent. After the first spray, it smelled to me only like a toilet! This scent is biting, penetrating. The sillage is very good; once

Gucci pour Homme,03/29/2013,Equestrian,M,3,,3,"Unfortunately, I don't have a photo for you today...","Oh, I wish so much that I could smell the fragrance facets described here. Unfortunately, I had significant difficulties from the very beginning and didn't dare to talk to anyone about it at first... At first, I thought of GPH as a strange isolated case that I couldn't explain. Then, gradually, I had opportunities to test various samples extensively and also ""fragrance twins"" like CDG 2 MAN or Potion.

Now, however, it becomes clear to me that my impression is not just an exception, as I experienced the same with all the mentioned samples: I can hardly perceive any fragrance notes at all, except for a piercing, biting chemical... I think of toxic gases, lighter fluid on steroids, something whose marketing is punishable under some EWG regulations. Do you remember from childhood when (*ahem* some people?!) found the smell of gasoline both repulsive and fascinating? It feels somewhat similar to me, except that the fascination isn't quite as strong, because the chemically-synthetic - pardon - smell takes center stage!

To all GPH fans and to all friends of qualified comments (I am one myself!!): Please excuse my statement, but perhaps we can agree on the added value of the comment in that it might be at least chemically interesting that this entire fragrance family behaves so extremely with me. The development of the fragrance essentially does not change either. Yes, it becomes a bit milder in between, and I can somewhat imagine what is meant here with jasmine and tonka (unfortunately, more is not possible), but then in the absolute drydown, the smell described above always remains, which is, by the way, perceptible for exactly 48 hours.

Can someone explain to me what is going on? Do I need to see a dermatologist? Otherwise, I really have the luck that perfumes last quite a long time on me, come across well, and I don't have any intolerances or allergies or anything... Is anyone else experiencing something similar??"
Gucci pour Homme,03/11/2010,Smelly,M,22,,0,For the Distinguished Gentleman,"Gucci pour Homme was the first perfume I acquired from the spicy-scented range. During the first testing, until then I only knew aquatic or citrus notes in the top notes, I actually had a wow effect. Perhaps that’s why it has remained one of my favorites.
In the meantime, I clearly prefer this fragrance direction (one does get older), but I still enjoy returning to Gucci Pour Homme within this group. For example, in direct comparison with The One by D&G, I find it not as unnecessarily sweet as the D&G product.
So: Not daily, not necessarily in the height of summer, but always very, very gladly."

Guilty,03/24/2012,Missk,F,1357,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,A not so 'guilty' fragrance,"Although I hate to say it, I find this fragrance one of the most overrated and over-promoted perfume releases of this year. To be honest, not many of Gucci's female fragrances have managed to impress me, (with Envy Me 2 being the only exception). I had some hope for Guilty, however I find it very bland.

I have no doubt that it will sell well, especially over this Christmas period, but it doesn't strike me as something that those 'naughty girls' or those particularly daring would choose to wear.

To my nose it's mostly sparkling fruits with a touch of spicy pink pepper. It has a pineapple juice quality in the opening, however it's not nearly as acidic as other pineapple based scents.

It's pleasant enough, yet incredibly boring, leaving me longing for something with much more depth. Where is that beautiful, earthy and green patchouli note that I so constantly crave in scents these days? There is so much missing from Guilty's composition.

It took me a while to be able to smell this fragrance seeing that it opens so subtly on the skin. It doesn't have much in the way of sillage I'm afraid, nor is the lasting power that of an impressive nature.

The name and the shiny gold bottle just doesn't seem befitting of this fragrance. It's misleading in the way it has been marketed as something elegant and formal, when it is in fact rather casual. It reminds me a little of Chanel's Coco Mademoiselle EDT.

There's not much else I can possibly add to this review. I'm disappointed and truly underwhelmed. It's predictable, but pleasant nonetheless.

This is a sweet warm fruity floral oriental on me. However it quickly becomes a mild skin scent and is totally gone by 3 hours so although I will enjoy my mini of it, I will not repurchase because of the low throw and short life.

It is a pleasent smell, one you would choose when not knowing what to wear or as a safe office scent. Sillage is low and longevity seems even worse. I can't say anything about the notes listed, which is it's quality maybe because the blend is subtle and seamless. This could be a lovely scent if it would perform, but is hardly does. Maybe it is called 'Guilty' because it's hiding :-)?

It is not a bad thing per se, now in my 30s I wouldnt mind wearing something like this and I don't think I am old or anything like that, but we all know how smells work in our brain and I cant avoid to make the asociation with older women in a way it makes me imagine a single mother who didnt want to be a mother but she is following the expectations of their burgoise boring and autoritative family, for once tyring to be sexy again wearing a dress for a party after a long time of having an stressful life, I don't know how to describe it. Damn, I hate the description I have made but this is the image it evoques in me T.T

Lilac is the colour I see the most here, but diluted into a lot of hair spry. It is heavy and airy at the same time.

It is a very elegant perfume, but also very serious and a little boring. I don't know why but also the fragrance it is pleasant and on paper felt special, on my skin it didnt make me feel anything beautiful or pleasant. It is so serious and with a touch of arrogance that is a sad perfume trying to be elegant so hard that fails to me"
Guilty,05/06/2025,Xavica,F,311,,2,Guilty of Trying Too Hard,"At first, Guilty comes across as a simple, powdery floral - almost too basic. There's nothing extraordinary about it, just a fragrance that stays in the safe, familiar zone.

But as it develops, a fruity note starts to emerge. Unfortunately, this fruitiness doesn’t turn out to be the juicy, refreshing kind; instead, it takes on a harsh, almost overripe quality, like a fruit that’s stayed too long in the sun. It seems like the peach is to blame for this misstep.

In the end, it didn’t win me over. Gucci Guilty aspires to be elegant and refined, but it feels stuck somewhere between trying to be sophisticated and coming off as a little forced. A nice try, but not quite a success."
Guilty,07/16/2025,Purl,F,32,,1,Reminds me of 90s scents,"It smells like someone mixed Curve and J'Ador. This is sweet fruity, floral. I see lilac listed as the main note but I'm not really smelling it at all. The patchouli and amber take a while to appear but they're soft and nicely done. Sometimes I feel like they can be overpowering.

The branding makes it sound like it's sultry and sexy, but is the standard HS locker room post-gym class smell from 1995-2010, just with a Gucci price tag."

This has definitely become a go to of mine when I want to smell like success and portray a sexy goddess. You will not overpower the room, but people will smell you...experience you....remember you.

Guilty,12/08/2017,PiaMia,F,12,,21,Eau de Innocent Lamb,"The confession:
I don't actually own this fragrance myself - but my dear mom does. Every time I stand in her bathroom, I eye her collection: Chanel Eau de Parfum - a timeless classic, J'adore by Dior - wonderfully elegant, and of course Guilty by Gucci (these are just a few, after all, I inherited my love for perfumes from her). So I sprayed the fragrance on myself and was more than surprised.

The description of the culprit:
As some have already reported, this perfume smells anything but ""guilty."" I expected everything, just not this soft, light lilac cloud that now surrounds me. As Mahatma1951 described so well in her great comment - who would consider someone who smells like this to be guilty? Because the fragrance has no edges, nothing wicked, and nothing polarizing (I can imagine that it is perceived as pleasant by many noses). The perfume itself is beautifully composed and truly smells very harmonious, well-groomed, and incredibly feminine. The aforementioned lilac undoubtedly dominates here and envelops you for several hours in a warm and soft, but rather intimate sillage. For this reason, I find it absolutely suitable for the office and everyday wear, as it has nothing intrusive in my nose. It would also work for dates, but only if you have arranged a puzzle night (;

Final plea:
One must not take the name at face value and buy it blindly if one expects a scent worthy of a sexy femme fatale on the stand. Because it is the exact opposite: agreeable, unobtrusive, soft, sweet, and cuddly - just like a little innocent lamb."

Objection!!!!
Guilty has indeed committed a crime, yes!! Absolutely....
Guilty of causing confusion with its name,
guilty of being pleasing,
guilty of being arbitrary,
guilty of being beautiful,
guilty of being wonderful,
guilty of being the perfect office scent.

One cannot accuse it of triviality; that can undoubtedly be refuted.

It relies solely on its charm to captivate as many people as possible. For this, it brings nothing but its lovely tones into play and shows no sophistication, which it doesn't even need.
A hint of fruitiness paired with sweet lilac nuances defines its character, only interrupted by soft creamy amber tones and a minimal pepper note, with underlying patchouli streaks. It comes across as floral-fruity, buoyant, bright, friendly, and always well-groomed.

Anyone with so much charm doesn't need to resort to tricks.
To accuse it of triviality is simply wrong.

So what can be held against it?
Only its longevity and sillage. They are simply too low.

The scent is nice. Not at all Gucci-Pucci. No ostentatious sweetness, nothing baroque, nothing screaming. No, a very pleasant representative of the ""light"" kind: Radiant, clean, friendly. Sparkling mandarin, floral white-fleshed peach on harmless patchouli. Quite sexy in a clean way.

Okay: My must-have-it-now center doesn’t kick in. I’m not burning with hot love, I’m not racing with tunnel vision to the next fragrance temple. However, if someone were to casually throw it at me, I would wear it gratefully and happily.

The pink pepper is gentle and lively, sparking a desire for outings in the greenery, where fragrant lilac trees sway in the wind.
Amber rounds out the scent, making it shiny, like the mild April sun that illuminates this spring idyll.

Meanwhile, disappointment hides behind a beautiful bottle, which I really like, feels pleasant in the hand, and deserves a better content.

The cute mandarin top note flashes briefly, and the pepper has probably been forgotten in some spice rack for years. No trace of aroma left. Then it gets a bit floral-powdery, and the uninspired base note announces itself, which doesn’t impress but at least stays on the skin for a while. However, nothing else happens, so waiting is pointless.

Guilty,08/20/2011,Kittycat,F,280,,17,Defense of an Innocent,"""Guilty"" by Gucci, accused of boredom, mediocrity, pretentiousness, and low longevity, is hereby officially defended by me with this comment.

The accused is by no means as bad as its reputation, quite the opposite. The following points speak in favor of the fragrance:

The top note impresses with gourmand freshness, mandarin and pepper add a kick.

Lilac is rarely found so well and harmoniously embedded in a fragrance (without coming across as soliflore), especially since a great effect is achieved with delicate peach.

The accusers from the Parfumo community have fallen for the saying that not all that glitters is gold. This is certainly true, but in this case, it is hard to accuse the defendant of not looking attractive. Just because it has a striking appearance does not mean it lacks inner values.

The longevity is only as good as the user is able to handle the fragrance. That means spraying generously in hair and on clothing or moisturizing the skin beforehand - this way the scent also delivers what it promises. In any case, Guilty!

I therefore request that the innocent Gucci fragrance be acquitted of all charges and that the verdict be reconsidered. Thank you for your attention ;-)"

Guilty,05/19/2013,Mandelmaus,F,132,,13,We all just want one thing...,"... and Gucci is certainly aware of this. Who doesn't want to be beautiful, desirable, and sexy? ""Sex sells"" seems to be the motto guiding the advertising campaign here, trying to lure us in. The advertisement suggests that with this scent, one transforms into an irresistible, passionate Femme Fatale. And then it’s even called ""Guilty."" With low expectations, I delve into it.

After a moderately strong smell of alcohol dissipates, the scent starts off rather dull. A lonely slice of mandarin, which seems somewhat synthetic, carelessly garnished with a few peppercorns. The fragrance is fruity here, unfortunately unnatural and sweet. There’s only a minimal hint of pepper, too little to attribute it with the descriptor spicy. After a few minutes, patchouli begins to shimmer through the previously inconsequential fragrance mix, cautiously steering towards an oriental direction. Already better, yet not guilty. Lilac adds pleasant powdery and creamy accents, contributing a soft, cuddly, feminine note. It’s becoming increasingly floral, as another bloom seems to be joining in. However, it is too vague for me to name it specifically. The peach surprises me positively, completely velvety and warm, with no trace of scratchy fruit sweetness. Well, it is sweet in a positive sense. It’s supposed to symbolize a forbidden fruit. The femininity here is more flirtatious than wicked, very cuddly and playful. Amber creates a rich, soft bed on which the notes roll around gracefully. Nothing with complete loss of control and overwhelming sensuality. After about five to six hours, I find only a spicy hint of patchouli on my skin, paired with a delicate lilac and peach note.

All in all, I find Guilty not bad. Over time, I like it more and more and it gives me a comforting feeling. It envelops me in a creamy, powdery, fruity, and floral scent cloud with a touch of oriental. Nicely done, but why this name? With Guilty, I don’t strut around swinging my hips, tossing my hair provocatively over my shoulder with the absolute certainty that my eyes resemble green laser cannons, instantly captivating my willing prey. And he would do nothing more than be my captive for a night. Okay, that was exaggerated :-D

If the longevity and sillage were better, I would even consider a purchase. Aside from sports and in great heat, one could wear the scent for many occasions. I like the floral-fruity-powdery creaminess. And a woman who feels good in her skin and is aware of her positive aura should never be underestimated.

The advertisement promises something sinful, erotic, which the name also suggests. But unfortunately, only the price is a sin.
The scent is lilac and a few other minor notes, not worth mentioning. Now I've been wearing it for almost 4 hours, and if you get your nose really close, you can still smell a tiny bit of it.
At least the bottle is beautifully designed.

Guilty is harmless and nice, it doesn't hurt anyone. It is unobtrusive and well-behaved, so you can wear it daily when nothing better comes to mind. It's not bad, but it's miles away from making a big impression on me. You're right if you think it fits better in a drugstore.
The pepper is cowardly, hiding behind the mandarin. Peach, lilac, yes, present. Everything feels a bit artificial, but okay. In the base, Guilty becomes creamy, soft with amber. Patchouli joins in hesitantly.
The bottle looks like it could appeal to teenagers who want something from Gucci.
There are a few southern girls living near me who always wear thick makeup, their eyes painted black. They wear fake designer clothes and try to make everything look expensive. Guilty fits in well there.

A great scent that is sexy, elegant, interesting, warm, and sensual. I really enjoy wearing this fragrance and feel very comfortable with it. The longevity is also very good. Whenever I think the scent has completely faded, the next time I ""sniff,"" one or another note reappears."
Guilty,08/25/2012,UnicornCoco,F,374,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Romantic and Elegant,"With the word ""heartfelt"" one could describe the scent quite well, I think. You can hardly smell the mandarin; instead, the lilac quickly and intensely comes to the forefront. The peach also comes through nicely and adds a pleasant sweetness that makes the perfume so romantic and soft.
A slight woody note keeps ""Guilty"" from drifting into the cheesy or boring. Rather, it is a very elegant scent that I find extremely successful.
Two male friends (20) of mine also liked it, as they found it unobtrusive and pleasant."
Guilty,08/30/2012,Baarbie,F,16,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,great love,"I must confess, I love this perfume; I can't quite say why, I just feel incredibly comfortable when I wear it.
It surrounds me all day, like a veil it wraps around my skin, very delicate yet present..
The chemistry between us is just right, as I often get compliments on this scent..
As boring as many find it, it can't be that dull :)
On me, it smells stunning, elegant, sensual, delicate.
Unfortunately, this wonderful feeling doesn't last long, as it fades after 5 hours."
Guilty,06/12/2013,Cloeed,F,10,,5,Pretty sexy,"I sniffed a sample abroad and was torn. Buy it or not?! Back here in Germany, I really kicked myself because it hadn't been released yet.
A month later, I called it mine: a lush fragrance, I like to wear it in winter or in the evening, it's too much for summer.
It's not wild and ""roar,"" but it wears nicely and lingers in the nose with a high recognition value.
I really like it!"
Guilty,03/11/2011,Secret,F,43,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,very average,"I really like the bottle, it looks elegant and expensive.
But the scent itself is... well... sweet, floral, and a bit herbally oriental...
I actually like patchouli, but here it's just not blended that well... it also smells kind of oddly powdery somehow... I can't really describe it ;)
I don't find Guilty particularly terrible, but it's not outstanding either... just so-so... it also depends on my mood, sometimes I even think Guilty is quite nice ;)
But in general, this scent is probably not a hit. It smells nice and is generally okay, but nothing special..."

And I thought to myself: Please, please, smell only half as good as your name says you do!
Bääängggggg! - Giant frying pan on my head when I first had the scent in my nose! Dream shattered.
Yaaa... now I need to collect myself and report on how it smells: Honestly, I can't say - I can't really pick out any of the notes mentioned above. Sweet, yes, and a bit oriental. But not successfully oriental... and also not successfully sweet.

I find it terrible, intrusive, and very ordinary. In no way convincing.

I can't understand how it could rise so high on the popularity scale???!

Unfortunately, there isn't much special about Guilty either... But we shouldn't punish this mainstream scent.
Top notes of grapefruit, red mandarin, and bergamot?, a hint of cassis and juicy peach, with pineapple? In terms of floral notes, I believe in jasmine or tiaré (lilac? mmm but which color, not the white?). Possibly alongside the red pepper, a bit of ginger? Wood?: patchouli with cedarwood and a lot of sweet amber musk.
We perfume enthusiasts are the scent freaks, and Guilty is therefore too nice..."
Guilty,03/21/2013,Tooodschick,F,49,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,More innocent than wicked.,"Gucci Guilty is not a bad scent. I own it myself and am quite satisfied with it. Nevertheless, for me, it is a very simple sweet, slightly oriental everyday fragrance for the colder seasons. In the advertising, this scent is portrayed as ""wild."" In reality, it smells rather tame. I wouldn't describe it as boring, but it lacks that certain something. The longevity is good. All in all, I can really recommend the fragrance. Not as an incredibly wicked evening scent, but as an everyday fragrance for the cooler months. Those who enjoy something a bit sweeter and warmer will surely find joy in this little gem."
Guilty,08/09/2023,Sq223,F,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,My Heart's Fragrance,"First of all: I am referring to the version in the 'old' bottle that was released in 2010. And I do not understand the average rating at all.

I still remember very well the purchase of my first 'real' perfume: Gucci Guilty!
I associate very beautiful days with this scent. Back then, I was a fresh high school graduate. As a gift, I got to spend 3 weeks abroad in the Emirates with my uncle. With a bit of pocket money, one day I went shopping, and I bought this wonderful fragrance.
It was around springtime and already very hot in the Emirates. My daily routine consisted of: exercising, sunbathing, showering, and then: applying this fragrance.
Even after my time with my uncle, this scent accompanied me for a long time and brought me many compliments; it seemed to harmonize very well with my own chemistry. Since then, I have been searching for a comparable fragrance that brings about the same effect and I also mourn the old formulation of Gucci Guilty... the original version has unfortunately been discontinued.

For me, this scent is a go-to. On hot days, I am enveloped in a cloud of lilac, patchouli, pink pepper, and amber. The patchouli and amber, as well as the rose, give the fragrance the oriental notes that make it wearable even in winter. The pepper and mandarin add a slight spiciness and freshness.

This fragrance has given me many beautiful moments, and I cherish my last 'original' bottle.

(Fyi: the Intense version still has the old bottle, but I find the edt version better in terms of scent. Unfortunately, I do not like the scent in the 'new' bottle at all...)"

What more do we have to endure? Isn't it enough already with the mediocrity, lack of creativity, greed? YES!
Not only does the bottle remind me so strikingly of the ...something-Me line from Escada, but the scent is just as boring in the base.
More than what Omara says about it, I can't really think of anything else. The fragrances I'm criticizing here are all not bad. But interchangeable. And definitely too expensive. For the price of an MB, you only get a Smart.
No, I'd rather stick with my Custom-Rods."
Guilty,01/17/2024,Justinexst,F,9,,6,Must Have,"For a long time, this fragrance passed me by, but eventually, I stopped and gave it a chance. Before, I resisted because it seemed too mainstream to me.

Guilty,03/30/2025,Elejna,F,4,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Love Story,"Many years ago it happened - a moment so magical and unique that it changed my heart forever. I fell in love. For fourteen years now, our love has stood the test of all the ups and downs of life, unwavering and full of devotion. It is that rare, almost fairy-tale love that the most beautiful novels speak of - a love that does not fade with time, but only grows deeper and more intense.

And just as our love blossoms in all its facets, this fragrance unfolds as well - a delicate melody of flowers and longing. A hint of lilac and rose wafts through the air, gentle yet full of passion, as if petals were dancing on a warm summer breeze. No trace of pepper - just a fine, sweet freshness that reminds one of the innocence of days gone by. Like the sparkling sweetness of a children's lemonade in an old film, warm and full of comfort. The violet finally rises with lovely elegance, rounding off the fragrance experience into a gentle, almost dreamlike harmony.

It is not just a fragrance - it is a memory, a feeling, a love letter to time, to the past, and to all that is yet to come."
Guilty,01/18/2011,DieNase,F,186,,3,"Looks great on the outside, but what's inside?","The bottle looks really cool, at least in the picture. I haven't seen it in real life yet.
I'm finding it hard to rate. The sample is almost empty, so I guess I didn't find it that bad. It's relatively sweet, which isn't really my thing. I think it leans a bit towards an oriental gourmand direction. For a sweet scent, it doesn't annoy me that much. I can imagine it well for going out and that it would appeal to the male gender. I would see it more on younger ladies and during club visits rather than on a settled woman or at the opera. The younger crowd might find it sexy, but in my opinion, it's not elegant.
It's not for me, but I don't think it's that bad."
Envy for Men,02/05/2012,Missk,F,1357,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Envious that this is not marketed to women,"I bought this fragrance just the other day when I was out shopping for a cologne for my boyfriend. I had tested many male scents that day, however this one stood out amongst the rest.

To be completely honest, I think I liked this fragrance because I could see myself wearing it. It had this alluring, dark and spicy sweetness that captivated me almost immediately.

The sales assistant actually agreed with me that this fragrance could easily be unisex on the right woman. I believe that I am the woman that can succeed in wearing Envy.

Envy for Men opens with peppery orange, lavendar and rich mahogany. The top notes also have a slight menthol smell which is possibly brought to mind due to the intense green colour of the juice itself. The ginger is really lovely in this fragrance as in most cases ginger can make or break a scent.

In the heart the sweetness becomes more apparent with the carnation, jasmine and rose hinting that this fragrance is suitable for women as well.

The drydown is amazing. Vanilla, incense, patchouli, amber and tobacco creating a smokey and almost exotic scent. It is a delight to snuggle up to someone wearing this fragrance as it is both soothing and arousing.

I had every intention of giving this fragrance to my boyfriend for his birthday, however now I seem to be changing my mind. I am almost decided on keeping this fragrance for myself and finding him something else to wear or suggesting to him that we could possibly share."
Envy for Men,06/19/2014,jtd,M,484,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,art direction,"I've dogged Tom Ford's perfumes. I'm not a great fan of his eponymous perfume line, but on smelling Gucci Envy for Men, something clicked.  The Gucci perfumes of the Ford era were a first rate line of designer perfumes and are a testament to the value of art direction.

Gucci Rush is a pitch-perfect modern example of the pursuit of beauty in classical perfumery. It's gorgeous, it stops you in your tracks, it makes you think.  

I have a love-hate relationship with Gucci Envy, but then again I hold ambiguity in very high regard. A perfume that polarizes opinions points to a strong artistic voice. One that splits an individual’s own opinions is ingenious.  

Gucci pour Homme I (Michel Almairac, 2003) was a thoughtful, beautiful perfume released at a time of big perfume ad campaigns followed by even bigger yawns. I doubt that a Gucci perfume was launched without a high degree of gloss, but in this case the proof was in the pudding. In fact, whether GpH I started the trend of beautiful woody incense perfumes for men, it certainly became the leader of the trend mainstream market.

Gucci Eau de Parfum and Gucci Eau de Parfum II reflect a brilliant strategy of letting the blandness of the market serve as a backdrop. Seen against a group-think market of women’s perfumes in the 1990s, they stand out both for ingenuity and for their beauty.

Gucci Eau de Parfum is a strikingly simple floral Oriental writ large that rose above the monochromatic mob of syrupy gourmands. It offered an old-school animalic quality to women who had been lead to believe that the height of beauty was to smell like a cupcake, sprinkles and all.

Gucci Eau de Parfum II was a subversive little beauty that infiltrated the fruity-floral genre, skipping the spoonful of sugar in favor of a tart woodiness. Gucci edp II has none of the frivolity and triteness typically associated with the genre. Its pokerface and assuredness give it a character more like a classic woody such as Jean Patou 1000.

Envy for Men didn't bust down any walls, and unless quality comes as a surprise to you, it doesn't shock. It's the spicy, woody, resinous perfume equivalent of a Russian male choir. A large range is covered, but the rumbling bass is what I remember. A lot has been made of its nutmeg and ginger notes being its defining attributes, but like Givenchy Insénsé, whose floral notes have been touted as the reason for the perfume's failure to breech the men's market, the note isn't the coup de grace. Beauty is.

Many men fear unadulterated, or better, unmodulated beauty, and despite its nominal set of 'masculine' notes (lavender, cedar, incense, amber...) Envy for Men is luxuriously beautiful. It's like many of the Amouage masculines such as Gold Man (1983) and Dia pour Homme (2002) where the goal is explicitly for a man to smell beautiful. The litany of questions that often curtail men actually wearing a perfume are irrelevant. (Is it an 'office scent'? Does it broadcast easy identification with your cohort? Could it be perceived as feminine?). If you look closely, Envy for Men easily passes masculine muster, and should assuage the fear behind these questions. It should simply have been seen as a handsome, distinctive entry into the market. But men's deep-seated fear of appearing beautiful trumps the rest, and, despite something of a cult following, Envy for men has gone the way of much of the other Ford era Guccis. It's been discontinued.

Perfume fans follow the work of individual perfumers. Why not branch out a bit and follow the work of the art director? If the perfumer can be likened to the director in film, the art director is somewhere between the film producer (eg. Serge Lutens) and the art curator (eg. Frédéric Malle.) Larger-scale commercial perfumery relies on a consensus model that defines creativity very narrowly.

The Gucci line of the Ford era is similar to the Estée Lauder perfumes made during Lauder’s time. The ridiculous lie of the Lauder line during Estee Lauder's lifetime was that she made each of her perfumes herself. Lauder was known for producing a spectacular line that didn’t shy away from polarizing opinion. Azurée, Knowing, Aliage, Estée. And her perfumes for men, principally in the Aramis line, are still the best compilation of masculine fragrances from a large commercial cosmetic/perfume producer. If she had openly proclaimed herself as an art director of the line, she'd have beaten Lutens and Malle to the punch by decades.

If you're interested in looking at perfume from the perspective of the art director instead of the perfumer or an entire line, take a look at the Gucci perfumes by Tom Ford. Some are discontinued, and some are still in production, but they're all fairly easy to find."
Envy for Men,11/24/2015,Lucian,M,12,,4,overrated,"I love Envy, actually it was my signature fragrance when it was released. I had 2 bottles, the yellowish green and the reformulated electric green juice. First formulation was better.

But even with all the nostalgia I will not re-buy this fragrance. It's hard to get and the prices are just ridiculous.

If you're not an Arab prince don't bother seeking this fragrance out, you can get so many better colognes at a fair price right now. One example will be Bentley Intense.

Performances are just average and the compliment factor is pretty low, to be honest. The vintage snobs will say this is a holly grail, just because they have it and you don't.

So don't believe the hype, and just forget about Envy.
RIP"
Envy for Men,04/27/2021,Denim86,M,19,,4,Back when they knew how to do it,"This is the epitome when it comes Down to, how to make a good fragrance overall, not just a designer.

This was/is perfect still. Just stunning. . And performance is outstanding. Happy to own a 2005 bottle."
Envy for Men,10/20/2014,MasterLi,M,376,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,A discontinued emerald green jewel of a fragrance...,"What a fantastic fragrance this was! A spicy oriental full of ginger, incense, cedarwood and sandalwood... and a gorgeous smell to match! The very definition of an oriental with woods!

Stylish bottle, classic green juice... a prominent incense vibe. In my mind this is like standing in the middle of a Chinese Temple... sandalwood and jasmine incense burning, an almost menthol-like aroma of Chinese herbs and spices. Envy for Men opened up with incense and sandalwood, followed by lavender, ginger, pepper, cardamom and coriander seed. With a sweet & spicy amber and vanilla drydown in the base. What wasn't there to like? It had everything you could want from an oriental for men! Class, sophistication, a faint aura of mystery & seduction... this is more than most fragrances can offer thesedays!

It really is a shame that Gucci discontinued all the outstanding and daring work Tom Ford produced whilst he had full creative control of the company. He built Gucci up like a Phoenix from it's ashes, and now it has lost what set it apart from other designer brands. It lost it's bold creativity and most of all, it's uniqueness in terms of fragrances.

This is a gem of a fragrance, and I will cherish what little I have left of this juice in memory of this once great brand. R.I.P. Envy... you sexy green devil!"
Envy for Men,08/07/2020,Pepdal,M,238,,2,Designer envy,I don't often get a chance to review discontinued scents that have such a storied reputation as this one. Luckily people's generosity knows no bounds and i could get my nose on this one. Hope you enjoy the review and find it helpful.

Now, I didn’t pay the ridiculous eBay prices for it, but it was still a kick in the wallet. Why did I spend all that money on a 10+ year old eau de toilette? Well, that’s a long story. I’m of the mind that this is perhaps one of the greatest male fragrances ever..."

That was a big mistake, as it actually is a great spicy oriental with ginger as a primary note. I may prefer Floris Eau de Santal and Eau de Santal Extreme that have a similar dry-down, but Gucci was first and deserves credit for paving the way... Oh, and it smells great in its own right. Those who enjoy ginger based spicy orientals can stop here after trying this one. 3.5 to 4 stars out of 5."

That being said, it's rather formal and not something you'd wear to work or at the movies. Be warned though, not much development going on here, rather linear fragrance. Really good stuff, but try it before you waste insane amounts on a bottle from the Bay, which seems to be one of the last places to get your hands on this discontinued pleaser. At the original price of 40$ this was decently priced, but now...

If you're looking for something with a similar vibe, I'd recommend Prada Amber Pour Homme Intense."

If you want to have a piece of history in your hands, as well as around your neck, be prepared to spend some money! If you know the right people, it can be done cheaper!"
Envy for Men,01/28/2017,Can777,M,257,,19,Envy!..........,"One of the seven deadly sins.
To pale with envy, to be consumed by envy, or to turn green with envy.
Envy, also known as jealousy, is a sin that drags many others along with it.
Typically, anger, resentment, and bitterness soon follow. In the worst stage, acedia follows,
also known as sloth,...the soul begins to dissolve.
The seven deadly sins slumber in all of us; I have personally become well acquainted with some of them and have gladly allowed them in,...I confess!
But since I have been living according to the rules of Buddhism for a long time, they are well under control.

Envy,..Envy was the first fragrance from the house of Gucci launched under the new leadership of Tom Ford. Under the new direction of head designer Tom Ford, Gucci was propelled to unprecedented heights, awakening from its dusty and deep slumber.
Although Daniela Andrier was responsible for Envy, Tom Ford was significantly involved in its development,..which is inevitably recognizable.
Envy was extremely masculine, sexy, and very lascivious,..the envy was, in the truest sense,..green!
When it was released, it sold out in no time; now it lived up to its name, as people were envious of those who managed to get a bottle.
Wearing Envy, one was inevitably approached about it,..a true Tom Ford!

Envy opens the sin with mandarin and pepper, initially slightly spicy-fruity with faint hints of cardamom and anise.
After half an hour, Envy begins to change, and you can feel how the sin slowly rises within you.
Clove spreads out, and nuances of musk, opoponax, and jasmine surround you, alternately vying for dominance.
Envy surrenders to the full sin in the final accord.
Vanilla, amber, and soft suede with a small sin of vetiver make Envy uniquely striking and sexy.

Envy has a very good longevity of 12 hours even with the smallest dosage. The sin does not fade away quickly.
Its sillage is strong, but not loud, and is above average.
Envy is often quite obvious.

Conclusion
A fragrance that created the atmosphere of a humid, steamy, and mossy jungle floor in
me and lets its surroundings partake in it.
Very masculine and seductive for both genders, with a distinctly Tom Ford note even at that time.
One of the milestones of the house of Gucci and still contemporary and extremely attractive today.

Since I have been free from envy and jealousy my whole life, this sin could never harm me, but there were plenty of other deadly sins that had far more chances with me... anger, for example, but with a few prayers, that one passes quickly too.
Pssst: But it doesn't always help!"
Envy for Men,04/23/2011,TAAKE,M,22,,24,"""Grace surrounds elegance and adorns it.""","A business fragrance as it should be! Gucci Envy for men is a blockbuster, this scent is synonymous with all the translations of a single English keyword: SOPHISTICATED!

Here, wonderfully spicy, peppery, and zesty notes are combined with a beautifully oriental fragrance accord without becoming even remotely loud. At the beginning, pepper and ginger dominate, presenting a very potent yet unobtrusive play of freshness, a non-sweet mandarin can be sensed, a soft, warm hint of anise and cardamom envelops the overall picture, and vanilla is already gently pushing to the surface in soft intervals after a very short time.

There is a very warm freshness, a refined interplay of zesty summer scent and oriental feel-good atmosphere - an extraordinary semi-gourmand companion that whispers softly: ""Here I am!"" Gucci Envy for men inevitably stands out from the crowd with its sophisticated and cosmopolitan aura, doing so with great subtlety and unmistakable elegance. A wonderful, high-class fragrance for the cultivated man.

The green potion in its distinctive, masculine bottle is the perfect companion for meetings & co in business attire and a very good friend for the hours afterward in the hotel lounge. It makes itself comfortable on a dark leather couch in dim light, enjoying tobacco and cognac, and lets the evening end stylishly and relaxed.

Gucci Envy for men certainly hasn't reinvented the wheel, it doesn't belong in the niche fragrance category, yet it is still different from all its brothers and sisters. This scent surprises without overwhelming!

The longevity is very good, but one should be sparing with the dosage and proceed with caution. A downside is the enormous dependence on individual skin chemistry, where surprises can often end negatively. Gucci Envy for men, like many other fragrance jewels, has unfortunately been taken off the market despite good sales figures and without understandable reasons. I have not found a scent even remotely comparable to it to this day. Here, too, a great master of perfumery, Maurice Roucel, had his hands involved (despite the lack of mention).

CONCLUSION: Those who enjoy gourmand notes that do not overwhelm should test Gucci Envy for men; those who count long-lasting and differentiated perfumes among their preferences will feel at home here, and those looking for a demanding, refined fragrance for serious occasions should secure an artifact of the green envy water, because (to quote Cornelius Nepos): ""Envy is the companion of fame."""
Envy for Men,09/21/2014,FabianO,M,1008,,17,"Gucci's male milestone - Coriander-spiced mandarin and leathery, vanilla wood in pure harmony","It has always been on my watchlist. It’s been 14 years since I acquired a (then quite generously sized) 4.5 ml sample by purchasing Fahrenheit or something similar, shortly after the release of ""Envy"".

I have never owned more than this sample - but it was my choice on my very first date back then. And that date also led to my first girlfriend in my teenage years..

I was already aware that the scent radiates something special - but I never thought of buying more than the 4.5 ml. And today, having acquired a decant again and tested it after 12 years, I kick myself for not having fully enjoyed the real existence of ""Envy"".

In short: For me, Gucci's absolute best! I also like ""Gucci I"" and ""Gucci II"", no question - but what the brand has achieved with this men's fragrance in the black-dark green monolithic bottle surpasses all the others noticeably.

A dark fruity, coriander-spiced mandarin dominates the start - the complexity is already evident in the fragrance pyramid, which positions a true orchestra in the top notes - fine, powdery pepper alongside unusually early hints of soft, spicy rosewood nuances round off the start in a complex manner.

Everything is already underlaid with a soft, masculine woodiness that has an extremely strong presence. The more autumnally green flowers of the heart phase sensualize the spicy opening and evoke associations with a brighter, greener ""Antaeus"".

The base then transitions into a still softly woody, slightly vanilla leather that exudes an incredible masculine calm and comfort.

A truly great, artistic, incredibly charismatic fragrance milestone.

If Gucci were to (please, please!) reissue it - I would probably stock up on it until I’m 80 years old..."
Envy for Men,08/15/2020,HJK63,M,1,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,I miss you ...,"Right off the bat: If I were to wear a fragrance for the rest of my days, it would be Envy for Men. I have never encountered a scent with which I felt more in harmony. You don't have to understand it, but that's how it is. If I remember correctly, the first version was more yellow, then came a pale green, and finally a strong green. According to my fragrance memory, the ginger in the top note and the sandalwood in the drydown were much more dominant in the first version than in its successors. If I had known back then how much I would miss Envy for Men today, I would have acted like Helmut Schmidt, who allegedly hoarded Reyno menthol cigarettes in his cellar before they were banned. Be that as it may, missed opportunity. Today, I only own a quarter-full bottle of the second generation, and I guard it like my own eye, because I won't participate in the bidding madness for remaining stocks. By the way, my first Envy for Men bottle was a gift and initially caused me to shake my head: ""I’m not going to walk around with a fragrance that I constantly have to think about being called 'envy'."" However, after the first spray, that intention went out the window. By the way: In search of a fragrance twin to Envy for Men, I briefly landed on the recommendation of Floris Santal and Carven Homme. Unfortunately, both are at best distant relatives, but definitely not twins for me. So I continue to sniff my way through the fragrance landscape in search of the holy grail that Envy for Men was for me."
Envy for Men,05/04/2014,Leimbacher,M,2870,,17,Egg swings whenever & wherever you want - or: Style only looks like arrogance from below,"I have been hunting for this one for a long time - and now I've found it through a nice perfume from Italy. Of course, it is more expensive than it was 4 years ago in stores, but still affordable, and who could have guessed back then that soon moon prices would be demanded on eBay. Now I no longer have to look at owners and fans with envy; I also have a 100 ml bottle and can join the conversation. It is definitely worth its 100€ (1€ per ml), back then for half the price it was one of the best deals on the market.

The scent has everything that most new releases lack: eggs, courage, charisma, punch, a recognizable style, and purpose. Much of this we owe once again to Tom Ford, who had a hand in this. I would even go so far as to place it on the same level as today's bestsellers and recognized top perfumes from his line - like Sahara Noir, Black Orchid, or Extreme. Tabacco Vanille might be a bit of a stretch, but that's also a different weight/price class, and the leap isn't that far either. In my opinion, the Private Line contains more super noble scents for special occasions. In contrast, Envy Men can be worn anytime and anywhere (as long as it’s not too hot) and can become the go-to scent. You just need a bit thicker eggs than the average, meaning self-confidence - but that can partly be trained.

Envy Men most reminds me of the very good Michael Kors Michael For Men, just greener and a bit more old-school. But it is clear that this old-school barbershop feeling is intentional and more of a modern homage and interpretation - like so much with Mr. Ford, in memory of the good old days.

Envy starts with a smoky-green masculinity chaos. Shaving meets vanilla, retro meets future, incense meets Green Berlin. A real scent for the boss - not the little boss. The scent is also spicy and gentle. Lavender brings a calming effect and makes the scent come across as laid-back and egg-swinging - without truly appearing arrogant. Just determined and cool - I'm sexy & I know it! A slightly leathery undertone also contributes to this sexy attitude. Simply super versatile and super popular - in the worst case, it comes off okay, never bad. But you have to be prepared for the scent to be potent and thick, so you should apply it sparingly, and at over 15 degrees, you might want to reach for a lighter scent. Green, leathery, spicy, heavy, oriental - a real wonder package. It's a shame that not more people get to test it.

Bottle: classic, masculine, bulky - but Gucci still does that well today. But as everyone knows, the scents have degraded much more significantly.
Sillage: strong, thick, confident, knows what it can do and wants.
Longevity: easily lasts the whole egg-swinging day.

A great scent, far above designer average, unjustly in the shadow of its 2 brothers (Gucci PH I+II), and a shame that it has been discontinued. Anyone who thinks the new Gucci scents aren't as bad as everyone says: please test Envy, and Guilty and Co's eggs will shrink to raisins."
Envy for Men,09/15/2010,MaxFavier,M,6,,20,Little Green Goblin,"I stumbled upon Gucci Envy one morning in the lost time between two seminars. I actually just wanted to kill some time in the perfume shop; in the end, I walked out with a broad grin, trailing a green perfume cloud behind me through the pedestrian zone. After another unsuccessful attempt to find something positive in the male Chanel -Egoiste and Allure-, the toxic green bottle from Gucci caught my eye in the perfume shop. A spray on the blotter: Envy is outrageous. At its core, a wild mix of cheap herbal drugstore perfume, vanilla sauce, and sprinkled ginger dust, the result is somehow so wonderfully extravagant that the top notes completely blow me away. A sweet mixture of spices that I can't quite identify, very nicely done, but certainly not for everyone. Unfortunately, the drydown is rather disappointing, an old-fashioned green perfume with vanilla - this could have been done better and more high-quality. While the beginning is still youthful, the base tends strongly towards the over-50 direction.
Envy is not a subtle perfume; rather, it’s a spicy-green raucous “Hey, here I come” in sweet vanilla sauce. You certainly won't find any understatement here. Envy wants to be loud, intrusive, and distinctive. The longevity on my skin is, by the way, fantastic, like with most Guccis. 8 hours is no problem at all; you can still smell it the next day.
Who is Envy suitable for? Probably for no one and everyone, I can hardly pinpoint a specific type or occasion. Maybe best suited for over-50, somewhat rough-around-the-edges, self-important lawyers like Rolf Bossi. But basically, one must say: whoever wants to smell like this just wants to smell like this - it won’t really fit anywhere.
After I had also applied Envy to my skin, I had to endure the university day in my perfume cloud - because I felt a bit embarrassed, I settled down far away from any human company in the next seminar. I assumed that Envy was once again one of those perfumes that I like - while the rest of my age group finds it a terrible imposition. When a very nice fellow student (whom I otherwise had nothing to do with) sat down next to me, she moved closer instead of away from me - physically close. Whether she really liked the scent of Envy or just had her cozy day - no idea. In any case, she wasn’t driven away by Envy as I had expected.
After a second test, I treated myself to 50ml of the stuff. The bottle has been sitting here for almost a year now, but I still can’t decide whether I find the toxic green spray terrible or fantastic. Even though I rarely wear it, I haven’t been able to bring myself to sell it. If I ever want to smell like an extroverted retiree in ginger-vanilla soup, I know exactly where to reach."

Envy for Men,02/01/2020,Morpheus1,M,72,,6,Hyped Mainstream Designer at Moon Prices,"In my 2 years of activity on parfumo, I have learned quite a bit about fragrances and tested many.

At first, one thinks this scent is the holy grail. Everyone wants it, it is coveted and expensive.
That's what I thought at first too.

Ultimately, it’s not about having something in your collection for others,
but about finding your own style and showing individuality.
After all, you don’t have to chase every trend, not even in fragrances.

Here, an attempt was made to create a green spicy fragrance from the late 90s with modern elements for the new millennium.
These elements are flowers and leather.

If you have sniffed a bit into the real vintage classics of the 80s, then this Envy seems relatively normal.
It’s okay, but not the biggest fragrance hit.

For me, unfortunately, its composition doesn’t work:

The flowers, especially the rose, mixed with leather set off alarms in my nose.
Somehow, I don’t tolerate the green Envy well; it has a somewhat bitter sweet sourness that doesn’t harmonize very well with or precisely because of the green spice components.

It is slightly sweet, but above all strongly floral-leathery. That doesn’t fit well together in my nose. Vanilla is very, very subtle in the background. A very mature, strong, loud scent for men aged 40-50+ one might think. A slight old-fashionedness is undeniable.
“Grandpa” fragrances send their regards.

Wearing this scent at 20 to 30 years old would seem ridiculous and inappropriate to me, just to follow a trend.

In conclusion, it must be said that it is definitely not worth 400€ / 100ml.

Harsh words for the Envy disciples,
but that’s how I perceive it."
Envy for Men,04/16/2019,Sabanco,F,1,,10,400 € for a 100ml bottle - that says a lot,"After reading all the comments here, I wanted to join the disciples.
It’s a shame that Envy is no longer in production. Rumor has it that Tom Ford parted ways with the Gucci main brand and took his formula with him. This doesn’t quite align with his shares in the company, but given that he now has his own perfume brand, I suspect the formula was torn apart during the split by both parties, or aliens stole it.
No matter what speculations are circulating here - the fact is: this perfume deserves to be placed on a pedestal.
Here is my story:
Towards the end of its production, Envy was still available at Douglas. I, who had enjoyed wearing Dior Addict and Gucci Rush, went to Douglas once again to give myself hope for a new fragrance. At the end of my round, I made a detour and walked past the men’s fragrances, and there it caught my eye with its unusual color and bottle shape at that time, with that hefty cap. I thought: what on earth is that??? So I went over, drawn in like by magic, and tried it out. The saleswoman looked at me in surprise, but the moment the scent traveled through my nose into the farthest recesses, I forgot everything around me. I grabbed the packaged bottle and went to the checkout.
From that moment on, it became my perfume. My number 1, followed by Dior Addict, which I hardly wear anymore.
The truly amazing thing about this scent is that it adapts to the wearer. I gave it to some of my male friends to test. For them, it turned into a zesty woody tiger from the jungle - typically masculine. For me, however, this scent transforms into sandalwood, candy aisle, and lemon. And it lasts, it lasts longer and better than many high-priced neighbors and even longer than my recently acquired ""Noir"" by Tom Ford. Once a month, I spray 2-3 sprays on my coat, and that’s enough.
Normally, I like spicy, woody vanilla scents with a hint of mandarin, but not too much. This one is the big exception.
To return to the description ""Not of this world"":
Gym, summer, heat, sweat - reactivate this scent when applied to the décolletage, and it blends with everything your body emits - and it smells even better. (Think of the old advertisement for this scent)

It’s a pity that Envy is no longer produced. Unfortunately, there is nothing comparable.
Even its dupe from Larise smells too masculine and musky for me.

For those who have the money to invest 400 € in this perfume, congratulations on your purchase, use it sparingly, the unicorn."
Envy for Men,12/20/2014,Unruh,M,97,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,"Farewell, my friend...","No more shaking and no more wringing helps. This morning, I sprayed the last drops of “Envy for Men.” This fragrance was one of the last remnants from the beginning of my passion for perfume in my early twenties. And back then, among all the “boy scents,” it was the only truly adult one. It survived, deep in the closet, my years of fragrance abstinence and waited for its revival, which happened a little over a year ago. It has always been a scent for special moments for me...

“Envy for Men” starts off herb-spicy. Pepper and coriander are extremely present, but are quickly tamed by the mandarin, without being flattened. The citrus fruit caresses the two spices and complements them perfectly.
The subsequent phase is still quite spicy, but it becomes green-woody with slight floral influences. Rose, jasmine, and clove join in, but not just the blossoms, no, the whole plant, with stem and stalk, with leaves, flowers, and roots. Masculine green-herb and slightly floral, but not in excess. With the slowly fading coriander and pepper, a fantastic combination is achieved here! One of my favorite fragrance components, fine sandalwood, perfectly rounds off this phase.
The fragrance is already perfect at this point. The base is the crowning conclusion. The combination of leather and patchouli is generally my personal favorite, here supported by a subtle, natural vanilla pod. Vanilla is also the last note that gently leaves my skin after an astonishingly long time.

Together with Givenchy's “Gentleman” and Guerlain's “Héritage,” “Envy for Men” is so far the only male fragrance candidate to receive 100% from me. For reasons I mentioned in my comment on “Gentleman,” I do not do that.

As the last fragrance molecules decompose this evening, an era comes to an end for me. “Envy for Men” is a milestone; it is Gucci's best fragrance for me.
Although I have found my exit fragrance and own some other olfactory delights, I will miss it. It's a shame that it has been discontinued.
Fragrances like this are needed in the (men's) world now more than ever!

Farewell. It was nice with you; I will keep you in my best memories."
Envy for Men,08/30/2011,Peanut,F,218,,13,You shouldn't try to change men!,"What have I nagged and tried to change about my beloved! I called him a fragrance philistine, Prince Valium, olfactory deep sleep. I slipped him samples, gave him perfumes and fragrance vouchers for his birthday, Christmas, and Easter.

And what did HE do? He placed the new fragrances decoratively on the shelf and used the vouchers to buy perfume for me. He did everything to avoid giving up his ""Sculpture"" by Nikos, which he has been using for what feels like decades and which suits him brilliantly, but -- at some point, as a woman, you want to bury your nose in something else.

Apparently, I complained one time too many, because at some point he came around the corner, beaming from ear to ear and proud as a peacock, with a turquoise shopping bag. From his victorious smile, I could tell that this time there would be no fragrance for me. I was right! What emerged was ""Gucci Envy For Men.""

Aha.

Well, how should I put it? It's certainly something completely different from ""Sculpture."" And it's beautifully green, which my nose quite likes. But the mix of spicy-green and floral-sweet doesn't entirely appeal to me. The hint of coriander causes me intense nausea. And all in all, the entire composition makes me think of mosquito spray.

HE thinks he has hit the olfactory jackpot, I have stomach cramps.

If darling now sticks to ""Gucci Envy"" for the next few years, just as he did with ""Sculpture"" by Nikos, then I have a serious problem. The only solution: blackmail! ""If you wear Gucci Envy, I'll drown myself in Chloé"" (darling's quote about Chloé: laundromat).

Oh yes. Problems upon problems. But -- I guess I deserve it. You shouldn't try to change men."
Envy for Men,09/30/2016,NLX,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,The Cruising Altitude,"...had already been reached for some time and there should be just over 3 hours of flight time left to Frankfurt am Main. It was one of those wonderful days in midsummer. Cavok! No turbulence, monotonous straight flying, boredom! But then the moment of relief. I flipped through the in-flight magazine of the former Hamburg International to the next page and saw this image! GUCCI ENVY. Several stacked bottles pointing in different directions with oversized caps in jet black and green contents. I was thrilled by the presentation of the advertisement and admired the designer-specific competence of Gucci's marketing department. Rarely have I seen a perfume advertisement that was so appealingly designed.
I was never a fan of green fragrances. Not even back in my early 20s. Nevertheless, Gucci's marketing back then, which was impeccable, somehow convinced me. Upon arriving in Frankfurt, I decided to quickly search for this scent in duty-free despite being completely exhausted. I held the bottle in my hand, which was covered in fingerprints and, in reality, was not quite as beautiful as I had expected. Never mind, I took the first spray on the cardboard strip! I was like petrified, and contrary to all expectations, the colorants of the fragrance immediately contradicted my expectations! Not a green scent! Luckily. I dared to test it on my forearm and left the perfume department to head home.

The fragrance initially impressed with a very fruity top note of syrupy sweet citrus fruits infused with cinnamon and coriander. It was one of the first fragrances with a real progression and complexity that I encountered. It delivered an outstanding sillage for hours, and throughout its superior longevity for an EDT, new scent peaks of ambered leather, spices, and a hint of powderiness unfolded. It was difficult to distinctly separate the top, heart, and base notes over time. Even after hours and upon my arrival home, I could still perceive the sweetness of the almost candied citrus fruits on vanillin. I usually don't like vanilla. However, in this fragrance, it was wonderfully harmonious even on my rather demanding skin.

The fragrance ranks among the best releases ever on the market beyond the ""real"" niche.
If I had to smell this today blindfolded and guess the perfumer, I would immediately guess Gualtieri!
I might claim that it would give the impression that he was even inspired by this fragrance back then. If I meet him, I will certainly want to discuss this fragrance with him. This scent offers so much material for conversation and was surely a tremendous challenge for Daniela Andrier. I have really tried almost all of her fragrances and must say that this one is certainly among her best. If not the best.

For all those who did not get to experience it. You definitely missed something. And I say this reluctantly. Even in this case, I have not found a worthy successor or a dupe to this day.

In my subjective feeling, it can be described as a cross between Blamage, Chinawhite, and Prada Amber pour Homme.
That may exceed the imagination of most; to make the description even simpler, imagine Blamage with reduced intensity, with mandarin instead of peach and a vanilla addition.

In the end, the question remains why such a cultural asset is lost. It is a mystery to me. I cannot explain the demise of this magnificent fragrance."
Envy for Men,11/07/2018,Farneon,M,112,,9,You smell so good ... being jealous is allowed!,"So, now I'm daring to say something! :-) I am giving (I believe for the first time) 10 points for a fragrance! What a shame that this is hardly available for purchase anymore. I was lucky with a pretty good eBay deal ... the rest is a love story, even though it only started a few days ago!

""Envy"" really has the potential to become my signature scent. I took it to the cinema over the weekend and immediately received a compliment (""What are you wearing that smells so nice?"") and during the film, I was bathing in my own sillage. I didn't care at all that I might have applied it a bit too generously. I just thought to myself (the movie was quite dull): ""Man, you smell good!""

What usually puts me off a fragrance is leather. However, I don't consciously perceive that here, so everything is (more than) fine. The rest is a combination that I consider unique and I have never smelled anything like it before: masculine, seductive, spicy, woody, paired with a gentle sharpness and a balsamic base. I don't want to go into too much detail: I can hardly imagine a more beautiful scent for the moment!

The result: I am really happy! :-) I still have a sample box with 15 fragrances that just arrived today, and I don't even want to try any further. For the moment, of course, but that has already lasted four days. From now on, every new fragrance will have an extremely hard time competing with ""Envy."" Let's see what the previously unknown Daniela Andrier has conjured up ..."
Envy for Men,10/17/2015,Pegasus2,M,13,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,My Déjà-vu of Green Spiciness par excellence,"I am sitting in front of a Gucci Envy Men perfume miniature that I originally ordered to
join the conversation after the many comments on eBay.
And what can I say, even though I have never owned this scent before, I am experiencing a rather positive déjà-vu.
It feels so familiar to me... as if I had used it for years...!??
Yet I have never had it...
What could possibly be so similar? D & G The One Gentleman - no, not really! - maybe in terms of spices, but that one is aquatic and does not smell green. Moreover, Envy is far superior to Gentleman (although I don't necessarily find that one bad). Davidoff Classic? No! Too harsh... Davidoff Relax... I don't know... too long ago... So the déjà-vu remains... ...whatever, this perfume saw the light of the perfume world during a time when a perfume was more of a pure utility for me and did not represent a direct area of interest... whatever...!

This scent is one of the best I have smelled in a long time.
It starts very fresh, green, spicy.
The pepper is absolutely present but not sharply pungent, rather in a unique softness and yet powerful
(if it were a wine, one would probably speak of silky tannins). This character carries through the entire fragrance from the top note to the base note.
A mandarin underlines the overall work, which also comes across as rather green instead of classically mandarin. But it exudes a wonderfully pleasant freshness.

In the heart note, various floral scents come through that I cannot exactly categorize, as well as woods that are powdery / velvety.

In the base note, there are then 3 true classics for an attractive men's perfume:
Leather, patchouli, vanilla.

What hasn’t been said about this scent already... now I can somewhat understand it... Tom Ford: It practically screams sex! Oh wow! What a slogan!
Whether I would want to equate Gucci Envy Men with an aphrodisiac, I don't know, but I would say it is definitely an erotic scent!

I also don't think it requires much courage to wear this scent - because I find it, at best, incredibly pleasing - without being proper.
It is designed so well and harmoniously that one almost has to like it, unless one has a problem with some ingredient or simply does not like the green or spicy fragrance direction.

But one can truly say that nothing was done wrong with this scent in its genre!
It is spicy-sweet without ever being greasy, sticky, or even hinting at any lack of masculinity, cheapness, or a candy store vibe.

It is green/fresh/woody without ever spreading even the slightest bitterness or herbaceousness.

It is sexy without ever being socially unacceptable or vulgar.

And then this smooth, powerful softness! Actually, things that should exclude each other.

One of the few fragrances in this world for which there can only be 100%.
Fragrances where everything was done right!
Here:

Envy for Men,11/19/2012,Smello,M,61,,11,"Bye bye, my love","The first fragrance that made me angry because the bottle was empty.

For more than 12 years, I have mourned this scent; there has honestly never been a fragrance that embodied me more than Gucci Envi.

A resonance so positive, so attractive like it, it’s rare for a woman to give me such a compliment, solely because of the fragrance.

It is masculine enough that you don’t have to be over 40 to wear it. It is elegant without having to wear a suit. It is as sporty as each one of us, without being a tennis sock wearer, and so fresh that you can easily forgo cool fresh deodorant sprays.

The woody notes accompanied me with every step; Jasmine said hello, Patchouli joined in, and the sweet vanilla nodded along. That’s how I liked to smell.

The fragrance: my first true love in perfume.

The longevity: I remember a long-lasting scent.

The sillage: Wonderful.

The bottle: Masculine, classic."
Envy for Men,11/21/2019,Osbornecox,M,1,,3,ENVY seems to be very sought after...,"I bought a bottle around 2003. I thought the scent was great, but I used it very rarely. About ten years later, I casually threw away the cube along with a few other old fragrances. It was sitting untouched in the cupboard and taking up storage space. What do you want with a perfume that you don't use? Sell it? I didn't want to bother for 5,- €.
I really didn't know anything...!
That's how it is. Personal appreciation related to a subject increases, passion is ignited, you become interested and learn more, and suddenly a product is mystified. Now everything is beautifully collected."
Envy for Men,10/13/2024,Jannemann33,M,32,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,90s Part III,"Coriander? YES! And how. Soapiness after spraying. That's special, but really good. It's quickly clear after spraying that Envy is something very special and independent!

The scent is somehow soapy. As mentioned at the beginning. And due to components like rose, jasmine, patchouli, among others, the scent is also quite classic. At the time when the fragrance was released, many perfumes were aquatic, fresh, ""blue,"" sweet - this one is not at all and is certainly not a ""child of its time."" At the same time, it also reminds me a bit of the fragrances that followed later. Those that had a spice or a woodiness. I find it a bit like a form of crossover, if I may be symbolic here.

The scent has a bit of 80s soapiness, with patchouli and classic rose or carnation. But it is also soft, like, for example, an Egoiste, which is definitely 90s and also uses sandalwood, which we have here as well.
But there is also leather, vanilla, and jasmine, which already leans a bit into trends that, in my view, were a bit ahead of the fragrance. This leads into the 2000s.

If we look a few years ahead at Gucci, we will see that with Gucci Pour Homme (2003) they were also very far ahead of their time.

The scent is - what I really like - unique. You know it once you've smelled it. That, for me, is what defines a brilliant fragrance that represents a kind of signature. Even in its development, it is special; it is spicy, I don't really perceive it as leathery. It's soapiness, spice, it's a bit herby. That's great. The fragrance has a special note that I recognize immediately, but I can't explicitly trace it back to a specific ingredient. Above all, it is ""green."" Today, green is back in trend, but you, Envy, are unfortunately no longer available.

Lost in the jumble of the overwhelming supply of weekly new releases in countless variations, soulless and characterless. More is more, and the market for exclusive niches is no longer exclusive, but every niche manufacturer subtly wishes that every second person walks around with their scent. Back then, there were designers who brought something to the market. It was almost an event in the perfumery of a small town.

Nostalgic? Yes. But, who cares!

Why they would also discontinue it, I have no idea. But I know that it could still easily stand its ground today and would even fit into the current trend. What a shame. So I am left with the memory and a few drops."
Envy for Men,08/11/2013,Sisyphos,M,143,HELPFUL REVIEW,12,Fragrance Hieroglyphs and the Glorious Three,"Next to Background by Jil Sander, Envy For Men by Gucci is the fragrance that perhaps influenced me the most before I began to delve a little deeper into the subject of perfume. And like Background, Envy For Men has also disappeared from the market. EFM is a wonderful Eau de Toilette that is not easy to describe. I wore this fragrance at a time when I might have used three perfumes regularly. I didn't miss anything back then. The access to a perfume at that time - and I don't mean this judgmentally - was direct, unfiltered, simply naive.

In such cases, there is always the danger of romanticizing a fragrance retrospectively. Therefore, I tried to approach this scent critically once again and took my time in assessing it. Green is Envy for Men not only in color. The fragrance is spicy, with a slight sharpness that could stem from coriander present at the beginning. What I also recognize is a sour freshness. I really like that, as it makes EFM not sluggish but rather agile. Woody notes quickly come into play, making this perfume more masculine. A bit of everything? What kind of fragrance is this?

In the dry down, there is a beautiful and subtle sweetness, in my opinion. For my taste, the vanilla is not too present. I have a kind of long drink association. EFM is not boozy, but it does remind me of an alcoholic beverage. At the same time, Envy exudes something cool. I cannot identify the mandarin, but a pleasant fruity nuance plays in the background. It is not a true oriental. Nor is it a pure wood scent. So what is Gucci Envy For Men then?

For me, it is wearable in all four seasons and various occasions, although one must admit that the fragrance is not subtle. However, I do not find it vulgar or loud. For me, it is the perfect holiday scent, whether skiing or at the beach. I do not understand the leathery component in this fragrance; it does not reveal itself to me. I would not have thought that leather could be included here. By the way, this strongly reminds me of Relax by Davidoff. Indeed, what a fabulous thing the return of the glorious three would be! Background by Jil Sander, Relax by Davidoff, and Envy For Men by Gucci. I would probably acquire all three fragrances immediately, although I still consider Background to be the undisputed number one.

In my eyes, EFM is an independent and multifaceted fragrance; there is simply a lot to sniff out. I try to decipher fragrance hieroglyphs. However, when it comes to longevity and sillage, I am quite sure: both are in the upper good range. A mysterious scent, not truly eerie (in the sense of frightening), but somehow puzzling.

(Thank you very much for the sample, Yatagan.)"
Envy for Men,04/08/2013,Chnokfir,M,214,,6,What a Bad Purchase,"If a fragrance has taught me not to believe in love at first sniff, it was Envy for Men.

The new scent came fresh out of the box onto the shelves, the perfumery owner hadn't even priced the goods yet and was looking for a list, when I already had the tester in hand. A great bottle, nicely angular, a massive black cap that covers two-thirds of the glass, a light green color that promised a lot.

The first spray on the card immediately dispersed into the air, the first whiff promised true joy. Further sniffing at the card over the next few minutes only got better. I sniffed other new arrivals, but they all went straight into the trash can that day. After a few minutes, I was sure I wanted to test this scent on my skin as well. A few sprays on my wrists and ""Aaaaaaaaahhhh!"" Delight! A lovely fragrance! So off I went back onto the street, did a little shopping, had a small lunch at my favorite bistro, and then straight back to the perfumery. The scent kept getting better. By then, Mrs. Schnurer also knew the price, quickly the discounts for the first sale of this new fragrance were negotiated, and the largest size EdT came home with me in a bag. I smelled good, my girlfriend could smell me well, I was happy!

The next morning, I applied this wonderful new scent again, and just after a good quarter of an hour, the hammer fell! First came the tart citrus freshness of the mandarin, then soon followed spicy pepper notes paired with floral accords like jasmine and rose, and then ... parsley! And with a vehemence I had never smelled before. The scent of this lovely garden herb covered everything, lasting the entire day. I could smell nothing else. My surroundings were consulted, but no, they smelled all sorts of things, just not parsley! In the following days, I repeatedly applied the fragrance in different concentrations and always got the same result: parsley!

Two weeks later, I went back to the perfumery. Suddenly, their tester smelled like parsley to me too. On site, they said they couldn't understand this association, but that perhaps I had ""wired"" either the garden carnation or the vetiver incorrectly. However, I have never had this connection in my nose with any vetiver scent before or since. And you don't find garden carnation too often in fragrances either.

I was disappointed, and in the following weeks, I tested the scent in all sorts of situations and seasons, but the parsley wouldn't budge. I really like parsley as a spice in food, but on the skin, it just doesn't work.

Since then, I only buy fragrances after I have thoroughly tested them with a small tester over a few days. This was my very first overwhelming fragrance mispurchase, and it still lingers intensely in my nose!"
Envy for Men,11/23/2012,ManIntense,M,1,,11,"My Big Brother, Gucci Envy Men ""the fragrant bond""","Gucci Envy Men will always remind me of my big brother.
I was just 14 years old at the time, and I smelled this fragrance in our house.
But what was it?
Something sweet?
Something fresh?
Something classic?
Or was it spicy?
I didn't know, but one thing I knew:
I had never smelled anything like it before, and my nose liked it.
Following my nose, down the hallway through the open door,
I ended up two doors down in my brother's room.

He was standing there,
in front of his mirror,
his last glance,
his last spray,
like every weekend ""picobello"" to go out, but this time with this new masculine scent.

He was now complete.
He was my role model.
My feelings at that moment were:
I wanted to grow up quickly,
to have his clothes,
to keep his style,
and last but not least, to wear this fragrance.
I wanted to become a man, no
a gentleman.

From that day on, this fragrance became ""the fragrant bond"" between me and my brother.
It never left my nose,
not my mind
and to this day, not my heart.

Unfortunately, this perfume is no longer produced.
Nevertheless, I found a 100 ml bottle of EDT online
and gifted it to him for his birthday this year after 11 years.
He was very happy about it, but he doesn't know what joy he has given me.

Envy for Men,02/11/2012,DrPablo,M,55,,6,Patchouli with Vanilla Always Works,"Envy is one of the few perfumes that I can tolerate on myself. It is just sweet enough that the woody note becomes pleasant and creates a very subtle masculine aura without a cologne scent.
It clings almost a bit too long for my taste - one spray is enough to last until the next wash (thanks to Tonalid). I always apply perfume to my clothes and never on my skin, due to allergies. This does not hinder its development. When applied a second time, the dry down accumulates, which does not contribute to an improvement.....
Unfortunately, it is no longer available."

Something like that. A good, interesting opening, where sometimes a hint of mint and a bit of medicinal balm comes through. I can't quite place it. A beautiful, chaotic jumble.

Envy for Men,09/23/2015,Konstantinos,M,3,,3,The Beautiful Green Dream,"This is my first comment here on this forum, after having read along for months. I felt compelled to share my opinion as well. Is it necessary? Probably not, but I’ll do it anyway. Please forgive me :)
Why this fragrance in particular? Because it is, to this day, a MILESTONE in the history of perfume for me!
When it was released in 1998, I tried it right away and it was love at first sight. Since then, this fragrance treasure has accompanied me everywhere. I wore it at work, in the disco, on a first rendezvous. Although I was too young for this scent back then, I loved it fiercely and still do. No one my age liked it at the time. But I have never received as many compliments for a fragrance as I have for this one. It’s also a sign that a perfume really suits you. The opening of coriander, mandarin, pepper, and rosewood is very noticeable, and then there’s the leather, vanilla, and patchouli. For me, a hint of marzipan develops at the very end-divine! Very harmonious and also very charismatic! Now you have left us! I only have about 80ml of this green gold left. I hope it lasts a long time.... I pray to the gods that there will be a reissue someday..."
Envy for Men,01/12/2011,Ryker,M,23,,4,"Good, but it lacks the final kick","So, after I managed to snag a bottle of Envy for Men at a great price here in the forum (thanks to Schnuffos), I guess it's time for a comment.

Envy was a blind buy, as I couldn't get a sample from my trusted fragrance dealer. However, due to the fragrance notes and comments, I really wanted to test this scent.

The top note is truly successful. As a fan of Fahrenheit Absolute, I love spicy perfumes, wonderfully peppery and spicy! The top note could definitely last a bit longer, as it is the highlight of the fragrance for me.

Longevity is indeed a strong suit of EfM (I can only agree with my predecessor MaxFavier: You can still smell it the next day!), but it is quite limited to sweetened patchouli.

I would also agree on the character of EfM. This is more of a scent from the category: Here I am! What’s the world worth!
Subtle is probably the wrong word (sorry Hoto74666), as an office scent it is rather unsuitable.

Long story short: Great scent, but to get 100% from me, the spicy component would need to last significantly longer. For me, Fahrenheit Absolute is still the benchmark for spicy fragrances, and EfM doesn't quite reach that."
Envy for Men,08/09/2010,Deep666,M,39,,1,Classic,"In comparison, it's quite an average scent. I'm curious to see how long it will still be produced."

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine,10/07/2023,Einfinken,F,74,,3,Pretty,"Jasmine and white floral dominant fragrances are often hard for me. They can be fine as supporting notes but when they are front and center many of them to turn very dirty smelling on my skin or just become too screechy and headache inducing for me. However Gorgeous Jasmine does none of those things and the only real way to describe this scent is pretty. It probably won't blow anyone's mind for uniqueness but it is still a lovely, feminine floral fragrance.

I am a big believer that softer and easy reach scents very much have a place in a perfume collection and not everything needs to be some great masterpiece. I can respect a fragrance that sets out to be good at what it says on the tin. Gorgeous Jasmine is precisely that. The jasmine here is not a dirty white floral, rather it is fresh and green. The rose very much takes a back seat and lets the jasmine sparkle. I said this also in my review of Gorgeous Magnolia but I really like the way Gucci does patchouli in this line. Patchouli is such a hit or miss note but here it is, not a dirty patchouli but simply a very light earthiness. When combined with the creaminess of the sandalwood, magnolia and benozoin and the greeness of the jasmine, the entire effect is realistic jasmine and fresh, clean feeling.

Very pretty, easy reach daily scent that feels appropriate for any situation and probably could be worn year round if you're fine with skin scents. My husband seems to like this one too because he is not someone who comments regularly on my perfume, but every time I wear this he tells me I smell nice.

Absolutely love the packaging and atomizer of this line. The scent is like a 7.5-8 but these bottles and atomizers are 10/10 for me. I own a 50 ml bottle and could see myself repurchasing.

Eta: this has become one of the most worn perfumes in my collection. So easy to wear, appropriate any time and anywhere. This is now one of my favorite clean white florals."
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine,09/08/2023,Julipet,F,45,,3,Delicate flower on a green branch,"That’s exactly what is says – Gorgeous Jasmine. I received a tester as a gift with my other purchase, and I must say I didn’t expect much because I am not very into realistic jasmine or hard-core white florals, but this is so beautiful! At first blast, it’s fresh and floral – just what you’d expect. Then, an hour or so later, jasmine blooms into more intense, soapier self that I would whole-heartedly recommend to all white-flower fans. Then rose joins it producing warmer, sunnier impression, and jasmine begins to remind me mock-orange flowers, which I adore, with slight accents of solar notes and green leaves. Then I begin noticing magnolia coupled with benzoin, reminding me a bit of Zara Violet blossom or even Mugler’s Alien. Then sandalwood adds substance and creaminess, making it warmer.

Also, ever-so-delicate patchouli keeping it mysterious with a cool waft here and there! The tester leaflet didn’t list patchouli note and I thought I was imagining it half of the day, until I looked GFGJ up here and was reassured that I’m not hallucinating.

This is the best jasmine that I ever tried – not too intense, but not obscured by other ingredients, rather, tenderly supported by them, like a flower floating in sweet nectar. Other jasmine scents often peddle jasmine so much that you would be better off just using essential oil instead. Yet Gucci Flora creates an impression of a fresh delicate flower on a green branch, and it’s lovely. It makes you feel lovely too. Very inspiring perfume.

If I had to ascribe a personality to it, I would say it’s a young girl walking in the morning to her first office job, full of hopes and ambition, willing to impress, but also daydreaming about love. She wears white blouse, minimalistic sparkles of jewelry, and wind is playing with her shiny loose hair.

I perceive it as a perfect day or even morning scent, lovely for spring, cooler summer days, and early autumn. It has the freshness and the warmth enough to cover most of the year except the dramatic extremes. I am so amazed by it that I must post it right away, so no comment on longevity yet, but I plan to update."
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine,04/06/2025,Ursaw,F,166,,2,Jasmine in name only,"Bad news is that upper notes smell like citrus flavored dishwash. Good news is that they disappear pretty much immediately. But where's the jasmine? I tested it on both myself and my partner, and on neither of our bodies was there any jasmine. Just rose and magnolia on a super sweet balsamic backdrop.

I don't know, perhaps it's my own fault for expecting a fresh jasmine scent from a perfume called ""Gorgeous Jasmine""? Or for expecting anything at all for that matter. Whatever flowers were there – withered away into incomprehensible sweet mush after the first hour. By the end of the second hour it was completely gone from my skin.

An utter waste of money, but hey, at least it didn't waste much of my time."
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine,02/05/2023,Telekinec,F,498,,2,Beautiful and stunning perfume!,"I am pleasantly surprised. I wasn't expecting much since I'm not that much of a floral fragrance type of girl, but I WILL be moving on to a 10ml travel size once I'm through with the sampler vial.

So, everything starts off with a fresh zing of juicy and tangy citrus. After a few minutes, the jasmine unfurls its creamy, white floral scent and it is a beauty, let me tell you! I could now sense the black pepper giving the juice a very uplifting vibe. It's giving me vintage, but at the same time, modern esthetic. Beautiful and well blended together, I instantly fell in love. It's soft, feminine, lovely and just so nice! The roses blended themselves very well to tone down the indolic aspect of the jasmine. After a while there is this woody but creamy aspect that's coming through thanks to the sandalwood, but the jasmine does remain the star all throughout. I usually don't like patchouli, but this time I barely smelled it since the jasmine was in the spotlight. All in all it's a beautiful fragrance if you're searching for a perfume where jasmine is the main character. It's pretty, smells great and is a great crowd-pleaser!"
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine,10/05/2023,ScentStudio,F,156,,2,"Once again, a designer flop","Despite not liking the fragrances from Gucci I have tried as of yet, I have always been circling around Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia. Something about it spoke to me, but I only tried it quickly and with a small spray on the wrist. It was nice, but I wasn't enamored. Then, suddenly, Gorgeous Jasmine was launched and something about the two bottles called my name, so I tried it on a paper strip and I just had to try it properly!
Initially quite sweet and of course, floral. Somewhat soapy, which I didn't expect when trying it on a paper strip.
I would have loved the juicy fruitiness of mandarin, which is listed in the composition, but it is nowhere to be found.

After dry down, Gorgeous Jasmine becomes quite powdery.
And alas, it is boring. Absolutely boring, like any other Gucci fragrance I have tried...
It's been a while since I've reviewed a fragrance based on the scent on a paper strip, hasn't it?
So, because of the difference, I've sprayed generously on a paper strip and let me tell you, the mandarin is detectable even from afar!
I sprayed the test strip and layed it to evaporate the alcohol, just in arms reach, I could smell the fruity mandarin. After dry down, it is much milder and up close, Gorgeous Jasmine is a fruity and juicy floral! This is what made me so intrigued in the first place, the charming fruitiness with the mild floral in the back. On skin, however, Gorgeous Jasmine is nothing gorgeous, just a floral simpleton.
So simple and generic that I'm struggling to describe it, whereas on paper many words come to mind; fruity, fresh, feminine, delicate, perfect for summer, and even spring, a little peachy, reminding me of The Scent by Boss, I could go on.

Once again, I must admit that designer fragrances aren't for me."

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine,09/04/2025,EmberFields,F,38,,1,"Sharp, sweet and synthetic jasmine","Gucci's Flora Gorgeous Jasmine is a fun and fresh fruity-floral that doesn't take itself too seriously. On the flipside, it can come across as too sharp, sweet and synthetic. It's not necessarily a bad perfume, but you can tell Alberto Morillas was composing to a strict budget here.

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine opens to a salvo of bright clean bergamot with a hint of orange blossom. The jasmine is present from the start, and is equal parts sweet and green. It's a clean jasmine, without a hint of indoles, and is ever so slightly soapy thanks to the orange blossom, and a nice (if noticeably synthetic) watery rose note. The overall effect is similar to a fruity-floral shampoo.

In the dry down, there are wafts of amber and scratchy patchouli, but the fragrance stays fairly light and clean, thanks to the persistent bergamot and jasmine. I suspect the bergamot's persistence is due to the citrus-floral aromachemical dihydromyrcenol - an ingredient commonly used in men's fragrances and cleaning products, which can smell harsh and chemical in certain contexts. This is, unfortunately, one of those contexts. It doesn't outright ruin the fragrance, but it does detract from an otherwise well-balanced composition.

While Flora Gorgeous Jasmine is overall a playful, uplifting fragrance, it can't match the elegant ease of Gucci's Bloom EAU DE PARFUM. It may share Bloom's touch of greenness, but it also lacks Bloom's creaminess and smoothness. It's just too sharp, too unrefined, and ultimately pretty ineffectual."

It is of the little perfumes of Jasmine that do not smell to lady, but more fresh and young.

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine,09/26/2025,LadyLane83,F,81,,0,Gardenia Jasmine,"All I smell is bath and body works gardenia from the 90s. Did not expect that at all. I mean it’s fresh and clean, very white floral, but yeah…I can see why ET Gardenia is often mentioned as a dupe. Very linear, it just stays gardenia all the way through for me. …This really makes me curious about Gucci’s actual Flora Gardenia fragrance.

Sillage is medium the first hour and then it shrinks down pretty close to skin, longevity is maybe three hours.

I am pretty bummed out about this one…It’s a cold and wet November day so maybe that has something to do with it. Putting my bottle away until I can try again in the spring.

Edit to add: Spring came around and as the weather warmed up this fragrance really started to bloom. The jasmine started to shine and the performance is much better in a mild, warm atmosphere"
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine,09/05/2022,Mdln0320,F,28,,29,My Personal Feel-Good Fragrance,"I am still quite new to the world of perfume; my entry into this new ""obsession"" began a few weeks ago. For the first time in ages, I was in the perfume department to test a few classics among women's perfumes and to get an overview. But even before I could test the first perfume on my list, this bottle caught my eye. Among all the extravagant and elegantly designed glass bottles, it stood out - a turquoise bottle, my favorite color, with a floral vintage print on the label, subtle yet elegant, exactly in the style I love so much. Of course, I HAD to test it first. And I was shockingly in love. The slightly fruity mandarin blossom note in the opening, the sweet and gentle jasmine scent, even the soapy note in the drydown that reminds me of laundry detergent, but in a good way... I can certainly understand that it won't be everyone's favorite. But for me, it is simply a feel-good fragrance through and through.

I tested several other perfumes, some of which I liked very much, but this fragrance was still my favorite. After 2-3 more sniffing tours through various perfumeries, I finally got it for myself. And everyone around me loves the scent on me, also because it fits me perfectly. It's as if it was developed for me, including the bottle design.

I intentionally waited to write the review until now because I wanted to make sure that my initial enthusiasm wouldn't fade once I got to know more fragrances. In the meantime - that is, at this moment while I am writing this text - I have sniffed a lot of fragrances and expanded my collection with some other favorites. And yet, Flora Gorgeous Jasmine remains my absolute favorite. Gentle, elegant, fresh jasmine with a slight sweetness cuddles up to my skin and caresses me without being intrusive. For the people around me, the scent seems to be something very special; I have been asked several times which perfume I am wearing because it smells so ""fine and elegant."" On my skin, it lasts a good 6 hours before it becomes intimate; for the first 3-4 hours, I still enjoy the scent myself, but after that, I no longer perceive it, although my surroundings do for a bit longer.

My associations with the fragrance:
At the beginning: A walk in spring, just before the start of summer. A light, refreshing breeze blows over the skin, gentle sun rays provide warmth, and the long-missed, sweet-smelling flowers adorn nature.

Drydown: A hug from mom (I could swear she always used a laundry detergent that smells similar), before you fall into the freshly made, cool, soft bed after a long day, freshly showered.

For me, this is still the fragrance that suits me best, that brings me joy every time I smell it - and it appeared just in time at the beginning of my journey into the world of perfumes."
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine,08/01/2022,Poesiefanny,F,31,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,20,Supercalifragilistic? Expli-Alligatorish!,"My new favorite. Contemporary AND classic. If you don't have a grand Southern wardrobe at hand or would attract too much attention with a crinoline, but still want to feel superelegant - then you can wear whatever you like and still irritate your surroundings olfactorily with a grand entrance. I have a great fondness for a polished lady atmosphere with a discreet costume in pastel tones, silk blouse, fluttering scarf, wagon wheel hat, and matching gloves - all silky soft and flowing. Snug and slightly floral, sweet but not too sweet, and a little blurred - a daguerreotype with faded colors and hair blown by the wind. There must be some counterpoint. This jasmine-supported favorite perfume has such a grandeur, as the citrusy freshness of the mandarin blossom prevents the elegant jasmine from drifting off into the musty bayou. And it also serves as an opening for the ladylike magnolia - I don't mean that in a derogatory way, quite the opposite. It becomes creamy and skinny butter-soft over time, as the hesperidic note recedes. Then the sillage also diminishes. Longevity is good. The high-quality bottle is a decoration for any vanity or bathroom shelf. - It can be enjoyed entirely for oneself, but also brings joy to others. More suitable for ladies over 30 - for those who prefer a slightly fruitier and cheekier scent and enjoy similarly playful ingredients, I recommend the equally new delightful flanker from My Way Floral. I like that one too and it feels like Flora's younger cousin ;-)"
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine,01/02/2023,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,21,Not Just for Poodle Lovers,"I admit that I immediately reflected on the commercial with the white poodle in the flower meadow - because poodles and flowers are my thing.
I had to test this promising fragrance.
Especially since the beautiful poodle was cast as the protagonist of this scent.
Even my poodle-loving husband enjoys the spot - and he has no objections to driving to the perfume store with me.
And the trip was worth it.
The jasmine is radiant white and lush - and is delicately accompanied by magnolia.
Roses mix in with a velvety touch, making the fragrance soft and cuddly.
The patchouli frames the pleasant scent composition - and adds a touch of elegance.
A casually elegant fragrance that leans towards the romantic side.
I find it irresistible - and we reach for the bottle in harmony."
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine,09/22/2022,Serenissima,F,1222,,19,white-flowered tsunami,"How I love the early summer time when jasmine spreads its rich, sometimes intoxicating aromas in generous waves of fragrance.
These golden faces with their radiant white petal crowns on the dark green foliage, which, due to its dullness, forms the most beautiful backdrop for their radiance, the decorative feathery “umbels” of summer jasmine, the delicate star jasmine, and all its many varieties that have one thing in common: their unmistakable scent!
Sometimes fresh and just gently unfolding, a moment of virginity, yearning towards the sunset as the right time for white flowers begins; or the already practiced, sensual blooming beauties in their full ripeness, not to forget the slightly overripe and therefore somewhat carrion-like fragrant ""little stinkers,"" which so wonderfully serve as softly glowing light reflections to help the heavy oud compositions achieve their warm, erotic-floral radiance.
It’s no wonder that jasmine must not be missing in almost any of the classic floral fragrance creations and often spreads great fragrance joy as a soloist.

And who would be surprised that I quickly positioned my little, so curious nose for “Flora Gorgeous Jasmine” by Gucci after my Belgian fragrance friend Jessica was so enthusiastic and urged me to try this fragrance composition: ""You must try it, Dear: It's really gorgeous!""
I could have held back due to previous Gucci fragrance experiences:
Oh, if only I had!
But I sprayed myself, albeit not too generously, only to be immediately taken captive by a true wave of jasmine fragrance with a slightly unpleasant metallic-iridescent streak.
Almost unleashed, as I already wrote in the statement, jasmine squadrons invade me and my senses, which are so trustingly wide open and receptive.
But where is the sensual allure, its ripe eroticism, the fine, sometimes softly purring feline animality of my beloved jasmine?
A tsunami-like wave of white flowers overwhelms me dominantly, leaving me no time to enjoy the different aromas of the beloved floral splendor.
So dominant that the fresh and simultaneously delicate citrus fragrance entrée with the tingling note of black pepper only briefly appears like a quick flicker, acting almost as a door opener for “His Highness Jasmine” and must immediately step aside.
Magnolia in spring's gentle delicacy gets startled and unfortunately flees too quickly, only the fragrant splendor of the Damask roses, which have been too proud for generations to yield the field to this abundance of foreign aromas, stands almost defiantly against it.
Even here, this jasmine does not allow for any dissent; its importance must come first!
I miss the usually harmonious interplay of the fragrance notes: What a pity!
The beautiful base of aromatic and resinous-smoky fragrance notes, which can be traced back to sandalwood and benzoin, and which should provide a familiar and skillful final highlight with rich golden-brown and earthy patchouli accords, almost gets lost on me.
Up to this point, this unusual jasmine weight, with its actually very sympathetic entourage in tow, has already overwhelmed me (and thus made me scent-deaf to everything else?).

I am exhausted and slowly feel bothered.
So the not too pronounced longevity is quite welcome; my skin doesn’t seem to agree either.
My beloved jasmine magic has probably been bound here in richly flowered branches to a witch's broom, with which my devotion to it - at least here in this creation - is to be driven away.
It worked: I capitulate to the fragrance fullness of Gucci's ""Flora Gorgeous Jasmine""
And so I am glad when the overly loud proclamation: “Jasmine to power!” slowly fades away, along with the consequences of a fragrance explosion, which I did not expect at all.
Only now, as I resign, do pleasantly creamy, soapy fragrance nuances emerge from my skin, reminiscent of “Jasmine at its best!”, which finally reconcile me a bit, so that we do not part in complete discord.

I admit, I struggle to come to terms with Gucci's “Flora” creations; we do not like each other, despite the tempting fragrance pyramids that always try to persuade me and the dear fragrance friends who enthusiastically recommend them to me.
This time I was ready to try - ""Jasmine"" was the enchanting magic word that lured me in, but I emerged from this adventure quite disheveled."

I had to order it right after because it impressed me as well. For me, this is a great fresh and slightly sweet scent that reminds me of freshly washed laundry. In the drydown, I pick up a note of tuberose (which isn’t actually in it), which slightly reminds me of L'Interdit (My Way as well!). Beautiful fragrance, not surprising, after all it was created by Alberto Morillas!"
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine,12/03/2023,Vary,F,8,,11,Jasmine of creamy tea and fresh flowers - Patchouli almost none,"This is my absolute favorite jasmine accord, the most beautiful celebration of jasmine. Both are present here: the herbaceous-green jasmine tea with creamy milk, but also the fresh jasmine flower from the garden. They sound wonderfully noble and mature together. Someone has created a monument to jasmine here, a tribute, an ode. I love it. You feel fresh and grown-up and botanical and connected to the world. Mega. Patchouli is almost undetectable here, so there’s no comparison with Scandal by Gaultier or Black Opium or La vie est belle - I can hardly sense it, and that says something - at least a factor of 10 less than in the aforementioned."
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine,08/13/2022,BTFireplace,F,8,,7,Jasmine Candy Water,"The scent is a dream.
It is very present. Right from the opening, there is a very prominent, authentic, soft, yet loud! jasmine note followed by a sweet freshness. The fragrance has a long-lasting durability and a great sillage. I think the scent is fantastic. I give it a 9.5 and a clear buying decision."
Flora Gorgeous Jasmine,11/07/2022,MissLisa,F,6,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Fresh Jasmine Scent,"Anyone who likes jasmine will find joy in this.

At first, there is a lot of lemon enveloped by jasmine. You feel like you are in a jasmine field with lemon trees standing at the edge.

Over time, it becomes a bit sweeter, but the lemony note remains present in the background.

A very floral scent that, in my opinion, can also be worn in winter.

Unfortunately, it doesn't last long on my skin. After 3 hours, it was only faintly noticeable, and after 4-5 hours, it was completely gone. It is only still detectable on clothing afterwards."

Flora Gorgeous Jasmine,11/08/2024,Katiee,F,5,,4,Comforting Fragrance,"The bergamot notes remind me of L'interdit, but this perfume is lighter, more floral, and more liberated. After 2-3 hours, it reminds me of the Schauma herbal shampoo from around 2010, which was always at my grandma's... a cozy, nostalgic scent for me. But even without this association, I would embrace this fragrance; it is simply a comforting scent.
Unfortunately, the fragrance fades after just a few hours."

I came into contact with the fragrance through my sister, and I wouldn't have thought before that jasmine would appeal to me so much.. To me, it smells like a wonderful bouquet of flowers with jasmine, but without the heaviness or very strong sweetness of typical jasmine (I know jasmine flowers from my mother's garden), as this often reminds me more of a scent from my grandmother.. Overall, for me, it is a very fresh and floral fragrance with a slightly citrusy note."
Gucci by Gucci pour Homme,03/26/2017,Rmf1112,M,17,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Underrated Gucci,"This one gets much hate, undeservedly so, in my opinion. I feel the mistake many make is to use the same measuring stick to judge all fragrances. Not every scent should be noticed from across the room, or be expected to last over 8 hours- Subtlety is sexier than being overt and in your face. That being said, I think this performs fine, on par with most fragrances. If you look on the other site, there are many unsolicited reviews from women also for this, so I feel this needs more accurate representation on this site also. Yes, the one review here is from a woman, and she is entitled to her opinion, but I would like to share the fact that others do indeed enjoy this Gucci. In fact, most of them say it is indeed sexy and mysterious, check for yourself.

So, anyway, this is a nice tobacco-violet based scent with the cypress providing the interesting nose tickle in the similar vein as aquatics do. It isn't the most favorite in my collection, but puts a smile on my face whenever I sniff it, and I think more folks should give it a try. Also, the bottle itself is handsome, a timeless classic in its shape and feel."
Gucci by Gucci pour Homme,07/17/2023,Shemsmeller,M,206,,2,The best Gucci classic collection for me,"bought in the summer of 2011, I tested it in perfumery in 2009, I found it fantastic.

it is a perfume that I appreciate wearing on summer evenings for its refreshing and elegant side.

It's really hard to describe, one has the impression that this perfume was made for an elite, I can easily imagine a cosa nostra sponsor wearing this type of perfume, for an occasional dinner.

a perfume of seducer which it seems to me is no longer marketed in stores in France.

if you have the opportunity to test it do not hesitate I find it underrated."
Gucci by Gucci pour Homme,02/05/2012,Missk,F,1357,,0,Gucci played it safe,"Gucci by Gucci pour Homme is certainly nice, but a little too safe in my opinion.

A sales assistant described this fragrance as being sweet, however I do not agree. I'm also not very convinced that this is a woody chypre.

I'd say that this fragrance is more of a woody aromatic. The scent is refreshing, masculine, yet bland. A little like Only The Brave by Diesel.

The cypress and bergamot opening, while somewhat unique, needs more strength. I appreciate that Gucci wanted to produce something modern and stylish, however they failed, creating something rather generic.

Gucci by Gucci pour Homme ""is not meant to be vibrant, virile, sexy, attractive to women, refreshing or fancy."" However from a female's perspective, women like their men to wear a fragrance that is memorable, something that they may smell elsewhere yet connect to you with fondness. This fragrance just doesn't seem to have that ability.

The scent dries down to something rather musky and subtle. Unfortunately the unique notes like elemi resin and olibanum aren't standouts here.

The lasting strength is very poor, terrible in fact, which is very disappointing. I do still recommend this fragrance, however not with upmost enthusiasm."
Gucci by Gucci pour Homme,02/10/2025,BlazedFenton,M,8,,1,Victim of much confusion (and possibly reformulation),"It seems like Gucci by Gucci pour Homme is the victim of many misconceptions. Reviewers seem to confuse it with a multitude of other scents, it gets heavily criticised for its performance, and Parfumo has the wrong perfumer (I would fix it but if Aurélien Guichard can’t be bothered to claim it, then I won’t force it upon him).

My batch must be 2013; I purchased it after a girl I knew chased a man down the street to ask what he was wearing, and then she insisted on my buying it. The girl didn’t work out, but I continued to wear it for many years in the winter months. I never really had any issues with longevity - it doesn’t last a whole day at work, but it’ll get you 3/4 of the way there.

As to the smell, without breaking it down to notes, it’s a spicy, green and slightly woody fragrance. I’m not sure if my tastes have changed and I used to like it more, or if 12 years of improper storage have ended it, or simply smelling other top-quality fragrances have moved this down in the pecking order.

It’s still pleasant but inoffensive, a good office scent, and the Parfumo score of 6.9 is very harsh (it may have been reformulated and be worth such a score), but I have to admit that it’s not worth seeking out or buying."

Gucci by Gucci pour Homme,03/14/2010,Apicius,M,1328,,8,Cheap,"Gucci by Gucci pour Homme - not to be confused with Gucci pour Homme - is another easily available and mid-priced fragrance from this brand.

Right upon spraying, you notice: This is nothing special. What I primarily smell here is - average. After about a minute, a scent begins to develop: it is somewhat soapy, a bit vaguely floral, slightly aldehydic fresh, but also sweet, voluminous, and broad. A type of amber is probably responsible for this. Additionally, there seems to be a kind of musk involved. The florals are the most pleasant aspect of the fragrance, but you can find better ones elsewhere.

The notes read interestingly, but the execution does not match. I bet cheap synthetic fragrance materials have been used here. In a blind test, I would have considered this scent more of a representative of the cheap segment. A truly off-putting example of a designer fragrance. What a quality difference between this perfume and the spicy Gucci pour Homme!

My recommendation: Stay away!"
Gucci by Gucci pour Homme,04/05/2010,Maulwurf84,M,48,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,My Current Favorite,"Season:
actually year-round, but in winter the scent has no chance of survival

Age:
25 and up

Suitability:
good for the office; I wear it for going out and for special occasions

Intensity:
varies: In winter, the scent fades within a maximum of 2 hours, even if you spray 12 times (!). Now in spring, it looks better. I use it together with the ASB, still have to spray a lot, but it lasts between 6 and 12 hours. I myself perceive it only very faintly, but I have been approached about it several times, so the projection is fine. GbG is more of a subtle scent

Fragrance:
At the start, the scent comes across as very cool and fresh, I even perceive slight aquatic notes, in the heart note, jasmine clearly emerges and makes the scent a bit more lovable. Additionally, I also detect a leather accord, on some days it reminds me of synthetic leather, which I don't mind at all. Amber and tobacco in the base give the scent warmth, not necessarily sweetness, but prevent it from becoming too bitter.

Conclusion:
I love this scent! I have searched for something like this for a long time and have finally found it. GbG is very balanced: fresh without being citrusy or significantly aquatic, and warm without being sweet or overly woody. The scent is very modern, yet somehow also comes across as classic; it doesn’t drift into the unisex category, but it’s also not overly masculine. The Gucci fragrances (my favorite label, by the way) are all very natural, but this one is the most synthetic among them, yet it’s not a chemical bomb. I also find it to be the least spectacular, but I like it the most and it’s the easiest for me to wear. GbG comes almost 100% close to my ideal concept of a (men's) fragrance and leaves me with hardly any wishes unfulfilled. This is how I want to smell.
GbG has faced a lot of criticism: too tobacco-heavy, too synthetic, not a real chypre scent, etc. I think it is good just the way it is and currently my favorite scent alongside Mania. On the other hand, I can certainly understand that many people, including myself, find this scent boring or even bland. It is certainly not a masterpiece, but it smells as if it were made just for me, so to speak, by request.

P.S.: Before buying, definitely test it on the skin multiple times. Many people, including myself, have significant issues with its longevity."
Gucci by Gucci pour Homme,06/21/2021,Schorschle,M,7,,4,"Hardly there, and it's already gone.","Something about this fragrance has captivated me. I love this composition. ""Fresh-Spicy"" really hits the mark here, especially an incredible lightness of being that I can sense. And the interplay of freshness with the tobacco and floral notes is truly wonderful. It suits every season and every situation, doesn't bother anyone, delights everyone, brings joy and good mood. I want to smell like this all day, every day!

Unfortunately, this is exactly the central problem. The whole day only becomes enjoyable with intense and frequent reapplication. The longevity is really incredibly poor; after two hours, the fun is over for me. Even with my nose right at the spray point, I can no longer catch a whiff of that wonderful scent. For that, the little potion - even with Gucci on it - is definitely too expensive for me.

In summary, I can only give a good rating for the fragrance and the massive bottle; unfortunately, the other criteria really fall through the cracks. What a shame!"
Gucci by Gucci pour Homme,12/14/2012,Leimbacher,M,2870,,4,Gucci Bye Bye Gucci,"Mamma mia, what a flop, almost a farewell to the great Gucci times. The brand Gucci really shoots itself in the foot with such extreme disappointments like Guilty or By Gucci - not absolute stinkers, but so insignificant that the fragrances would probably smell worse than most drugstore scents at the bottom shelf and would fade away without a sound.

I like the first 10 minutes, the top note. There’s a slight hint of Gucci feeling - but then it’s gone for the next 7 hours. I was just shaking my head while testing it on my wrist. They take such highly regarded classics like PHI off the market and come out with something so banal. Luckily, my PH II on the shelf still reminds me of the glorious times of the brand. But something needs to change in the coming years to avoid being completely out of favor with perfume fans, at least the gentlemen.

The bottle is great, solid and heavy, the spray head is also of high quality. The sillage is hardly present and the longevity is in the gray average of 6-8 hours.

But the scent itself is partly unbearable; I wouldn’t want to smell like this at work, in my free time, let alone at fancier events. Not even while exercising. The short initial minutes are intense and thick, like a better version of Guilty, fresh yet spicy and a bit gourmand. But then it’s just a light freshness, nothing behind it. As if they had cooked this scent on low heat, a bit too much synthetic notes come through, smelling somewhat like fresh experiments in a chemistry lab or a sewage explosion near heavy industry.

How can Gucci invest so little in a new men’s fragrance!
Keep your hands off and raise your fist for a boycott!"
Gucci by Gucci pour Homme,11/13/2014,Nasengourmet,M,54,,4,Quick to Wash Off....,"I can't evaluate this perfume because I suspect it is somehow psychologically linked to a negative experience for me. At least no other perfume has ever caused such a strong feeling of disgust.

This initially exaggerated freshness combined with a chemical ""BASF note"" and a third citrus note (like Mr. Clean) is totally shocking. I've tested the scent several times now to perhaps find out what disgusts me about it. In any case, I could hardly wait to wash this smell off again.

But it lasts a very long time; you can even smell it the next day.

I think as a teenager I wouldn't view this scent so critically; it somehow reminds me of pubescent youths in the village disco. To my nose, it smells extremely cheap. If I didn't know it wasn't a cheap knockoff, I would guess it came from a discount store and was marketed under the name ""Chipper Propper Citrus.""

This is the first perfume I've tested where I can't give a rating on the scent because it disgusts me so terribly. Even if a sexy woman in stockings were to wear it, I would run away in disgust. Sorry for my directness; I don't mean to speak poorly of it, but apparently my brain has a negative association (or whatever it's called) when I smell this fragrance."
Gucci by Gucci pour Homme,06/21/2010,DerThomyDer,M,33,,9,Money doesn't stink! - or how I opened an account at the Gucci Bank,"Gucci by Gucci pour Homme smells to me like an exclusive bank. One imagines the scent of old banknotes, futuristic designer steel furniture, noble tropical wood veneer, and sinfully expensive designer suits and costumes made of silk, cashmere, and virgin wool. Unfinished granite and marble flooring also come to mind.

I enter and am greeted warmly but reservedly. Opening an account goes smoothly, but it is not exactly cheap. Everything feels very trustworthy and conveys a sense of being ""well taken care of.""

When I briefly leave the bank and take another look at the cool steel-blue shimmering glass facade of the bank, it becomes clear to me that the only thing I will ever have at this bank called Gucci is a regular checking account. Nothing more, but also nothing less. But at least the interest rates are moderate. And in today's times, that's already worth something."
Gucci by Gucci pour Homme,03/27/2014,Shamrock,M,39,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Elegant Restraint,"That Gucci still has it, even if not like in the eighties, has been proven with Gucci pour Homme.
It has not become a loud fragrance experience, but rather a refined scent that fits well in a Victorian-style office, and thanks to 800 years of English architecture, we have quite a few of those to offer.

The bottle is, in my opinion, very understated and serves excellently as a projectile if one is attacked. When you hold it in your hand, it feels very high-quality and heavy.

However, since it is more about the content, it is rather a very pleasant scent that is somewhat underestimated. Not a masterpiece, but certainly appropriate for the office. Stylishly Italian, with English restraint.
When I sprayed it, the first thing that came to mind was amber and leather, reminiscent of an old Italian villa, not musty, but elegantly furnished, and the owner is by no means someone who wants to show off what he has.
A count in Friuli would probably wear this scent, paired with tweed, corduroy pants, and a shirt. Someone who has survived from the old times when people did not flaunt but were aware of their status and wealth. Not a scent for the wannabe rich of this world, for whom Guilty is the perfect accessory.

So Gucci still has it, albeit with little refined sophistication, but good enough not to offend. Basically, an everybody's darling and all-round scent for the office."
Gucci by Gucci pour Homme,01/11/2013,FLUidENTITY,M,246,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,"""Modesty is the worst form of vanity.""","This quote by François de La Rochefoucauld summarizes the main character trait of Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme quite well. The fragrance is, as has been frequently mentioned, a quiet connoisseur. It remains very reserved on the body and does not feel the need to push itself to the forefront. It also quickly becomes rare and fades away.

I find the scent starts off quite multidimensional. It combines freshness, spiciness, and sweetness. However, none of these three facets dominate the others. Everything is present; the fragrance has so much potential and means, but it doesn't want to reveal everything. Primarily, it shows what it can do.

There is also a certain tension because you don't know which aspect will prevail. After a few hours, it is the freshness that lasts the longest. However, its sharp contours from the beginning have softened. The scent feels a bit unstable and doesn't quite know where it wants to go. It may start to drift because the sweetness and spiciness are still there, but not everything is in its firm place as it was at the start. The sweetness is the amber, I assume. Initially appealing, it loses its strength towards the end. The floral component of jasmine also becomes somewhat disruptive in the potpourri after a while. The spiciness is the tobacco. I find it very stylish and well integrated into the overall composition.

Overall, I find the fragrance to be beautifully multifaceted and noble; I would want to say that, so as not to give the impression that I dislike the scent. However, compared to others in this price category, it falls short because Gucci's price expectation is really steep. I also don't understand why the largest size is 90 ml and the 100 ml is withheld. For that price, one could at least expect 100 ml.

Conclusion: A well-structured and built fragrance at the beginning, which wobbles over time, becomes unhinged, and allows swimming and chaos to break out, failing to maintain its level over the full distance."
Gucci by Gucci pour Homme,08/06/2010,Sol1d,M,2,,7,very pleasant business scent,"I recently came across this scent with an acquaintance. We quickly met for a beer at the bar after work, and then I suddenly smelled this fragrance. For me, it was a “WOW” moment. “Is that your scent?” “Yes, at least what's left from this morning,...”. I really liked this light touch of “business scent,” and it just suited a great suit, a nice shirt, and stylish shoes! I appreciated that it wasn't overpowering but fit perfectly into the overall picture. For me, a very successful business fragrance or something subtle for evening events."
Gucci by Gucci pour Homme,07/25/2016,Berzerk,M,8,,2,"Right from the start, the actually interesting scent runs out of steam","Wow, what a bottle! It shouldn't fall off the shelf in the bathroom... the tiles would have a hard time coming out unscathed with that massive glass.
The scent has already been thoroughly analyzed here, for me it is a really very interesting nose-pleaser without any adventurous qualities. Fresh and classic, it comes across and doesn't really clash with anyone. I find it wearable for late spring and also for summer, even now at temperatures around 25 to 30 °C.
After long comparisons, I feel there are certain parallels to Lacoste Red, although the crocodile definitely lingers longer and more aggressively. This brings us to the biggest drawback of Gucci.
Right out of the starting blocks and even before the finish line, it runs out of steam. So it is absolutely impossible to truly savor the scent or perceive any development over a longer period. I would have to keep the bottle with me at all times and at the latest after 1 hour administer several powerful sprays to present the scent to my environment and myself throughout the day.
What a shame, it unfortunately does not fulfill a good price-performance ratio. For the weak intensity and longevity, it is unfortunately way too expensive!"

Well, I unpacked it (I keep all my fragrances in their original packaging) and sprayed it on, not expecting too much, as I didn't remember it very well.
But then it happened - the scent overwhelmed me; it was fresh at first and developed throughout the day into a well-balanced blend of freshness, warmth, and bitterness.
I really liked it from the very beginning of wearing it; maybe I only like it because many others don’t, but that doesn’t matter - I like it, and that’s why I give it 91% (or my mouse gives it 92% :-)).
It may not be the best fragrance in my collection, but after wearing it for a day, I am really excited about it and find it misrepresented by both of you in some way.
However, this is my personal taste, and it doesn’t have to mean that just because I like it, everyone else will too.

Gucci by Gucci pour Homme,04/30/2022,Duftor,M,26,,2,Gucci Gucci,"Having tried many Guilty fragrances, I was very interested in this perfume. The bottle is heavy, typically Gucci, and looks very masculine. With the first spray, a citrus-woody but also very masculine note immediately comes out. After that, it smells a bit like Gucci Guilty, and the heavy woody notes emerge. In the end, it's a combination of fresh, woody, and a little floral notes, which all create a nice freshness.
I don't really perceive patchouli and amber, and since it's an EDT, it actually lasts quite well.
Conclusion: A stylish, elegant perfume with a summery freshness."

Normally, our paths would have parted ways by now - if the remaining five percent didn’t create a somewhat interesting blend in connection with the unremarkable lion’s share.
It may be jasmine, but the main note throughout the entire scent development reminds me more of - a rather synthetic - lily of the valley. It drifts along on an aquatic accord and is cushioned at the back by musk (even though it doesn't appear in the fragrance pyramid here). The sillage is okay, and the longevity on my skin is very good - in the evening, what I sprayed on in the morning is still clearly noticeable.

In some comments here, GbG is characterized as an office scent. I agree, and I find that this type of EdT is quite pleasant for me in the office on some days - even though I generally prefer fragrances that are less inconspicuous. However, the synthetic lily of the valley does push GbG a bit out of the Boss blandness bubble; a tiny trace of extravagance in the adjusted comfort zone."

Best from the line for me. Designer unique-ness done right."
Guilty pour Homme,07/01/2024,Gymnager,M,52,,1,Unique,"I always loved gucci as a brand, but in terms of fragrances I was dissapointed. Guilty Edt was synthetic and so weak, guilty elixir was also synthetic and so sweet, but it was strong. Guilty parfum was AMAZING in terms of smell but again, it was so weak, Guilty absolute was really good, but it was right opposite of the “Mass Appealing” and was just too dark for me to wear. The only gucci left was the edp, so I am here to tell you about my experience with it. Opening is… different. Chili, rose, salt and balsamic vinegar opening is something you would not easily see in a fragrance, especially if that fragrance is a designer. I was suprised at first, then i fell in love with it. Opening is the most controversial and imo the best part of the fragrance. In middle, we see orange blossom and lavender which gives a clean and floral smell and at the base Patchouli and Cedar will give a woody scent. The scent remains dark, woody, mysterious and unique while also staying floral and clean for the mass appeal. Performance is just average. You can expect somewhere 5-8 hours depending on your skin type and you will get about a foot of projection for maybe first hour and it will become a skin scent. Lasts a decent time but it doesn’t projects good. Season-wise it is not fresh enough for summer in my opinion and lacks the strength of sweet notes for the winter, so it will be best for fall and spring, but if you decide to use it in winter or summer, I don’t think people will complain. Price is kind of expensive so definitely buy it on a discount. The biggest pro and con on this fragrance is actually the same: So unique. I definitely like it but I don’t know about the others, I got a few compliments but also some of my friends didn’t like it at all because of the vinegar note. Definitely sample before a full purchase, not suitable for a blind buy."
Guilty pour Homme,09/24/2024,AugustoB,M,31,,1,Creamy and beautiful rose,"It is one of those perfumes that I had to buy because I had tried it, a practice that every perfume enthusiast enacts but few follow through on. This creation offers something that could be classified as unique, in light of the fact that it is difficult to try to associate it with something you have known or smelled before. In my opinion, it is an absolutely unisex perfume. The rose is the protagonist from the start, where the chili pepper shines only a little and then the white flowers appear, mainly orange blossom and almost no neroli, and some woods in the background. I cannot feel the lavender and patchouli, which would give it a rougher and more masculine character. It is not a very evolutionary perfume, offering practically the same from beginning to end. It is fine, creamy, bright, and feels more comfortable in warm temperatures and during the day. It is really charming and distinguished, elegant and quite unique. The negative part is its performance, irradiating moderately around the hour and falling quickly on the skin to die before 5 hours. It is well worth compulsively pressing the spray, and if necessary reapplying, because you enjoy it."
Guilty pour Homme,03/30/2025,jonathUN,M,2,,0,Short but Savoury,"Opens on a strong white whine vinegar and salt, which is interesting and works well for warmer weather. Dries down to a nice spicy rose with a creamy orange note.

Not great longevity or sillage on my skin, the opening notes are there for a very short while before the rose takes center stage (not a bad thing necessarily). After that it becomes closer to a skin scent, that disappears after 4-5 hours. After a couple of hours the rose still remains but the orange blossom is replaced by a weak note of dry cedarwood.

Regardless of what the bottle says this leans heavily unisex with the fresh opening and the later spicy rose offering a sort of sensual discovery closer to the skin, which I would appreciate on both men and women.

Overall a nice and unique warm weather fragrance without aquatic or citrusy notes, which although they're obviously appreciated, can feel rather outplayed by the end of the warmer season. My daily for spring.

Books I associate with this fragrance:
Slow-burning romance. Creeping ever closer until the discovery of the sensuality and warmth buried close to the skin. Alternatively a shorter, romantic story (perhaps reflecting the shorter life of the perfume)

This year, I have made many perfume purchases, mostly inspired by reviews here in the forum. Unfortunately, I have often been disappointed, and I vowed not to make any blind buys for the foreseeable future.
And there it was under the tree, this Gucci. I had zero expectations for this scent, knowing that Gucci is recommended by pretty much no one. I was pleasantly surprised. Right after spraying it, I knew I liked it. A fresh and masculine scent. It immediately reminded me of Aqua di Gio Profumo. I kept smelling my wrist all evening. A sign that I like a fragrance.
The best part is that I had no high expectations and was truly positively surprised. Often in the past, it has been the opposite. Huge expectations, constantly fueled by ""hype."" Bought the fragrance and then thought, ""okay, so this is it!?""

My first encounter with the Guilty line was with the 30ml EdT, which I received as a Christmas gift. This was about seven years ago, and I got the scent because the person immediately thought of me during the first test of the perfume. I quickly used it up and completely forgot about it after a while. When I rediscovered the empty bottle and managed to get a few more sprays out, I realized that I didn't want to miss this perfume in my collection. Unfortunately, I find that the EdT doesn't smell the same as it used to, so I came across the EdP. After the first test, I immediately noticed that I had found what I was looking for.

The perfume has a pleasant spicy character and develops a nice, fresh floral character after a short time. The fragrance is best suited for colder months, and I prefer to wear it when I am dressed entirely in black (like the bottle haha)."

It retains a spicy note, and after a while, the DNA of the EDT comes through. A fine woody note now makes it a delight for the nose. For me, it's a definitely wearable fragrance!"
Guilty pour Homme,07/15/2025,Janick06,M,2,,4,The Beginning of My Journey,"Back then, I entered a perfume store unaware, with no inkling about perfume, and just randomly ""tested"" a few scents. In the process, I discovered this gem. Without knowing which fragrance notes I like or am familiar with, I fell in love with this scent.
It's nothing ""super special,"" perhaps even a bit ""flat"" and not incredibly complex, but it is different from the rest, and that's what gives it its charm. The rose, lavender, and pepper offer a fragrance combination that is rarely found in the designer segment. In my opinion, it is quite mass-appealing yet still not very well-known and not worn much. I was often approached and asked what I was wearing.

In short:
The scent is not characterized by incredible craftsmanship or complexity, but by simplicity and passion. For me, it is a very special fragrance that marks the beginning of my scent journey. I would buy it again anytime!"
Guilty pour Homme,10/20/2025,LeonGFX,M,3,,2,Love at First Spray,"In 2020, I stumbled upon this fragrance quite by chance. I had actually bought a different perfume, and in the packaging was a sample of this perfume. Without any great expectations, I sprayed it on; to be honest, I had never really engaged with fragrances until then. But at the moment I caught the first whiff, it was clear to me: “I need a bottle of this.”

The scent exudes pure authenticity and confidence, without being too intrusive or too feminine. The rose is perfectly integrated here - it adds character without tipping the whole thing into softness. On the contrary, to me, the fragrance feels strong, self-assured, and elegant at the same time.

Even today, years later, I still consider it one of the best designer fragrances I have ever owned. It has that certain something that is hard to describe. Something that clearly sets it apart from the crowd in its price range. A perfume that you don’t just wear, but that accompanies you and stays in your memory."
Guilty pour Homme,08/31/2025,RudiMentaer,M,9,,3,"For me, it should rain red roses","I sometimes struggle a bit with roses. Sometimes too dominant, sometimes too piercing…
Here, nestled between lavender and orange blossoms, they come softly and show themselves at their best.
And if it weren't for a subtle hint of wood and neroli in the background, the scent could easily be classified as ""pour femme.""
But as always, the rule applies: Don't let the label drive you crazy.

The fragrance is fresh right upon spraying, then immediately floral, slightly sweet, a bit salty, and only in the drydown does it become slightly woody. Above all, it consistently smells good. I am truly smitten. Equally modern and timeless.
This extremely harmonious mixture of fragrance notes makes it wearable year-round and for all occasions. For any gender, for any age. I really can't think of a situation where it would be inappropriate.
The bottle is perfectly fine, the sillage is understated but definitely present. The longevity also gives no reason to complain. Only after 6 hours does it become close to the skin for me, which I can live with perfectly.
Last but not least, it can be purchased very cheaply if you just look around a bit. All of this makes it the perfect daily scent for me. And if it weren't for its big brother ""Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme | Gucci,"" it could have even become my signature scent.

There’s just one question left at the end, since it is Gucci:

Does it squeak?

Yes, but really only at the immediate moment of spraying. After that, it comes across very mature.
As long as the scent and I exist, I will keep repurchasing it."
Guilty pour Homme,10/06/2024,Dionysos2022,M,945,,1,With the Gondola over the...,"... Canale Grande in Venice. Sitting in the gondola with me is my beloved in my arms. In her hand, she holds the rose I bought her earlier. We dock at St. Mark's Square and walk arm in arm across it, looking for a small café where we can have a cappuccino. We gaze dreamily into each other's eyes.

Upon applying this fragrance, the first thing that hits the nose is a slightly sharp rose scent. This is accompanied by a slightly sour salty note. Floral and woody accords mix with these. The patchouli adds a dark note.

The longevity and sillage are good.

This is again a fragrance for men from around 25 years old. It can be worn all year round, both during the day in the office or gym as well as in the evening at a club or for dinner.

Those who enjoy a floral woody slightly sharp fragrance will find themselves well accommodated here."
Guilty pour Homme,02/06/2024,Niklas1311,M,1,,1,Spring in a Bottle,"I think Gucci Guilty is a top fragrance for spring. Since everything starts to bloom and smell nice again in spring, Guilty always reminds me of fresh flowers. With its floral scent, it is very subtle but still has good longevity. I like to wear it to not stand out too much but still smell good. The price-performance ratio is also fine."
Bamboo,11/28/2017,LauraBella,F,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,"Regrets, with a ghost of musky honeysuckle.","I regret this perfume. I tested it before I bought it, but I had tested many that day, and I believe nose confusion led to this purchase.

It feels murky, like watery leftover perfume notes muddled together. Not stinky, not memorable, and no solid personality of it's own. The one thing that saves it is that it has a little depth and not being overly bright. It does feel somewhat anchored, but unfortunately it's anchored to nothing. Though the scent is listed above as ""flowery fresh,"" I think it's flowery, but not fresh.

It's floral but foggy. If this smell were a color it would be smog gray. Floral notes are easily discerned, and I do get a whiff of the bergamot (although this isn't a citrusy perfume). And I realize this isn't a musk, but it reminds me of one. Likewise, there is no honeysuckle note, but the blend of florals creates a reminder of honeysuckle.

This contains vanilla, but I do not smell it at all. And there's literally nothing sweet about this.

I don't hate it, but I regret it. Trying to use it up, but I won't repurchase. I'm never excited to wear it."
Bamboo,12/18/2017,Jupita,F,47,,18,Luxurious Immersion,"Gucci Bamboo is currently my absolute favorite perfume. It is also the only one for which I receive compliments when I wear it. I simply love its fresh scent, and it lasts easily from 7 in the morning until late at night. However, it does not smell like bamboo, as the name and the closure of the bottle would suggest.

I also do not perceive the bergamot as indicated in the heart note. Rather, I notice the trio of lily, orange blossom, and ylang-ylang. I also detect this in the base, along with a hint of sandalwood. Amber and vanilla, on the other hand, are not noticeable to me; the scent feels more aquatic.

Oh yes, and I have one warning: Do not spray the perfume on light-colored clothing, as I suddenly had purple stains that, however, came out with intense washing."
Bamboo,07/23/2015,Ergreifend,F,528,,24,I Am Here!,"- screams Bamboo rather hysterically into the crowd.

The newcomer among mainstream fragrances. Gucci presents a rather heavy bottle with unfortunately mediocre content. I didn't have much expectation for it, and accordingly, I wasn't particularly disappointed when I tested it. A rather floral scent that initially packs a punch but quickly proves to be extremely short-lived. Typical Gucci. It has been a long time since anything has hit the market that showcases uniqueness or even quality.

The scent starts off quite floral, with a dense cloud of something cardboard-like. Chemistry kit ahoy! Furthermore, it has a slightly piercing, hissing note that quickly spreads thickly on the skin. Bergamot? Where? It starts off very dominant. The flowers are quite entrenched in the fragrance pyramid. Ylang Ylang is particularly stubborn here and puts all other components into a coma. Subtly, there is a bit of orange blossom, but it completely withers under the power of the Ylang Ylang.

After this opening, the scent then becomes distinctly sweet, fruitily tinged. Again, this strange cardboard thing. What could that possibly be? The vanilla comes in lightly, but unfortunately in such a disastrous state that it almost makes me shudder. Bamboo doesn't make great leaps; it becomes slightly woody in the dry down, but this unpleasant cardboard quality remains until the end. Ylang Ylang is strongly present throughout the entire fragrance journey, but for my taste, it's far too much of a good thing. Everything is overshadowed by this ingredient.

Bamboo hysterically screams that it is here and that it is oh-so-elegant and feminine. It hisses petulantly at the beginning, letting out all its strength and intensity. Strong, yes. At first. Intense too. Intensely chemical. Nothing feels natural, just overloaded with Ylang Ylang. After not even a short time, the scent then dissipates into nothing. It only smells floral, with slightly different, tipsy ingredients that somehow want everything but can do nothing.

The bottle is heavy, fits well in the hand. It is of good quality, in contrast to the content. The longevity is actually a joke at this price and presentation. Sillage is not even worth mentioning.

Gucci sends a real stallion into the race when you think of the advertising, and what happens then? The stallion quickly runs out of steam.

Seduction? Desire? Feminine, perfected elegance? Not a chance.

There is a real deception here. Bamboo seems really intense, noble, and extremely strong in its presentation at first sniff. But all of this is misleading. Many, especially people outside our circles, buy perfumes if they like the sprayer right away.

Gucci is slowly going down the drain. With this fragrance, they haven't done themselves any favors. It is nothing new, not horrendously bad either, but any low-cost discount fragrance can claim that. And for 5-10 times less euros."
Bamboo,09/11/2017,NadsSpatz,F,596,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Bamboo? Lilies!,"~ Inspiration ~
I became aware of ""Bamboo"" here and it landed on my watchlist until I received a sample to test during a swap.

~ Bottle ~
The thick glass bottle contains a delicate pink liquid. In keeping with the name, the cap looks like a bamboo stalk.

~ Fragrance ~
Bergamot provides a citrus-fresh opening, while Casablanca lilies give it a green-floral character. I perceive ylang-ylang only in the background with a handful of orange blossoms. In the base, it finishes lightly creamy with sandalwood and vanilla.

~ Longevity ~
On my skin, it lasts about 5-6 hours. A few sprays are enough, as it becomes too piercingly synthetic for me otherwise.

~ Occasion ~
It fits into the mild days of spring, summer, and autumn (also suitable as an office fragrance).

~ Conclusion ~
It is too unsweet/synthetic for me, and the piercing green lily bothers me. More for fans of Asian-aquatic scents."
Bamboo,07/28/2015,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,7,rented,"My mom has rented the Gucci fragrances for herself.

Not that I don’t like them - I get along well with Guilty Intense - but otherwise, the Guccis just suit my mom better.

Therefore, I don’t want to stick my neck out too far with the assessment of Bamboo, as I haven’t smelled it on her yet.

On me, however, Bamboo comes across as quite unharmonious - almost shrill.
The bergamot speaks up loudly, and it is not calmed by the lily and the orange blossom.
The opening feels intense and agitated.
Ylang Ylang stands separately beside it and doesn’t blend in.
Neither the sandalwood nor the vanilla really smooth the restless scent.
I also can’t find the expected bamboo.

A fragrance that leaves me perplexed and nervous.

But, as I said, the final word has not yet been spoken, as I haven’t smelled Bamboo on my mom yet.
Maybe it will surprise me with its good sides on her.

I found the beginning absolutely wonderful - like whispering bamboo in the wind on a cool, dry summer morning. Will this be my new scent?
But after a few minutes, I smelled mandarin, nothing but mandarin. Everything else remained blurred in the background. Only after 10 hours did the desolation fade, and after 12 hours, I liked Bamboo again.
Beautiful scent but not on my skin."
Bamboo,07/25/2017,KaliP,F,20,,5,fresh soap bubble,"A clearing opens up to me in a mix of dark and light green tones. White sunbeams touch large waxy leaves in a vine-draped, impenetrable jungle. The air is fresh like the morning and yet strangely warming. Pale wisps of fog lazily swirl between the bright, smooth trunks of nameless, branchless trees, shimmering in the light bluish yellow like wet opals. Sparkling droplets run down the leaf veins and collect in deep green funnels at the heart of tropical plants.

A hint of sweet-sour fruits wafts in on a gentle breeze, unripe apples and figs, juicy bergamot take their time to unfold, only to then blend into one another.

As unadorned as a sample bottle may be, this fragrance requires no grand embellishments. Gucci Bamboo accompanies the sophisticated woman of the world on a snow-white yacht in the harbor of a glamorous city. It joins her for a fruity-sparkling cocktail on a rooftop terrace, so high up that the street noise no longer reaches her. It is with her at the important meeting in the office, where she must be particularly eloquent and confident. Because it decides her career.

Afterwards, she throws her cotton-white blazer over her shoulder and treats herself to a new pair of sandals. The expensive ones. For success.
She knows what she wants. She is completely in her element and simply magnificent.
She is a better version of herself.

It's a pity that the scent dissipates as quickly as a soap bubble bursts. A fleeting accessory for the moment, not for eternity. Not for me."

... luxury, glamour, exclusivity ... that’s what I associate with the name Gucci

This fragrance does not quite match these associations.
The bottle is a noble eye-catcher, no question about it.
But the scent has nothing noble for me. It rather impresses with its everyday suitability.
It starts very fresh and citrusy with its bergamot top note, and the sandalwood from the base notes joins in early. These two ingredients accompany you throughout the entire experience. I cannot separate the floral ingredients of the heart note individually, but they are clearly arranged as a floral bouquet for me. However, it feels like too much of a garden show and somewhat intrusive.
Vanilla? Yes, it was indeed listed on the ""recipe,"" but it seems to have been forgotten in my bottle. But my olfactory cells are more trained hobby sniffers than fragrance professionals.
Overall, I would rate this fragrance as sporty fresh and suitable for the office.

Guilty Essence,08/08/2022,GeorgeReid,M,37,,3,Should've Name it Guilty Green or Guilty Sport ...,"I sampled Gucci Guilty Black recently at Sephora on the Upper West Side in New York City. I liked the smell enough on my skin to buy it despite the mediocre rating on Parfumo.

However, there is a good reason for the run-of-the-mill ratings it has.

----

Guilty Black opens with a combination of lavender and light powdery/floral smell that makes it lean hard on the fresh side, with a light touch of sweetness.

The smell transitions to a mixture of woods and a minuscule touch of leather in the heart and base note, which plays nicely in an easy transition from the fresh notes, while maintaining a soft masculine scent profile.

It is a solid overall fragrance that is complex and easy enough to use (more on that later). However, the fresh/woods combination profile is ubiquitous with men’s fragrances in the current era due to how well it works. Guilty Black will disappoint someone looking for a unique scent profile, as it's present in many sports-like fragrances.

That disappointment is exponentially higher with people who knew Gucci’s creativity with fragrances in the past, and the lack of creativity in recent times. Effectively, Guilty Black is Guilty Intense, minus the lemon note and switching Amber with Leather.

----

A standard 100 ml bottle of Guilty Black is solid. Functionally, like any bottle in the Guilty line, it is slim and easily fits in one’s hand like a smaller smartphone, making it easy to spray and carry around in a pocket or bag.

I also like the green and black combination that Guilty Black has going on, giving it an attractive designer style. However, the bottle is not an artistic masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination.

----

In terms of performance, Guilty Black may not be up to everyone’s expectations.

For longevity, Guilty Black lasts for about four hours. That period can work for a date or a short meeting. However, it is nowhere close to lasting for an entire workday without a respray. (Good thing the bottle is easy to carry.)

In terms of sillage and projection, the fragrance does not project far from the skin, and the scent trail it leaves is faint. Do not expect Guilty Black to announce your presence as you enter a room, or even when you walk by a person. However, someone close to you would almost certainly appreciate the scent, as it will not overwhelm them.

----

Guilty Black is a versatile fragrance. However, it shines brighter in some scenarios, and weaker in others.

For example, in terms of season or climate, it works best in the milder temperatures of Spring or Autumn, or if someone is in a mild climate like San Francisco or London. The fresh aspects of the scent should make it workable in the summer months without cloying or nauseating anyone. While detectable, it does not perform as well in the Winter, which is unusual for a fragrance with Black/Noir/Night/Nuit in the name.

For social situations, Guilty Black is too weak to use in an outdoor event, or a party at a large venue, as the scent fades into the background.

However, it works in every other situation. It can work great as an intimate date night fragrance, especially if one is shifting away from the modern trend of primarily sweet scents.

Guilty Black can also work as a leisurely fragrance, or as a scent after a workout in the gym, because of the fresh and woody aspects at the forefront of the fragrance.

With that said, Guilty Black excels the most as an office fragrance, as it is a fresh scent that does not have the sillage to bother people beyond a personal space bubble.

----

Gucci Guilty Black is a solid fragrance option, but there are many reasons for disappointment. Admittedly, if Gucci called the fragrance Guilty Sport or Guilty Green, the reception is probably better.

However, Guilty Black is the name of the fragrance.

Anyone looking for a winter fragrance that excels at large parties or outdoor events would be disappointed, as most expect that out of Black/Noir fragrances.

Anyone looking for projection or longevity in fragrances will become more disappointed, especially at the price point offered, and knowing that Black/Noir fragrances typically last longer.

The same level of disappointment applies to someone seeking a unique fragrance—especially if Gucci’s current offerings do not impress them.

However, putting aside the negativity, and the silliness of labeling a sport/green scent black, if someone treats Guilty Black like the fresh fragrance it is, they will find a solid daily scent to freshen up at a point in the day in the office, or a potential date night fragrance that is outside the trend.

Edit on Sept. 30, 2024 -- Apparently, Gucci renamed the fragrance Guilty Essence. This is a much better name."
Guilty Essence,06/27/2025,Averycj,M,50,,1,"Solid. Nothing More, Nothing Less","There’s not much to say about Gucci Guilty Black that hasn’t already been said here. It opens with a touch of spice and settles quickly into a familiar green, shower-gel freshness. Clean and smells like you just stepped out of the shower. It’s not mind-blowing, but it smells good in an approachable way.

Calling it disappointing wouldn’t be fair. I’ve come to realize in this hobby that not every scent has to reinvent the wheel. This is the type of scent a guy who doesn’t really care about fragrance picks up at Macy’s just to say he has something on the shelf. And there’s nothing wrong with that.

This isn’t a release made for the serious fraghead or snob. Whether you’re into high-end perfumery or just picking up designers, odds are you’re going to smell pretty damn good either way.

It’s not a standout, but it’s an easy wear and a solid beginner fragrance. It's something to reach for when fragrance isn’t the focus."
Guilty Essence,02/27/2013,Leimbacher,M,2870,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,Gucci now stands for the highest resistance to learning,"Doesn't Gucci read all the devastating reviews, both from experts and newcomers about Guilty and Guilty Intense?
Are the 2 predecessors really selling so well that another attempt at resuscitation is necessary?
Where have the old great perfumers gone who created Gucci PHI and II?

All of this and many more are questions that go through my mind after today's test of the new Gucci release. If one can even call it new, because there is nothing new, great, or improved here. It smells very much like the other 2 Guiltys, and that should not be taken as a compliment. My and many other comments on the 2 say it all.

Guilty Black also has the typical note that swings creepily between gourmand sweetness and watery freshness and light fruit, which does not appeal to me at all. It starts with a greener note than the predecessors, which already indicates the scent color. Lavender is also slightly present at the beginning. Then at some point leather and a bit of patchouli and wood come in, as if the heart note has been skipped.

The bottle also follows the Guilty style, everything remains the same in all respects. Only the longevity has been slightly increased, now at 8 hours. Sillage remains in the gray middle ground, the scent itself has nothing to look for even there after the 3rd attempt. For me, the name Guilty is lost and dead and stands for pure boredom.

Really weak presentation that doesn't need a long comment!"
Guilty Essence,05/30/2013,BackToBlack,M,112,,7,Mainstream Sex can also go horribly wrong,"as Guilty Black also proves..

First of all, I have to say that I am quite disappointed with this scent. One can hardly call it a scent anymore. More like a composite chemical cardboard, where a lab rat somehow made itself comfortable. My daughter said it was like those world-view-shattering rats, Pinky and the Brain. I burst into loud laughter.. Yes, that must have been them ;)

No. Joking aside.

Gucci conveys here, as it could be otherwise, sex appeal with lots of naughty, sweat-driven men who shine and attract all female gazes. The only gaze from women will probably fall on the very uncreative bottle, which is not really enchanting or appealing.
The scent itself is nothing special. You can smell it in every drugstore. So one shouldn't throw money out the window for this one. Better to spend a bit more and get another perfume that is worth its price.

The opening is as prudish as my grandfather and just as bored as he was. I had to chuckle when I think of him pushing his walker back and forth. Cursing and really disinterested. Yes, that's Gucci at the beginning too. Want to soak it up? Not a chance! The lavender is a bit overdone. It reminds me of lavender that stood on the kitchen table for days.. No - I really don't want to imagine that. It's somewhat dull and spicy at first, but it rushes down into the cellar as quickly as my mood after application. A woody touch emerges and everything sinks into a jumble of various ingredients. Sometimes leather comes to the fore, sometimes patchouli, etc. One variation follows another, but the scent doesn't come together.

I have to say, I expected much more from Gucci. Making beautiful eyes at the customers is one thing, but at least 50% should be delivered. Here, it's not even half. We all want sex, and being guilty now and then too. But then the minds behind the perfume should sit down together and rethink things clearly. So I won't get all excited and eager to plunge into the night with Grandma's lavender scent and a carousel of ingredients that don't even want to harmonize.

The bottle is just as uninspired as the scent itself. I give the longevity a bit more than 50%, because once it's been on for a while, it becomes almost undefinable.

Yes Gucci - we wanted fun and mood - you gave us frustration and disinterest.
Mainstream sex is desired, but not always achieved. The only ones who might be reached are boys who are still in the developmental phase.

My conclusion is that the scent is not successful. Unfortunately. Gucci has had some great horses in the stable, but this one is clearly the pony.
The advertising is not bad in itself, but for heaven's sake, create something that screams of touch and fusion if you embody that too. Some might certainly feel taken for a ride.

More than 20 percent is not possible. I don't want to offend anyone who likes this scent, but for me, it is one of the worst men's fragrances in a long time."
Guilty Essence,02/25/2013,Taurus,M,1164,,12,Repeat Offender,"I have already judged the conventional Gucci Guilty in my comment. But now Gucci dares to push another fragrance onto the market with the flanker Guilty Black, a scent that the world does not need, to bore us to death.

What may be touted here and there as fresh and fruity turns out once again to be a synthetically smelling mixture aimed at profit maximization and not a nose-pleasing delight for fragrance connoisseurs.

Yes, with a bit of imagination, I can detect some orange blossom molecules from the test tube. Otherwise, Guilty Black quickly falls back into its musty components. And unfortunately, the shelves of perfumeries are already overcrowded with this kind.

This might only appeal to someone who cares much more about external superficialities and less about inner values.
Because one must admit - the bottle looks absolutely appealing again here. But after the fragrance designer, together with the marketing department, probably blew the entire budget, everything had to be saved on the ingredients.

Therefore: nothing learned and thus guilty as a repeat offender!"

I tested Tom Ford's Noir and Spicebomb by Viktor & Rolf. Since I was in quite an intoxicated..."
Guilty Essence,05/01/2013,Clyde,M,87,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,0,What devil is at work here?..,"..When comparing today's Gucci range with its earlier perfumes, this is a perfectly legitimate question.
Gucci, alongside Prada and D&G, is probably Italy's largest fashion house, and in 2013 it simply has no decent fragrances to show anymore; even worse - they are getting worse with each passing release.

In Guilty Black pour Homme, I see the sad and absolute low point of this brand, and even if I wanted to, I couldn't find anything positive about it in the slightest.
Qualitatively, this creation is at a point where only BOSS and co. would be comparable, as there are now quite a few fragrances that could easily surpass Guilty Black.

Guilty Black starts with a dark spiciness and initially presents a lavender accord. As the fragrance develops, it becomes woodier and so dry that it scratches, and eventually this scent becomes completely indefinable.

The worst part is not even that this was essentially just a polite description of a pure synthetic concoction, but that this fragrance has neither significance nor character; it's really hard to say when I last encountered something more trivial!

To describe Gucci Guilty Black properly, one would almost have to resort to vulgar language, but that doesn't belong here.

The bar couldn't be set any lower. It's just sad that this comes from Gucci."
Guilty Essence,04/02/2015,Cire,M,1,,2,Good Average,"I find the bottle quite appealing, I like it a lot. The scent is a bit overpowering at first when you apply it fresh, which is why I didn't want to take it and left the store. A little later, I smelled the fragrance sample again and I liked it quite a bit. It didn't blow me away, but it was pleasant. I find the orange blossom quite pronounced.
What I also found noticeable was the duration of the scent. Even after hours, I could still perceive the smell."
Guilty Essence,03/21/2013,Chnokfir,M,214,,3,"Guilty, innocent, or just grossly negligent?","In Gucci fragrances, I no longer seek what I once found and cherished a few years ago. But everyone deserves a second or even third chance.

Especially when the bottle shines in such a beautiful green. I have no idea, green currently exerts a magical attraction on me. But maybe it’s just that botched Batman emblem that stands out even more in this black-green color combination than in the predecessors of the Guilty series, which Black shares the bottle with. Not really innovative, but other fragrance houses are even more extravagant in recycling well-known bottles.

The scent starts off quite nicely with fresh green accents, lavender stands out pleasantly. Then there’s a brief and weak hint of something bitter-citrusy, which research suggests should be neroli and orange blossom - but even with this knowledge, I can’t recognize them. What follows is the often-smelled synthetic mush of leather, wood, and patchouli. The lavender quits its service after just an hour and leaves the nose to a sweetish haze.

But how does the scent affect my environment? I had to face the question of whether I was even wearing a fragrance. A somewhat clear differentiation of the components is only possible for about half an hour, after which everything disappears. I am happy to discuss the high pH level of my skin, which has successfully neutralized certain components in several primarily synthetic fragrances, but I have never experienced anything like this. Even one and a half testers in a row dissolve into nothingness in no time.

I am at a loss as to how to rate such a fragrance that disqualifies itself from the race. And unfortunately, the little I can smell is not even in any way great, extraordinary, innovative, or inspiring, but just well-known and ordinary. And that is still one of the best things I can say about this fragrance."
Guilty Essence,09/08/2022,Lasse17,M,1,,3,Nothing special but not bad either,"Gucci Guilty Black and Gucci fragrances in general have totally flown under my radar until now. I smelled this one out of curiosity and without high expectations at a Douglas store and quickly sprayed it on my arm. At first, I was not very impressed and had already written off the scent. A slightly green freshness greeted me. Not exactly exciting, special, or complex to my nose. After leaving the store, I sat down outside in a café. I gave the fragrance another chance and smelled it again. Now it was different. The green note had disappeared. Instead, a slight sweetness had joined the freshness, which was by no means intrusive or anything like that. The cedarwood was already shining through a bit, making the scent feel very rounded and truly pleasant. I found this fragrance to be super calming, unexciting but still somewhat mysterious. At no point does it clash. And that’s probably where we get to the reason why the reviews for Gucci Guilty Black are so poor. With its scent profile, it is nothing groundbreaking or extraordinary. Primarily, it is a mass pleaser that knows how to convince the broad audience with a fragrance DNA that almost no one can hate. Among perfume connoisseurs, such a scent profile is quickly labeled as generic and boring. No question, there are 100 times more exciting and unique fragrances than this one. Nevertheless, Gucci Guilty Black works as a perfume. If you are just looking for compliments, you should definitely take a closer look at this scent. Because if one thing is clear to me, it’s that especially women love this fragrance. It simply works. However, one should not be too stingy with the spraying, as longevity and sillage are rather average."
Guilty Essence,03/28/2013,Sunbeam,M,10,,2,Rather disappointing,"I was looking for a new interesting fragrance. I had the saleswoman show me various products. Most of them left me cold.

With this one, I unfortunately let myself be deceived by the first impression. At first, it smells quite pleasantly aromatic and slightly fruity, but then I perceive - I can hardly describe it otherwise - a scent similar to that found in an African shop. The worst part is: Even if you handle the relatively expensive bottle quite generously and spray yourself properly, you already have the feeling after a short time that there is hardly anything noticeable left on your skin or clothes. You can wait in vain for compliments because the fragrance seems to lose its effect far too quickly.

The bottle shown here looks rather boring, but the one I got looks like this http://www.douglas.de/douglas/D%25C3%25BCfte-Herrend%25C3%25BCfte-D%25C3%25BCfte-Gucci-Gucci-Guilty-Black-pour-Homme_product_723394.html and it definitely has something to it.

Otherwise, I am rather disappointed. Especially for the price, one could have expected more than this interchangeable scent, which could probably be matched by most perfume bottles from the drugstore market."
Guilty Essence,04/20/2024,Temuulen123,M,2,,2,My First Love,"One of my absolute favorite perfumes. The blend of floral and fruity notes is simply beautiful. It has this unique balance between sensuality and elegance. Every time I wear it, I feel confident and glamorous. It was also one of my first perfumes, so it holds a very special meaning for me; moreover, it is truly underrated and deserves more recognition!"
Guilty Essence,02/10/2024,Owennn,M,5,,2,"Good Scent, but Nothing Special","Gucci Guilty was my first real fragrance. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't extremely impressed either. Not a bad scent, but there are definitely better options.
Only suitable for spring and summer. Do not wear it in winter. The fragrance is not very aggressive, making it suitable for a calm day."
Flora Gorgeous Orchid,04/08/2025,posydoodle,F,4,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,my first perfume love,"i got a decant tester of this a few months ago and after the first wear i knew i needed a bottle of this. i can't stop smelling myself when i wear this. it's soooo addicting to me and i can't wait to wear it all summer. gorgeous orchid is pure delicious ozonic vanilla orchid, and it wasn't until i read other reviews that i could smell banana. there's definitely banana laffy taffy in the background somehow but despite hating actual bananas i love banana laffy taffy so it doesn't bother me at all lmao. it's a very yummy scent!"
Flora Gorgeous Orchid,06/19/2025,ssydlo,F,59,,2,From Dislike to Love,"I didn’t expect to love Flora Gorgeous Orchid - in fact, when I smelled it in store first I was unimpressed and even disliked it, so I wrote it off. Then I tried ""Atheeri / أثيري | Lattafa / لطافة"" and fell head over heels for the scent DNA, so revisited Flora Gorgeous Orchid expecting to not need it since I had Atheeri. Gorgeous Orchid has a banana note at the opening that I can’t get enough of, and to my nose it’s much fruitier and bubblier than Atheeri. I own and love both, and I’m so glad I revisited Gorgeous Orchid."
Flora Gorgeous Orchid,06/06/2025,Xavica,F,311,,2,Vanilla Under the Sun,"This Flora Gorgeous Orchid feels like vanilla under the sun.

One could swear they catch a hint of green banana - not quite ripe - that might have slipped into a basket of exotic orchids. There's also a suggestion of ylang-ylang, calling to mind a faraway island sunscreen - chic rather than loud.

The vanilla reveals itself slowly: neither dessert-like nor oriental, but soft and enveloping. The whole thing has the feel of a holiday.

Flora Gorgeous Orchid may not be groundbreaking, but it has the charm of being simply pleasant. A joyful, well-crafted little sensory escape."
Flora Gorgeous Orchid,04/06/2025,Ursaw,F,166,,2,Uninspired and one-dimensional,"The initial cloud was floral and creamy, like an overly sweet custard. Less powdery than I feared. Not great, not terrible. Ozonic notes were pretty pronounced and made the whole thing almost palatable. At that point I was even kind of hopeful about it. There was potential that once the initial cloud subsides and the fragrance properly opens up, I might actually enjoy it!

Well, that never happened. The ozone was a delight and this perfume's only saving grace for me personally, but it wasn't enough to offset the sweetness. The initial aggressive cloud took about 40 minutes to mellow out (or maybe my nose just gave up by then?), but even past that point nothing really ever changed. There was the basic vanilla, there was the orchid, they were both so sweet that my teeth hurt. If one could get diabetes from smell alone, this thing would probably already be outlawed in a few European countries.

It's hard to put this feeling into words, but I felt like it never became a proper sum of its parts. Like each of the three simple notes were there on their own, never really mixing together into a proper composition. Battling for my attention and overloading my senses in the process instead of working together to create something worthwhile.

It never evolved or changed in a meaningful way, just slowly got less and less obnoxious until it disappeared from my skin completely in about 3 hours. Far from the worst fragrance I came across thus far, but for that price tag I found the execution too cheap and uninspired."
Flora Gorgeous Orchid,09/30/2025,apadeva,F,13,,2,Floral Vanilla,"Pretext: I have tried this scent multiple times at multiple stores over a span of a few months before I finally brought myself a travel size bottle. The scent really grew on me because the first times were just like ""Hm, it's nice but nothing to write home about (and certainly not worth the price tag)"".

It's a lovely take on a floral vanilla that could work well in an office setting as well (as long as you don't overspray like hell). There's some freshness at the start, which might be the base notes (as weird as it is), but I couldn't give you an exact note. It vanishes relatively quickly and becomes a floral vanilla. It isn't the most unique scent but it's a lovely scent that is a nice bridge between more vanilla-forward scents and pure florals. It's sweet, it's floral, it's slightly fresh.

The longevity is not the greatest. It's good on clothes (you can even smell the scent on them after 6-8 hours) but it vanishes very quickly on my skin. I can only get a wiff of it when I really sniff my wrist. Sillage is okay; someone close to you will notice the scent but it isn't one of those scents where a room can smell you before you enter the room. Makes it office-friendly, imo.

I have only beef with the travel size bottle. It looks cheap because it's just yellow glass with a yellow plastic cap (the yellow is a different hue than the glass) and a tiny print of the brand & scent name. The full size looks pretty with the print and I would have expected something alike on the travel size. I think I'm spoiled from 7 Virtues' travel size bottles, which look similar to their regular sizes."
Flora Gorgeous Orchid,10/15/2025,Laertes,F,219,,2,Flora Gorgeous Orchid,"This is one I’d never have thought to try until someone told me it has a banana note - and it does! Lots of banana in the initial spray, which then fades into a sweet, floral vanilla with (you guessed it!) beautifully fresh, clean orchid notes. As it settles it becomes ozonic, which is another thing I love in a perfume and see all too rarely. Not a complicated scent by any..."
Flora Gorgeous Orchid,09/21/2025,Grimdeux,F,17,,2,mango lassi,"This came as a tester when I got Pure Poison, and wow, yes, mango lassi--that's it. I was wondering what was so dripping with syrup. I love the taste of mango lassi. This feels like I spilled it all over my clothes.

The 'ozonic' notes keep it from being too buttery, but it's not enough to hold back the ripe, even overripe fruit. When the vanilla breaks through later, it's almost a relief. Reminds me of the orange Flowerbomb because of the excessive mango, though without any of that one's brisk sharpness.

It's fine if you like fruity and very very (did I say very) sweet. It lasts for ages, you can't scrub off that one little spritz, it's that strong, and there's a very hot pulsing vanilla at the heart of it waiting for you at the end of the day. But I find i cannot stand mango as a scent. Not by Body Shop, not by Gucci. It's me, not you: so, pass."
Flora Gorgeous Orchid,11/01/2025,Raluko111,F,418,,2,Banana-Mango Lassi,"I`ve been giving wide berth to Gucci perfumes, especially this Flora collection. Something about the bottle design didn`t appeal to me, I imagined the scents inside to be boring, average, I don`t know why exactly I never felt too keen to try them. So imagine my surprise meeting this cute mango lassi with banana in Flora Gorgeous Orchid. I don`t pick up much vanilla, just a mash-up of the mango beverage plus that L`Oreal Gentle Kids` Shampoo Banana Flavored, the one in small bottles shaped like colorful yellow fish. It was such a pleasant discovery, a lot of memories, breakfasts in Hyderabad and washing my baby brother`s hair with his favorite American shampoo when he was a toddler. A fun, friendly summer fragrance that I would consider purchasing when I manage to finish something in my collection."
Flora Gorgeous Orchid,10/11/2025,MiraLey,F,17,,2,Perfect vanilla for summer,"I smelled this when it first came out but wasn't wowed. But I'm trying to use up all my little samples I've collected over the years, and I reached for this today. Wow. This is not a gourmand vanilla. This is a gorgeous, feminine, ozonic vanilla that is so elevated and elegant. The ozonic notes make it fresh and absolutely perfect for summer and hot weather. This is a clean girl vanilla. I absolutely would buy this when summer comes around again!"
Flora Gorgeous Orchid,09/24/2025,LadyLane83,F,81,,1,Clean Vanilla,"If I think about bananas and look at the yellow bottle, I vaguely smell banana taffy. But no, this is not a banana scent. It is a creamy vanilla orchid. I typically don’t like orchid but in this it keeps the vanilla from going gourmand while keeping a clean sweetness. My husband thinks it smells like sugar cookies when smelled from the nozzle, but I feel it is much more complex when sprayed.

I was looking for a clean scent that didn’t lean aquatic or citrus for Fall and this smells nice on crisp mornings. I think it will be better for spring though as it is more floral verses cozy.

Longevity is surprising for how soft it is. I can smell it on me for easy six hours, but I like to carry a decant and respray at four hours. There is not a huge sillage, the scent bubble is intimate yet persistent.

A solid okay in my book."
Flora Gorgeous Orchid,09/30/2025,FloVer,F,9,,1,Fresh vanilla,"Oddly enough I would describe this as a “fresh vanilla”. This vanilla is in no way edible or gourmand but nevertheless it’s a vanilla, just one with a lot of floral properties. This is a very “pretty” and romantic scent like a young woman who has her shit together and is happily floating through life. It’s ever so slightly powdery but by no means a truly powdery scent, rather it’s a bit creamy. This one works all year round, from the heat of summer to a cold winter day. Very suitable as signature scent."
Flora Gorgeous Orchid,08/02/2024,Jayvicmay,F,94,,1,It’s okay,"I really enjoyed this fragrance more in the beginning. It smelled like a citrus somewhat vanilla candy, though i did get told it smelled like a citrus cleaner (yikes lol).
Fresh and sweet, really pretty! Then it was more of a sweet (not sugary or gourmand) creamy white floral scent, still nice but not the biggest fan of florals so i wasnt vibing with it as much anymore.
Then after while that sweetness left and all im left with is that creamy white floral but now with a “freshness” to it. Think of the scent of a watermelon rind, that’s the scent that was there mixed with that floral. Not a fan anymore after that"
Flora Gorgeous Orchid,11/12/2025,Scofield13,M,9,,1,Simple but good,"This scent contains just basically orchid and vanilla tones. Thats why it smells very soft creamy and trully elegant. Apart from this statement there are nothing to define about it.

It can be used in daily life or in the evening in every season. Besides it is ideal for the women liking to smell orchid tones inside floral fragrance."
Flora Gorgeous Orchid,02/21/2025,MajaDuft,F,105,,14,My Favorite Gucci Flower,"My favorite Gucci Flower, I also own the pink and Lianen. However, the yellow one is by far the best, which has pleasantly surprised me, as the other two did not blow me away. I am a big gourmand vanilla fan, which is why Gucci Flower Orchid fits perfectly into my scheme. The sweet vanilla is dominant and comes through very well, kissed by vanilla orchid. Simply wonderful and unique, sweet, creamy yet floral and fresh. The vanilla is not too sweet and blends beautifully with the floral scent. The fragrance is suitable for everyday wear and creamy, I like it very much."
Flora Gorgeous Orchid,03/04/2025,UnicornCoco,F,374,,5,Incredibly exciting and a bit disappointing,"I at Douglas: spray on my hand: go outside so I can perceive the scent without influence and I smell: super fresh watermelon and cucumber.

At home: read the notes and almost fall off my chair: so few notes in it and yet it smells relatively complex. However, 0 vanilla!
Quickly looked up ""ozonic notes"" and those must be the ""watermelon/cucumber"" that I perceive. But how can it be that I smell them first, even though they are in the base notes? Very exciting.

After half an hour, very slightly vanilla scents come through, still combined with the fresh character, very interesting.

And then: the more time passes, the more delicious and very realistically smelling vanilla is added, yet until the end with a green note, which unfortunately sometimes almost turns it a bit towards cleaning product for me.

I myself am a big vanilla fan and would have expected a lot from the notes had I read them beforehand. However, I would have been disappointed as well, since it smells too little of vanilla for me, or the combination with the freshness creates something different than I had hoped for. Still exciting and something different, I think."

Flora Gorgeous Orchid,12/28/2024,Artemide,F,3,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,"Vanilla, sweet, warm without feeling cheap","Considering that I don't like vanilla scents at all, this one has captivated me. It envelops you and accompanies you throughout the day, the warm and sweet vanilla orchid, without being too overpowering. However, one should use it sparingly, as it is very intense, like all Gucci perfumes, and can easily come across as overwhelming.

In my opinion, the scent is suitable for any season, but one should keep in mind that it is warm and rich, not fresh."
Flora Gorgeous Orchid,11/15/2024,Kerkyra74,F,669,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Gucci...I don't actually like you,"I don't know how I could fall in love so spontaneously again. I have generally kept a wide distance from Gucci, the perfumes, those who love Gucci, please forgive me...especially the Flora line was, until the orchid appeared, a horror for me. But...you always have new experiences. In one of my various orders, the sample with the typical pattern was included in the box as a little extra....Please no, I thought, I'll give it to someone else. But it's yellow???? Okay, tonight I'm on fire and in testing fever. What can I say, only three notes listed, that's something for me. I smell a powdery, wonderful vanilla. My heart is already beating faster
..No frills, this powdery scent actually reminds me of ""Vanilla Powder | Matière Première,"" just a bit more floral. ...otherwise it wouldn't be a sprout from the Flora line. Simple vanilla meets vanilla orchid. The oceanic notes are still a puzzle to me...please don't think of something fresh, clean, for that the scent is too linear. Compared to ""Vanilla Powder | Matière Première,"" which has a bit of woodiness, I classify this scent as a cozy, comforting candidate for the cool season; this fragrance is direct. It takes no detours, does not change. Suitable for any season...I better stop writing, otherwise I'll end up buying it."

Flora Gorgeous Orchid,08/07/2024,Majka86,F,56,,4,Are you Unisex?!,"The comments here made me curious.

Personally, I can't relate to the entire range.

I think it could be for men. It has such a masculine note. Probably the aquatic one.
Actually, the vanilla orchid is quite nice. Neither artificial nor too sweet.
But it's just not feminine enough for me.

For anyone looking for a truly great, spicy, and deep vanilla orchid note, I recommend ""Black Opium Le Parfum | Yves Saint Laurent."" Only Classique EAU DE PARFUM was comparably vanilla-like. It's a shame it was reformulated.

The longevity is very poor for me. For the price, it's also outrageous.
Maybe it really smells better on men."
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia,04/06/2025,Ursaw,F,166,,2,"""Berry smoothie"" flavored shower gel","It started on a prominent coconut note and something else vaguely fruity. I would never have guessed what kind of berry it is if it wasn't written on the package. No orange at all. Reminded me of those children's fruit flavored markers that give you a headache 30 minutes into the drawing.

Thankfully, the upper notes mellowed out before my headache kicked in. Musk very quickly started peeking through from beneath, giving the composition a pleasantly creamy quality. It basically smelled like those feminine ""berry smoothie"" flavored shower gels (and lasted on my skin just as long). After the first hour most of the top/middle notes were already gone. I was left with just musk and a wee bit of patchouli.

The base notes clung to me for a few more hours, and admittedly I did enjoy that, but if my intention was to just smell musky – there are so many great musk-forward perfumes on the market, many of them with way more interesting compositions and better longevity (and at times for a fraction of the price of this one).

Best one out of the Flora collection, but still meh. Waste of a cute bottle."
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia,01/31/2025,lucekingg,F,157,,2,Unremarkable,I went in Ulta and decided I wanted to test one of the Flora Gorgeous scents after work today so I sprayed this on as out of the four this smelled the most appealing to me out of the bottle. It smells good but it's nothing remarkable or super memorable. It's also didn't find it to be incredibly strong either. I like this but not enough to buy.
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia,10/06/2023,Einfinken,F,74,,1,Good easy reach daily scent,"I did not like the original Gucci Flora or Gorgeous Gardenia, but I do like Gorgeous Jasmine. I've also been on a hunt to find magnolia focused fragrances that work for me, so while I admittedly did not need another coconut fragrance, I ultimately couldn't resist trying this and purchased a 30 ml bottle after testing it a few times in store. It's a newer addition (a month or so) in my collection so these are really all first impressions:

1. Unique? No. But it is however good at what it sets out to be and I don't believe every perfume has to be some olfactory masterpiece. Easy, pretty, light, feminine. Great daily scent for places like work, bed or even just to feel clean.
2. The longevity is good and I get about 5 hours of wear but I find this is a very intimate fragrance that sits very close to the skin. I'm also fine with this because I'm not someone who thinks every perfume has to be in beast mode.
3. This is a very creamy almost waxy smell. I wouldn't say it quite crosses the line into wax soap territory but there is a hint towards it in the notes. This makes sense given it's a Magnolia centered fragrance. Even with the berry and coconut, I personally do not think it leans particularly tropical and the magnolia is still the primary center focus of this fragrance.
4. Because it is so light, it struggles a bit more in the cool mornings so I think this may be one that comes more to life much more in the spring and summer but it could still totally be worn year round if you just want a skin scent.
5. I really like the way Gucci does patchouli. It's not a dirty patchouli at all and in this blend really helps ground the fragrance in a pleasant way.
6. I know it is the juice that matters most, but I really love this bottle and the atomizer on this line. Gucci did a stellar job on the packaging.

Good scent and excited to really see how this performs in warmer months. If I continue to like my small bottle this much, it may be worth investing in a larger bottle when I run out.

Eta: Updating my rating as this perfume has been absolutely beautiful the past few spring months. I stand by it being a good easy reach, daily scent but I've come to really love it. Wearing it alongside the blooming magnolias in my city has been truly a delight."
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia,08/02/2023,Telekinec,F,498,,1,Another designer perfume in an oversaturated market,"Received this as a sampler with a Sephora purchase way back before it was annonced, forgot about it for awhile and now here I am ready, to test it!

I'm going to say it: it smells like baby powder. Floral, slightly fruity, yes, but baby powder above all else. And it's not something I want to wear during the day. I'm already not a great fan of powdery perfumes, so this was already a no to me, but my colleagues told me it had a baby powder scent and that was an even more immediate turn-off. There's clearly a Gorgeous DNA going on here (I smelled Gorgeous Jasmine before and I was reminded a bit of it in this scent). Blackberry was the strongest contender in the top notes with its fruity and tart accord. Flowers sort of blended in a non-descript way, giving everything a powdery accord that ended up overwhelming everything. There's also an adjacent plasticky, almost Play-Doh scent that came up when I pulled my nose right up to my skin, but it's not detectable when I'm at a reasonable distance. Everything ends up drying down to this earthy, warm scent, a welcome contribution from the three bottom notes. I feel like this perfume could've been better blended as the notes and accords do seem to clash a bit during its time on my skin, but I can't clearly pinpoint what should've been done differently.

Overall the perfume isn't bad, it might even be good for those who love floral, powdery scents, but to my nose it isn't amazing enough to add to my collection. I also have the feeling I have already smelled something similar before and I can't seem to put my finger on the name of the perfume. Anyways, I'm just saying that if you do have a floral powdery perfume in your arsenal, you don't really need this one, except if you really love the Gucci Gorgeous line. It's a fine feminine-leaning perfume, but nothing amazing or unique."
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia,06/25/2025,kittea,F,65,,1,Never left the blue-sky stage,"I've spent far longer on this review than it really merits, because I keep trying to figure out what my problem with this scent is. The thing is, I feel a bit cynical about the whole Flora Gorgeous line, and I'm really not sure why. It's not like I need fragrances to be high-concept or anything— some of my favorite perfumes are of the unfocused, as-long-as-it-smells-good variety, and the names promise white florals, which are an easy way into my heart. Just something about these fragrances in particular seems directionless, like they came up with the (admittedly, beautiful) bottle first and then cast about desperately for something to fill it with. Magnolia in particular feels very perfunctory. Fruit, check, florals, check, pick a color for the bottle and call it a day.

Maybe I'm not being fair. This is not a bad scent. It doesn't smell bad. But to me at least, it fails to cohere. The fruity top notes seem stapled-on, like they have nothing to do with the florals they're supposed to prelude. The florals themselves feel thin and textureless. The most interesting thing about this is the patchouli, which, placed in this particular context, does genuinely conjure up for me the scent-memory of a magnolia leaf— grassy, sort of spicy. In a better world, this could be the core that the rest of the fragrance was built around. But this feels like an outfit comprised of individually beautiful pieces, put together by someone with no sense of style."
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia,03/01/2025,Sennie,F,14,,1,nothing outstanding,"white florals with a bit of fruit, particularly coconut, and a bit of patchouli. it does give off an older lady vibe because of the floralchouli combination. i actually think that the other releases in this collection are better. someone mentioned it smelling of dirty berries, which i can pick up on as well."

Flora Gorgeous Magnolia,09/26/2025,LadyLane83,F,81,,0,Good starter patchouli,"I annihilate perfume and for some reason this bottle just will not empty. I simply hate opaque bottles where I can’t see exactly how much fragrance is left. Even though, yeah, they protect the juice better. Bah.

Anyway, this reminds me so much of CH Good Girl. This Magnolia has that same warm, hazy, vanilla/coconut/powder vibe. It’s nice and cozy. I like to wear it after a long day and a shower, before bed. When I try to wear this during the day it fades incredibly quick. Being outside kills it within minutes. Gentle sillage but moderately decent longevity on clothes. Simply doesn’t exist on my skin.

It’s pretty and soft and enjoyable, especially for having a strong patchouli base. Clean, floral, cozy. I have found I really like it in the fall."
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia,10/09/2023,DonJuanDeCat,M,2046,,29,If only it weren't for the Ylang...,"Hello you fanatic scent sniffers! Here I am again, with a new fragrance on the scene! This time a scent from Gucci… namely Flora Gorgeous Magnolia. So, you can imagine that I have no idea what magnolias are and especially how they look, let alone smell… but being the clever person I am, I first took a look at the label of the bottle, because sometimes it shows what the scent is supposed to smell like. Good, right? NOT AT ALL!

Because next to the fragrance were other scents from Gucci, namely Flora Gorgeous Gardenia and Flora Gorgeous Jasmine… and do you know what? All three fragrances have exactly the same label!!! Only the name is different (and the bottle color), but otherwise?…. Great! Gorgeous Gardenia… what are gardenias now? Can I hang them on my windows or am I confusing them with curtains? AAAAAAAAARGHRGHGRHG!!!

So I quickly looked it up on the internet and yes, those pink flowers that take up a large part of the label are indeed magnolias! But why are they also shown on the other fragrances? Shouldn't the other flowers have been in the foreground? Like jasmine? Or those curtains?… I meant gardenias of course… :D

Anyway, the bottles look quite nice in their pastel colors and the labels, so I grabbed one of them and sprayed it on. Soo,… and thus follows my fragrance report!

The Scent:
The scent starts off quite sweet and fruity. The beginning reminds me of something, but I just can't put my finger on it. It could also be that it reminds me of some kind of candy :)
In any case, it smells nice, you can definitely smell the berries, the coconut is a bit more in the background.
A little later, you can perceive the jasmine with its nice, floral sweetness. This initially makes the scent even sweeter. But just a little later, the fragrance radiates a note that I haven't had under my nose for a long time, but I can never forget it because I absolutely can't stand it: Ylang-Ylang.
Wow, Ylang-Ylang has a very distinctive and intense scent that comes across as opulent and, for me, also stuffy, and I actually want to run away, which unfortunately isn't possible since the scent is on my arm. And on the ENTIRE arm, so I can describe it as accurately as possible, uffffff!
If there are ""somewhere"" in the scent supposed to be magnolias (as I said, I have no idea how these flowers smell), then they probably get a bit overshadowed since Ylang-Ylang is the main note for me here and overshadows all the other scents, which I personally find very unfortunate because it kind of ruins the scent for me.
In the base, you still smell the strongly radiating Ylang-Yangs, and there’s always a rather opulent sweetness coming through. A bit of patchouli enhances the opulent impression of the scent a little and makes it a bit more robust. Musk and those light woods, well, I don't think I would have guessed if it weren't listed here in the fragrance notes.
Only in the later base does the strong Ylang-Ylang scent finally weaken, so that now many other notes, mainly sweet scents, become more noticeable again. Thus, the late base is much nicer again, especially when the scent becomes slightly powdery and eventually the lovely musk can be smelled. All in all, a scent that is quite okay, but I don't like it that much because of the Ylang-Ylang.

The Sillage and Longevity:
The sillage is strong, not overwhelming, but if sprayed generously, you will definitely be noticeable for several hours. The longevity is also very good at over 10 hours!

The Bottle:
The bottle is rectangular and narrows towards the neck, where the cylindrical gold cap sits. The pastel violet tone looks nice and fits the theme of the fragrance. The label features a drawing of various plants, with the magnolias standing out, and it is all very nicely done. All in all, a very beautiful bottle.

Conclusion:
So, first of all, I should make one thing clear: namely that my fragrance report, like every other test of mine, is purely subjective. And because I really can't stand Ylang-Ylang, I personally don't like the scent that much overall.

However, I believe that most of you ladies might actually like it. Because it is not trivial or 0815-floral and has many beautiful, sweet notes to offer, although some might find it a bit too sweet.
It also radiates well, lasts long, and you don't smell much synthetic in it.
Fragrance-wise, it is almost an all-rounder, but on very hot days, I wouldn't use it, as it could really come across as suffocating and oppressive.

You could use it well in your leisure time, maybe even for going out, just don't come too close to me with it, he he :D

Well, that’s it from me again. Hm,… I still don't know how magnolias smell, but whatever, by the next time I will surely have forgotten how they even looked!
I wish you all a lovely evening, until next time then :)"
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia,03/27/2025,MajaDuft,F,105,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Floral fragrance that doesn't last long,"I treated myself to the Flora Gorgeous Magnolia alongside 2 other fragrances from the FLORA GUCCI line.
I found the packaging and the overall marketing well done. I chose the purple flanker because of the great top notes and the musk.
At first, a berry scent emerges with subtle coconut notes, and quite quickly, the floral fragrance nuances develop after spraying, dominating the scent profile, which is why we have a more floral than fruity fragrance here. The ylang-ylang notes are very strong, in my opinion.
The musk gives Flora Gorgeous Magnolia a nice warm warmth.
The fragrance is okay for me personally, but nothing I would wear often or that would blow me away; everyone's taste is different.
Unfortunately, the longevity of all 3 FLORA GUCCI fragrances is below average, which I find very disappointing. Overall, it's a nice scent, but nothing more."
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia,03/28/2025,Mina4,F,48,,2,Candidate for the Wish List?,"I have tested the Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia twice already, and both times I wasn't really impressed. But the bottles are so beautiful! This time I was in a store where all varieties of the line were available for testing. Since I was already carrying 5 or 6 test strips with me at that point, I had to choose one - it was the Magnolia, I love the purple of the bottle!

Right after spraying it on, I got a good mood boost. The fruity notes came through very strongly, especially the blackberry and the orange, and in a high-quality way, not cheap or smelling like a teen perfume. At the same time, the sweet flowers were already very prominent, making it truly wearable for adults.

Sillage and longevity are in the good middle range. For the price, it's okay, but there's some room for improvement.

After a while, the base gradually comes through, and I finally think I can smell the coconut note. The (or is it one of the sweet flowers) is a tiny little nuisance for me, so I currently tend not to add it to my wish list. But it is a lovely scent."
Flora Gorgeous Magnolia,05/19/2024,Zenitsio,N/A,2,,3,Fresh Magnolia Scent Fills the Air,"Let's first take a look at the bottle. The design is simple yet elegantly executed: a pastel lilac glass bottle adorned with a golden cap. On it, a textured flower meadow sticker adds to the tactile experience. When we remove the cap and take a spritz, we first encounter a very mild, floral scent that fills the room. Once sprayed on the skin, it warms up, and the initially very mild floral fragrance becomes rounded and refined. For up to four hours, it projects strongly on the skin without fading. After that, it softens, becomes more skin-like, and lasts a total of up to 8 hours, until it is barely perceptible.
At a price of €80 (I purchased it online; higher prices tend to appear in stores), I believe it is a beautiful and gentle scent that holds very well on my skin and has a lovely projection. I mostly wear the fragrance in the office, where every time someone enters the room, compliments are given. The sillage is strong and enveloping, without being unpleasant or even overpowering.
Thus, I recommend it to anyone looking for a spring-like, floral scent that can be worn confidently in close contact with others while leaving an impression."
Gucci Eau de Parfum,09/23/2012,Icekat,F,97,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,"Mysterious, dark and sexy","It is not for everyone, but I adore this perfume. It is unique, earthy, sexy and beautiful. This scent unleashes inner tigress in me. It feels ancient and mysterious – like walking through the ruins of a forgotten, ancient temple and feeling connection to dark mysteries of ancient times.

The composition is sultry and spicy. The opening is a bit sharp with orange blossom and heliotrope, but it goes into middle notes pretty quick and they are so divine. I normally do not like caraway seed in perfumes. But this one proved me wrong. The combination is so harmonious and beautiful. It wraps around me like a second skin and makes me feel so divine. It is strong, dark but silky at the same time. The scent has wonderful complexity towards the dry down where the leather, incense, woods, musk and just a touch of vanilla are in perfect harmony.

Gucci EDP has been my favorite for many years. It has strong and unique character, but that’s why I love it so much. I crave its dark beauty, especially when the autumn rolls in. It is sad that this scent is discontinued now."
Gucci Eau de Parfum,05/10/2012,Sherapop,F,1240,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,An Ode to the Caraway Seed,"As odd as this may sound, GUCCI EAU DE PARFUM is a lovely little ode to the caraway seed. I didn't know this until I saw the notes, but I was certainly pleased by the woody nuttiness which I was unable to identify, and there it was: a double dose of caraway seed!

In its warmth and woodiness, GUCCI compares favorably with DOLCE VITA, but GUCCI has its own distinct flavor--figuratively and literally.

Let us now lament the sad plight of the forlorn caraway seed, so long relegated and promiscuously applied to rye bread, while at the same time scorned from a distance, mistaken far too often by those of feeble sight for a weevil or an insect egg.

The caraway seed, GUCCI has admirably affirmed, has an honorable, independent existence worthy enough to play a central role in a high-quality perfume.

GUCCI evolves very quickly to a subtle, slightly sweet, nutty-woody scent, and its lingering caraway aura would be very difficult for the untutored (suitably apprised) nose to tease out of the other fine spice and chypre elements, in addition to a few flowers and a touch of incense. (This is NOTHING like Serge Lutens CHYPRE ROUGE, which is more like a caraway seed monster to my nose!) Together, the flowers and oriental components combine GUCCI edp to create a sly perfume which draws attention to itself only through its subtlety.

GUCCI keeps her clothes on, but her blouse is made of very sheer silk."

Gucci Eau de Parfum,02/04/2012,Callas,F,187,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Nothing for everybody but still mine,"I have used him for years and this has been a long time.

I have found a rest test and rediscovered him newly by chance now.
The beginning is very tastily, sharply and at the same time soft. Caraway and thyme duel gently with Heliotrope.
I find the interplay of seasoning and lighten sweet ones wonderfully. Whoever doesn't like orange flowers should keep away from it. The Orient fans perhaps should glance at it.

Vanilla opens the base; it then will show itself woody musk and incense. It gets dark and mystical like the color of the smell.

A serious smell is passionate, calming infinitely. I have found a new/old winter partner."

Gucci Eau de Parfum,06/19/2014,MasterLi,M,376,,4,"Very dark, warm, and plush...","Like leather seats in a room full of spices and incense. This is a very dry fragrance, but quite mysterious as well. Has an almost resinous like quality to it. Spicy caraway with deep vanilla. Dry orange blossom in the opening. The ""cherry"" aspect of the heliotrope with the dry leather and incense make it very unique. Can be a little dry, and almost tangy with the spicy-sweet dry-down, but I like it. This is amazing for a female EDP from Gucci. There is nothing quite like this out there these days, and it also develops into an incredibly sexy dark, spicy leather scent on a man. Brilliant!"
Gucci Eau de Parfum,05/25/2012,Yourfoxiness,F,14,,4,just too much.,"i really wanted to like this! it is certainly a well constructed, and very respectable perfume, in terms of both formula and quality. but, as i was afraid, the iris and heliatrope ran right out of the gate with loads of sweet incense, which on me is the instant, and terrible powder bomb! the resinous woods underneath are rich, and fine, the vanilla seductive and slightly boozy, the leather note smooth, and not overdone, and the nutty undertone gives it a buttery, almost ""oily"" cast. there was a light herbal note that dissapeared, and i can detect some flowers drowned in the sweet, srupy juice, but i cannot distinguish, or rescue them. sadly, i cannot get it off my hand. sungular. one drop. so, if you love it, please apply carefully (this test was an old formula) it is a powerhouse!"
Gucci Eau de Parfum,01/26/2012,Missk,F,1357,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Didn't live up to the expectations,"The bottle itself and the darkness of the liquid inside, was certainly intriguing to say the least. Gucci eau de Parfum was one spicy fragrance that I was dying to try.

The opening was good, spicy yet smooth and I saw that this fragrance had potential, however what followed was rather strange. The scent just vanished, it was barely detectable, a wimpering hint of spice the only thing left on my skin.

Where were those enticing flowers, the double dose of caraway seed and herbaceous thyme? I began frantically sniffing coffee beans, almost shoving them up my nose in order to smell a faint hint of something, but to no avail.

It was only about 5 hours later when the drydown began to immerge that Gucci eau de Parfum reminded me of its existance. I can see where the comparison to Dior's Hypnotic Poison comes in. The base is very vanilla with a musky and nutty feel to it. The incense and leather notes are only very faint.

Overall, from what I can gather, Gucci eau de Parfum is intentionally a soft and intimate fragrance, not so heavy with the spices as some may think and quite feminine rather than being unisex or masculine.

What I expected and what I experienced were two different things entirely."
Gucci Eau de Parfum,06/19/2014,jtd,M,484,,3,orange floriental,"I don't think this perfume is made any longer, but I have a pile of carded samples that I bought years ago for $.25 apiece at some old perfume shop. I always liked it in that dirty pleasure sort of way, relishing that cheap thrill of mild sleaziness of enjoying a cheap perfume. 

Trying this perfume again after a few years I realize my mistake. I found these samples at some mistakenly low-price and the made amateurish mistakes of equating cheap with Cheap.   This is a beautiful, simple floriental, one that eschews the genre’s typical diva-ish complexity in favor of simple, well-chosen broad strokes. I smell it as if it is under an olfactory magnifying glass. It's laid out like paint-by-numbers canvas that only has the colors orange flower, cumin and amber filled in. The artist stepped back, realized less might be more and left if in its simple state of beauty.  Perhaps more mainstream perfumers should try this pre-editing, because Gucci EDP smell a little rough at the edges and just right.

This simple structure makes a tightly knit perfume that remains coherent through drydown.  Smelling it years later, it seems like a fragrance that could be released today as a masculine woody floral.  "
Gucci Eau de Parfum,11/25/2015,Vibeke,F,4,,1,Lovely and warm,"This fragrance is one of my favorites. It's spicy and warm. Makes you want to kuddle up under a blanket while drinking cinnamon tea. At the same time it makes you want to explore mysteries or go on an adventure. It incapsulates the feminine secrets and essence. It's a statement fragrance, but at the same time so very private."

It has a unique, warm and spicy smell that I just dive into. Lovely flowers, spices and woods make a whole, that wraps around you, comforting and soothing. Like wearing your favourite winter coat. Or like a dear friend giving you a hug. I met this one in 2003. I..."
Gucci Eau de Parfum,03/06/2015,ParfumAholic,M,257,,38,Gucci's Offending Children,"A few days ago, a dear friend came to visit. Although she originally comes from Bavaria, she looks more like a Scandinavian (blonde, fair-skinned, blue eyes) and is quite sporty. Fragrance-wise, she tends to be ""fresh,"" so we have little in common in that area.

However, this time I noticed right away during the hug of greeting that she smelled quite ""different"" than usual. No trace of freshness, but a hefty dose of patchouli or rather a ""lipstick accord"" wafted around her, delicious enough to bite into. My first thought was ""Ombre Mercure"" by Terry de Gunzburg.

Of course, I had to investigate. It can't be that she just changes her fragrance habits like that ;-)

The solution to the mystery is actually quite simple: The fragrance is Gucci's ""Eau de Parfum,"" and it comes from the collection of her recently deceased mother-in-law. Since she found the bottle ""stylish"" and the scent ""something completely different,"" she gave it a new home.

Since we know each other really well and she probably guessed that I would be drawn to the scent, she kindly brought me a mini. Such friends are priceless ;-))

From the very first moment, I perceive this wonderful lipstick accord, which stems from the glorious iris. Carried by (lush) heliotrope and (moderate) orange blossom (which doesn't push itself to the forefront for me) and slightly softened with thyme, a wonderful scent picture emerges that you can almost grasp.

And although no patchouli is listed, I still imagine smelling it, as this ""lipstick-patchouli accord"" is exactly what reminded me so strongly of ""Ombre Mercure"" by Terry de Gunzburg from the start. A scent that I still really like, but due to its insane density, I can no longer wear and enjoy.

In Gucci's ""Eau de Parfum,"" this accord is not quite as dense and long-lasting, as it is broken and grounded by (finest) sandalwood, (dark) vanilla, (non-sacred) incense, (light wild) leather, and cedar.

All in all, a well-rounded affair, a real ""wow scent""!

Anyone wearing Gucci's ""Eau de Parfum"" should be aware that it is a striking fragrance with absolute presence. However, it is by no means loud or cheap in its effects, but rather mature, noble, effortlessly elegant, exciting, yet unexcitable.

Even though the chosen name expresses more of an understatement, the fragrance has a lot to offer and demands a confident presence. Gucci's ""Eau de Parfum"" is a loud scent, but one with style, charm, and a wink.

A fragrance for a grand entrance in formal evening wear, but just as exciting when paired with jeans and a white shirt/white blouse. For my part, I will certainly wear it just like that (jeans, white shirt, suede shoes) in my free time, because for ""good"" (i.e., evenings) I have my pathetic remnant of ""Gucci pour Homme.""

The sillage can indeed be overwhelming and expansive. As always with such fragrances, the dose makes the poison.

The fragrance color (amber or cognac-colored depending on the light) and the design of the (massive) bottle, with the scent seemingly floating inside, clearly indicate that Gucci's ""Eau de Parfum"" (2002) and ""Gucci pour Homme"" (2003) are scent siblings:

- Both are surrounded by this special scent aura that displays a certain arrogance.
- Both cling very, very well.
- Both show their noble origin.
- Both are of very high quality.

Both.....are unfortunately no longer produced for reasons I cannot understand!

And as I already expressed in my comment on ""Gucci pour Homme,"" I can only reiterate my incomprehension about this. In my view, after these two fragrances, Gucci has not brought anything comparable to the market (except for ""Gucci by Gucci"" for women).

Gucci, back to the roots, please!"
Gucci Eau de Parfum,02/18/2013,Palonera,F,467,,35,For Women. Not for Girls.,"The perhaps most important thing first: A woman wearing ""Gucci Eau de Parfum"" should already possess a certain maturity, that calmness that comes from experience and self-confidence, which cannot be learned but can only be acquired over many years.
Only then - I assert - does a harmonious overall picture arise between woman and fragrance, a symbiosis that goes beyond pure harmony, which I could not imagine to be more perfect.
And definitely not on a young woman, perhaps not even on a woman in her thirties - although or precisely because I was 34 years old when this fragrance captured my heart in the year of its release.

I almost overlooked it when it appeared on the shelf of my then-favorite perfumery.
The Gucci brand was not among my preferred fragrance houses; I found no connection to their creations.
So I initially thought it was a joke when the owner introduced ""Gucci Eau de Parfum"" to me with the words: ""I know it's still too early, but the time for you two will come!""
Given the dark liquid in the bottle, I could not imagine it for the life of me, as it reminded me of ""Youth Dew"" and ""Cinnabar,"" undoubtedly wonderful fragrance creations, but for me still unbearable to this day.
However, the aforementioned owner was also a good friend who knew me and my passion for fragrances very well and had already pointed out numerous fragrance jewels to me that I would certainly have overlooked otherwise - and I have always avoided being rude without necessity...

So I resigned myself to my fate and let Simone take the spraying action - only to walk away highly satisfied with my new treasure five minutes later.
With the clear awareness that I was actually still too young for it - significant age differences have never bothered me in choosing partners, but with fragrances, I paid a bit more attention to compatibility with my reflection.
Our time would come...

""Gucci Eau de Parfum"" was a revelation for me from the very first moment, a spicy-warm creaminess.
Nothing crashed, nothing exploded - the feared olfactory thunderstorm might have played out elsewhere, but not on my skin, which I had bravely held out instead of the paper strip.
Clearly feminine, gentle and very determined, warm and soft, highly elegant and yet strangely warm-hearted, a fragrance spread that conjured the image of a very calm, very confident, very friendly and approachable woman before my inner eye, a woman from whom I was still separated by at least a decade and just as much character growth.
A woman who prefers cream white over night black, for whom long red claws and stilettos are neither a synonym for femininity nor elegance, whose aura places her at the center of any society and for whom personal development is more important than the latest gossip.
A woman whose scent of light leather and noble body cream blends with the aromas of her garden and whose smile always reaches the eyes.
I have no idea if I will one day encounter this woman in my mirror - but it would be a beautiful goal."
Gucci Eau de Parfum,01/05/2016,Gold,F,726,,19,Best Gucci fragrance ever,"It is a full, rounded perfume that was launched in 2002 and smells as if it comes from another era (thankfully!). A slightly sweet, plum-like accord combined with a lot of vanilla, heliotropin, and especially cumin create this fragrance, which also has a light orange blossom note. Very ""retro,"" reminiscent of ""Femme"" by Rochas, but spicier due to the cumin. Hardly available anymore. What a pity! Much better than all the other Gucci fragrances that followed after 2002."
Gucci Eau de Parfum,03/31/2017,Minigolf,F,2512,,17,"Spicy ""Incense"" against Evil Spirits","The ""Devil"" and his minions are driven away by sage smoke and thyme. And it attracts the ""good spirits.""
This scent makes no compromises here, just like Van Helsing with Count Dracula.
And like the ""Gucci EdP,"" it ""packs a punch."" Not even the cape remains, just a cloud of fine dust that the wind blows away.
The opening with heliotrope and orange blossom hints at the unusual combination of thyme and cumin, dusted with iris.
Very strong in longevity and projection, you should apply this fragrance sparingly to enjoy its true soul.
And when after hours the warm, soft base of cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, and incense reveals itself, no evil demon stands a chance of surviving. So ""heavenly"" is the slightly smoky-vanilla-spicy scent accord that you feel safe and secure.
""Gucci Eau de Parfum"" is a composition of aromas that is so unique that it resembles no other perfume I know.
That the scent is ""heavy"" is true. But sweet? Not at all!! Nor is it ""cloying."" Certainly not ""dirty.""
Rather, it is simply enveloping, good-natured, and unusual.
By the way: Not just for ladies."
Gucci Eau de Parfum,01/16/2015,Wasserblume,F,6,,16,I confess...,"...that I was a blind purchase.
...but the best one ever made by my owner.

And here is our story of getting to know each other:

I lay bored in a box filled to the brim with other contenders.
There were flowers, waters, heavyweights, and all were just waiting to be taken home.
And then I saw her, my new mistress, who would free me from this uniformity, who would grant me freedom and let me be known. For that, I will reward her accordingly. I promised. And then, as if she could hear me, she reached into the box and had eyes only for me. The others were not even given a glance.

I am the chosen one, and so it was. We went home together, and I rewarded her curiosity.
With wide eyes, she undressed me and revealed my dark brown soul. She trusted me right from the start.
I could tell because she, without hesitation, introduced me to her nearly most intimate places...
And I recognized from her moans that she liked me, no, that she had been captivated by me from the very beginning.

I enveloped her like a balm with my elegant tendrils in the form of orange blossom and iris.
I also showed her my distinctive and spicy side, which would protect her like a man. Here, my spices like thyme and cumin helped, which she already knows from the kitchen and enjoys using.
With my musk accord and cedarwood, I ensured that she would stretch and snuggle against me. I seduced her.
Since then, she has guarded me like a precious treasure, as I am the last of my kind.
But I will give her everything until the last drop!"
Gucci Eau de Parfum,05/06/2022,Iris2022,F,15,,16,Gucci's Highlight,"Why this fragrance has been discontinued and is now very rarely available or completely out of stock is a mystery to me. Fortunately, I still have a few remaining bottles, and until three years ago, you could still get original packaged 30ml flacons from the States for about U$ 60, which I treasure like a gem.
Gucci classic is sensual and very balanced; there is no cloying sweetness, neither caraway nor leather, musk or sandalwood spoil the feminine character; it is not intrusive without being shy and certainly not discreet. You enter the room, and everyone, regardless of gender or age, joyfully and admiringly sniffs in my direction. I hardly perceive orange blossoms; iris, heliotrope, vanilla, and incense can be sensed, but the interplay of all the ingredients is as perfect as in a star orchestra: no one stands out, is unpleasantly noticeable, and together they form an ideal conglomerate.
In our best perfumery in Vienna, I wanted to find a twin, together with three super noses who really made an effort. They agreed on Lalique Le Parfum, which might seem similar at first, but after just 5 minutes, it fails miserably. What a pity, such a pity."
Gucci Eau de Parfum,08/07/2010,Hermessenz,F,246,,0,Insider Tip,"Last night I was a bit bored and rummaged through my perfume cabinet.
By chance, I stumbled upon this gem. Since I really couldn't remember how this treasure smelled, I quickly sprayed a bit on my wrist. And? What can I say? I immediately took it back to the bathroom because something this fine should never languish in the back corner.
Okay, the opening is a bit strange; you don't quite know where the scent journey is headed, but the base is simply stunning. Not because it hits you hard in the nose, but because this fragrance radiates warmth, elegance, and softness.
The leather note is perfectly balanced and develops a certain ""rrrrr"" effect with vanilla and incense-if you know what I mean. ;)
Buy it, folks!"
Gucci Eau de Parfum,02/14/2012,Holly61,F,0,,11,A Blanket That Wraps Me Up,"This fragrance has something mystical about it.

The top note is quite intense. It opens up fruity-spicy, with a slight ""bubblegum"" aroma teasing my olfactory senses.

In the heart note, the fragrance throws around spice bombs, and you can't shield yourself from it... Dry iris flees from cumin and thyme, heavily breathing and fascinated by such boldness, I must engage in this game... I must go through...

Once I have mastered this hurdle of olfactory bombardment, I am rewarded with a gradually emerging creaminess, spicy-leathery, just like a velvety brown blanket that offers me its cozy warmth and security.

My skin chemistry masterfully presents this fragrance to me, leather notes and slightly nutty accords appear. Frankincense ensures that Gucci 1 doesn't become too smooth and soft in the dry down, it brings this mystical ""touch"".

Candles, incense, and chill Oriental lounge sounds --- outside a winter night at icy minus 15 degrees and inside cozy warmth for two... this fragrance fits perfectly..."

This scent makes me feel sick, especially the thyme, which is quite prominent here! But I will still give it a try.
What I find positive about Gucci is that the entire fragrance bouquet has a certain recognizability, a rather special note!
I have to admit that, even though I can't stand it....
I will try to describe it as objectively as possible;)

The perfume is rather fresh for a few seconds after application, then the clove, very intensely fragrant thyme, and also caraway become noticeable.
In the base note, the scent of thyme and clove is still quite present, quickly merging here with some incense, a hint of vanilla, a bit of leather, and cedar. This perfume overwhelms my stomach, sorry!"
Guilty Intense,08/20/2024,Czarcasm,F,77,,1,Everything I was looking for...,"...to get through the cold months. Gucci Guilty Intense is a love for me! I don't do signature scents because I don't want to limit myself but this one comes very close! Light sweetness in a bottle with some nicely blended flowers and some pepper and patchouli in the background.

Yes, this is a floral scent, but it's not what I'd usually expect from a floral perfume. I've been a little apprehensive of florals, mostly because a lot of them contain heavy white flowers or a rose note that dominates everything. No, this is definitely not your stereotypical flower powerhouse. Nor is it heavy or suffocating. The geranium and lilac work really well together and don't take center stage.

Guitly Intense is rather fresh and 'sparkly' smelling, almost like a glass of champagne with some fruit added. I also get a whiff of honey whenever I put this on, even though it's not listed as a note. Delicious!
I don't find it especially sexy (I've owned sexier scents!), I just wear it because I like it. It's appropriate for leisure or daily wear during winter as well! Don't turn this beauty down simply because it used to be a popular clubbing perfume!

I've received a couple of compliments when wearing this, mostly from my friends whenever I hug them. Like I said earlier, this is no powerhouse with beast sillage and presence. It's a bit light and I usually spray around 5 times so that other people can smell it on me as well. Longevity could be better, however the real problem with this scent is that it becomes a skin scent rather quickly. After about 4 to 5 hours it just becomes a skin scent that you can barely pick up anymore. It lasts longer on clothes so I just spray some on my scarf. I will probably have to repurchase this one when I run out."
Guilty Intense,08/18/2024,Missk,F,1357,,1,Smothering Lilac and Heliotrope,"I don't know whether an intense version of this fragrance was entirely necessary. To be fair, the original Guilty was fairly short-lived, and while Guilty Intense is an improvement in terms of projection and longevity, it leaves much to be desired.

Gucci Guilty Intense is a pleasant fragrance, easy to wear and a sure crowd-pleaser. It shows a somewhat interesting contrast between peppery florals and earthy patchouli.

Since this fragrance has been 'amped up' to an EDP, what was considered pleasant in the original fragrance, now smells sharp and at times, a little screechy. The pink pepper accord is unfortunately overwhelmingly strong on my skin, smothering the feminine lilac and heliotrope blend.

I personally like to wear scents that make me stand out from the crowd and feel exceptional. Once again, (similar to my reaction to the original Guilty), this flanker comes across as bland and overrated. The high price tag leads you to expect so much more.

Gucci Guilty Intense is much warmer and more elegant than its predecessor, making it a good choice for Autumn and Winter. Fans of the original fragrance that had issues with its lasting strength, will most likely enjoy this intense EDP flanker.

Guilty Intense,05/18/2015,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,14,the black sheep,"After Guilty had hopped towards me, charming and lively like a little lamb, and had fortunately rendered the title ""Guilty"" absurd, I positively approached trying Guilty Intense.

Although the Intense appears fuller and darker, I cannot assign any ""guilt"" to it either.
This fragrance is also soft and seductively cuddly - and in no way wicked or even offensive.
It may be the black sheep in the herd, but it is also tame and cozy.

The pepper is mild-spicy and the lilac enchanting, yet unobtrusive.
Amber adds a gentle glow to the fragrance, and patchouli is responsible for the dark fleece of the sheep.

A scent that, although a favorite, stands out from the crowd.

I don't know which marketing genius named this incredibly attractive fragrance ""Guilty,"" because the wearer really shouldn't feel guilty at all.

On the contrary - my fellow humans find the scent very warm and inviting - just like I do."

There was no talk of more expensive perfumes or brands like Gucci. At that time, my mother bought Gucci Guilty for herself. I then tested the perfume... and oh my God!!! It was as if I could literally smell gold. I immediately fell in love with this scent and claimed it for myself. Guilty became my first real perfume. After that, I was done with stuffy floral-sweet drugstore perfumes ^^^^

I associate the scent with cool, clear starry nights in late summer-autumn when you go out and are dressed more elegantly. Actually, Guilty is wearable in any season and even during the day.
How does one feel when wearing the scent?
Not like an ordinary woman out of the ordinary; but also not like a little princess in the spotlight - rather like a true Queen. A Queen who is very low-key (as the scent is perceived more subconsciously and intimately),
more calm and reserved with her elegant demeanor (due to the weak H+S) and has a mischievous smile with a seductive, almost enchanting aura.

Gucci Guilty is simply a fragrance that radiates a ""golden"" charm. Without vanilla, without spice, without gourmand, without stuffy sweet something. Identifying and describing the scent notes themselves is relatively difficult; I would vaguely estimate floral-synthetic-soapy-dry-woody. The delicate floral lilac note proves the ""Guilty"" rather the opposite. So as seductive and guilty as the low-key Queen may initially seem, she is also quite innocent :)
The only flaw of the perfume is its longevity + sillage.

Guilty was my first love in the world of perfume, everyone liked it when I wore it, as it is not a scent that one (at least on others) can dislike, and it remains my all-time favorite."
Guilty Intense,06/23/2014,Available7,F,8,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Glamour my life!,"I am a big fan of Gucci Guilty Intense! It is indeed a heavy fragrance, which is actually more suited for the cooler seasons, but still perfect for summer party nights. A seductive, short dress, long flowing hair, high heels, smoky eyes, sex appeal... and then the erotic scent of Gucci Guilty Intense... This could almost turn into a fairy tale... In fact, I find the TV..."
Guilty Intense,10/17/2011,KarateArwen,F,14,,11,Heliotrope Violet Cloud,"Today I received this beautiful fragrance. My first thought was, here I have a wonderful heliotrope scent, paired with lilac. The lilac is dominant here. I have never sniffed such a fine lilac scent before. Ideal for lilac lovers, very elegant and delicate yet still sexy (in my opinion). I don't really perceive the mandarin and pink pepper on the first sniff at all. The..."
Guilty Intense,02/21/2012,Carnolie,F,41,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,nomen non est omen,"This EdP is neither ""guilty"" nor ""intense."" But really good. Classically good. The top note of (clearly recognizable) mandarin and pink pepper (however that smells) is beyond any initial suspicion. Lilac, heliotrope, and violet (heliotrope clearly dominates) are certainly no angels, but must be acquitted due to lack of evidence. Regarding the suspects amber and patchouli, the investigation was closed due to lack of particular public interest.

So in short: if you just want to smell pleasant, without sticking your neck out too far or smelling cheap, and also don’t want to be tied to a specific occasion, then you’ve come to the right place. I can't think of much more. The scent is coherent without edges and corners - but in a very engaging way. Perhaps a tiny bit uninteresting - but not really meaningless. It radiates warmth - I would associate it with the color orange. Definitely a more youthful scent, so not necessarily for the distinguished lady over 50.

One drawback: the longevity leaves much to be desired for an EdP that also claims the addition ""intense."""
Guilty Intense,10/18/2011,Guerlinde,F,0,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,0,"the violet is guilty!! Intense? Yes, very guilty..","Given the name Guilty and the design of the gaudy bottle, I would have spontaneously associated it with a very intrusive, provocative scent, but as so often in life, one must admit that one is on the wrong track with stereotypical thinking and prejudices.. because Guilty opens as a delicate, sensual, velvety delight.. why delight, you ask? I immediately have an association.. I feel my saliva increasing and I have an uncontrollable craving for finely whipped, unsweetened cream..
I suspect that the combination of lilac and patchouli is responsible for my cream dreams..
Mandarin and pepper are not perceivable from the start, and after just a few minutes, a very persistent violet makes itself known.. hmmm, while this is not bad, it is definitely the reason why it cannot become my scent..
The longevity of the fragrance is very good, so anyone deciding to purchase should not be stingy and prefer the EdP over the Edt.. (there's only a 2€ difference)

My conclusion: if one had forgotten the violet in the top note, then... oh, I don’t even know what then:-)"
Guilty Intense,10/19/2022,Mojo2000,F,8,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Guilty?,"I have a kind of love-hate relationship with some Gucci fragrances. Starting with Rush, which I have owned three times and still don't know if I like it or not.
Gucci Première was already a bit further up on my scale, a beautiful but unfortunately rare classic.
Where was I? Oh yes, Guilty. The bottle is an absolute no-go that initially kept me from testing it. Then I made a quick stop at my trusted perfumery and snagged a sample of it. Since then, it has been gathering dust in my treasure chest.
And then, on a whim, I cautiously dabbed it on, with zero expectations.

Sniff...sniff - ah - sniff.... - mmmhh - sniff not so bad at all.

In fact, I associate this scent with a large beige cashmere scarf that is beautifully warm or an elegant brown-golden cognac. The fragrance is warm, wonderfully laid-back, and very classic.
As a signature scent, I think it would be quite suitable. The fruits stay in the background, but the pepper is present, and the patchouli is very subtle.

Okay, now I have finally made myself guilty by waiting so long to test it, and I actually need more of it now...."
Guilty Intense,10/19/2023,Fibianna,F,9,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Expectation not met... But still beautiful,"To be honest, I expected something different from the name. Especially with ""intense,"" I thought there would be power behind it. The scent is still beautiful. You get a lightly powdered lilac, accompanied by a bit of fruit. The patchouli grounds it with a hint of green. The fragrance has a pleasant sweetness and is an elegant and well-groomed scent. It can be worn in any season and for any occasion. Unfortunately, the longevity and sillage are only mediocre."
Gucci by Gucci,04/06/2019,JSpines,M,177,,5,Gucci by Gucci,"Back in the day, I used to ""blind buy"" fragrances all the time. Many a time, I was left unimpressed and disappointed in the purchase. I believe it was due to my impulsiveness and inexperience. When I was just learning about fragrances, I wasn't sure what all the notes smelled like from the description so I was more willing to throw caution to the wind when making a purchase. Fast forward 10 years. I know what I like and what I don't like now. I know what notes I'm drawn to and which ones I'm not. I now have an instinct that is much more hoaned, when making a blind buy. I am happy to report that I am very rarely let down from blind buy purchases I make nowadays.
Working in a store that carries fragrances is both exciting and daunting. So many fragrances to research! Haha
I take my time and I look at every one and then I google the ones that I am most interested in to read about the notes, the prices, the availability and finally, the reviews. I take all of that information into account before I jump at a blind buy now.
When the feeling of confidence kicks in, I go for it! Or, if I'm feeling really unsure, I take a pass. Sometimes I'll research a scent for hours before making my mind up but in the end, all the digging around is worth it.
I finished work on Thursday and decided to take a look at the fragrance section before leaving for home. (Believe it or not, I do not do this every day! Haha)
I knew that we had just received a large shipment in of fragrance in that day and was eager to see what we had. I picked up two for men (Versace Oud Noir and Gucci Made to Measure) and three for woman (Gucci by Gucci, Versace Vanitas and Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue.)
I stood there with my phone and looked up all of them. No to the Oud, too manly. No to Made to Measure, too boring. No to Vanitas, too similar to Chloe, which I despise. No to Light Blue, has been reformulated and is now screechy.
Hmmmmm.........Gucci by Gucci. Ding, ding, ding..........we have a winner!!!
59.99 for a 50 ml. bottle plus my employee discount, not bad!
Unboxed it when I arrived home and smelled the nozzle. I knew instantly that I was going to love it. I wore it the following day and had that huge sigh of relief, knowing that I had made the right decision.
When I first sprayed it on (I always do 2 or 3 sprays on my chest/tummy area) I noticed a ""stinky"" note but it didn't scare me, I knew it would settle down and it did. I'm hit or miss with patchouli but it's smooth in here. The musk is light and also smooth. The honey brings a sweetness but it's also smooth and gentle. Overall, it's smooth and well blended and to me, it's a confident, sexy, ""power"" scent. It's not in-your-face or aggressive. It sneaks up on you, gives you a warm hug and steals a kiss! Alluring!
I've read other reviews stating that they wished it was spicier but I think we have enough spicy scents out there already. I think that this one is perfect just as it is. Absolutely stunning for cooler seasons.
Lasts all day on me and I continually get wiffs of it whenever I heat up and am moving around.
The bottle itself is also drop-dead gorgeous!
It's sad that it's been discontinued but I'll certainly enjoy it to the very last drop!"
Gucci by Gucci,11/01/2013,Happygeisha,F,34,,6,like a honey dusted kiss,"i smell patchouli and honey, equally.

oh yeah and its a darkly light scent, it really is! i know that doesn't make much sense but its winter-y and spicy but only a whisper on my skin. even when i first spray it, it fades to a beautiful sweet honey dusted kiss. a light, sheer, warm hug. in fact, its so light that i had to re-spritz before i left work. 3 hours later and its still wafting gently to my nostrils, hahahaa. (sorry that sentence sounded ridiculous and made me laugh.)"
Gucci by Gucci,02/16/2022,Anamandy,F,107,,2,A Woody Floral with No Wood,"I don't understand the patchouli note in this scent. I don't smell it – at least not in the traditional hippy way. Nor am I getting it in an earthy way, as is in Prada Amber. Nor is it green. What I am getting is a gorgeous, satiny wood. I am really amazed by that considering there is no wood listed in the notes for this fragrance. If I were to visualize this fragrance it would be glossy, like a sleek, smooth, polished piece of ebony wood. The fact that this has no wood sent me on a search to find out more about the Patchouli plant itself. I was able to find out that there are several varieties that are shrubby, and the sap is often extracted from their woody stems and put to various uses. The most widely used this way is Java Patchouli, which is prized for its sleek wood notes. If this is the type of patchouli used here that could explain the beautiful wood notes I'm smelling.

When taken as a whole, this composition is very rich. The fruit, honey and spice notes are very light, seemingly only there to accentuate the beautiful patchouli. I'm not getting Tiare outright but there is a creamy, buttery richness to this composition that could only be attributed to that. But make no mistake, Patchouli is the star here and in its present form is extremely seductive, sexy, and glamorous.

I'm still finding it hard to believe that a note I normally dislike so much can be so beautiful; but from first spray to the silky end this was a head over heels love for me. I am so sad this gorgeous scent was discontinued. I am actually baffled by that."

Gucci by Gucci,01/18/2012,Missk,F,1357,,0,Woodsy Pear,"This perfume isn't as bad as people make out, however it is slightly boring and unoriginal.

I expected this fragrance to be intense, warm and truly seductive, however what I get is a light, musky, almost masculine scent. Not bad, it is definitely wearable, but not as outstanding as I would've liked it to be.

There are slight hints of woodsy notes throughout this fragrance, yet there are no woods listed in this scent. The guava and pear notes confuse me greatly as I cannot smell them at all. Gucci opens with floral notes and stays like that until the scent fades away.

Another disappointing aspect to this scent is its lack of lasting power, which surprised me seeing that you pay a considerable amount to own this fragrance. In my opinion you aren't getting what you paid for.

I can't help feeling like there's something missing in this fragrance. It definitely lacks character and appeal for me."

At that time I loved fruity florals and especially those with a citric vibe such as Armani Diamonds.

So I preferred something else xd Today, thankfully, I don't see..."
Gucci by Gucci,09/16/2011,Baeumchen,F,160,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,12,Chyprepferd,"The bottle already caught my attention: beautiful shape and warm, noble colors.

The bottle incorporates the design elements from the past of the Gucci house:
In the center is the Horsebit. In the 1950s, it adorned handbags made of heavy brown leather, which was quilted similarly to a saddle.
The idea for the web stripe comes from the stable. The saddle is secured with the stripe of linen fabric on the horse's back. The lettering is based on the original signature of Guccio Gucci and is stitched into leather products.

The first fragrance creation by Frida Giannini is a modern chypre scent that I really like. It is quite soft and warm, sensual and elegant, like the coat of a horse.

I can easily detect a slight fruitiness that gives the fragrance its modernity. For me, this scent is consistently sensual, warm, and softly composed. A light sweetness (from the honey) is also noticeable.
For me, it is a noble fragrance that is not too overpowering and lasts for many hours!"
Gucci by Gucci,06/09/2013,Katniss,F,127,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,"Exotic Tiaré Honey, should I wear it out?","When a label suddenly decides to discontinue a fragrance, I can accept it if better scents come into production. Gucci by Gucci could not replace my dearly loved Gucci Eau de Parfum I. However, it is still a very delicious, fruity scent. At first, I wasn't quite sure if the slightly biting honey-tiare-musk combination was really bearable, but ultimately, it is exactly what makes this perfume unique and exceptional. The explosion of guavas and pears upon spraying is really wonderful and very fruity. At the same time, I smell the Tiaré flower and musk, which run through the entire scent progression. The honey is noticeable but not dominant. I perceive the patchouli at most as a base carrier, but also not prominent. It is a very nice fragrance, perhaps a bit of an acquired taste, because the Tiaré has a special scent that one must like and which does not play a major role in the perfume industry, but that is what makes this perfume extraordinary and special. As a going-out scent? For me, it is more suited for a professional workday; for going out, it is neither elegant nor sexy enough. In my opinion, it does not have the erotic and aphrodisiac touch. But as I said, I like it very much...and the bottle is also fitting."
Gucci by Gucci,03/21/2016,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,10,also for young ladies,"My mom has claimed the Guccis for herself - rightly so, as they suit her excellently.

I gladly take note of her elegant scent trail - but I always kept a respectful distance from fragrances like Premier, as they seemed too ladylike for me.

Even when I am beautifully washed and combed, I am nowhere near as naturally ladylike as my mother.

But a spray of her Gucci by Gucci, which she encouraged me to try, surprisingly clings to me like a second skin.

Who would have thought - for this scent is exquisite and elegant as well.

Its softness and flexibility make it quite wearable for me.
It still exudes an alluring preciousness that surprisingly fits with my casual outfit.

Pear and guava are smoothly fruity, and the Tiare is elegantly floral.
The honey note reminds me of French nougat, which melts sweetly in the nose.
The patchouli is soft and warm.

Gucci conveys closeness and security - it is elegant, but in no way distant.
For a cuddle cat like me, it is very fitting.

I thank my mom for the good advice and for always sharing everything with me."
Gucci by Gucci,06/28/2016,Minigolf,F,2512,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Sweet Fruits featuring Honey-like Something,"I don't want to tear apart a scent in the air, but for my nose, it is definitely not suitable, and my dislike is my personal opinion. ""Gucci by Gucci"" definitely starts off fruity-sweet, almost overpowering for me. This remains the case for quite a while until a kind of citrusy and slightly green-bitter note takes over. This is paired with a honey note (similar to English Honey Drops). Later, scents of patchouli and musk can be detected, which are very active and pleasant to sniff, but these fragrance components are constantly ""overflown"" by this fruit and honey note, making ""Gucci by Gucci"" personally just too sweet and too heavy for me. Dear Gucci friends, please don't be mad at me, as I am just a lover of chypre and spicy orientals."
Gucci by Gucci,10/31/2010,Kalix,F,87,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,"Fortunately, a Maverick Again","What I like about Gucci is that the fragrances I own are beautifully quirky and unconventional! However, since Flora, I have become a bit more cautious, as it is not my scent.

Gucci by GUCCI EDP is the idea of dusting off the Chypre fragrance category and creating a renewed interest in this scent direction today. I find the basic cleaning successful, at least for me. I have smelled classics in this category and found myself too weak for them. They were, of course, interesting and an experience in connection with their history, but not wearable for me. All critics of the fragrance will find thousands of reasons why Gucci by GUCCI is not a successful retro Chypre or does not deserve the name Chypre. However, I am a lover of this scent and can only report good things.

Gucci by GUCCI is more precisely described as chypre-fruity, but it would be an outrageous cheekiness (this phrase comes from Cinderella in the film ""Three Hazelnuts for Cinderella,"" I don't know why it just came to mind??? Well, 3HFA fans recognized???) to make a comparison to Mitsouko by Guerlain, so I won't do it, couldn't do it, and somehow I have done it anyway, but Mitsouko is also classified in this subcategory of Chypres.

Gucci by GUCCI EDP is my fragrance; rarely does a scent from this family capture my heart, but this one has succeeded. Fruity in the top note and already in the first whiffs unusual. A tart fruitiness, zesty and very, very fleeting, which is a shame because this top note is brilliant. The heart with Tiaré, and I already sense patchouli here, is complex and holds up very well into the base. An extremely successful move is to add a honey note to this floral heart, this wonderful Tiaré, and the marvelous patchouli, perfect and not sweet! Even though the honey does not flow forever, which is not necessarily a disadvantage, a wonderful base remains, and the typical scent character of Gucci by GUCCI, while weaker, remains soft.

The bottle is definitely successful, as elegant and unobtrusive as the scent itself. Gucci has packaged a retro idea in a great commercial, and I have once again dug out Blondie with the incomparable Debbie Harry and can almost see the Gucci girls dancing to Heart of Glass."
Gucci by Gucci,04/26/2012,Nathalen,F,13,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,The Individual Elegant Lady,"A lot has already been said about the scent of this perfume, but due to the rather different perceptions, I would like to share my opinion as well.

In my opinion, the scent is intended for an elegant, self-confident lady and is suitable for both evening wear and business life. It pairs well with a classic appearance in a suit or pantsuit.

For me, it starts with a very fruity, but not sweet presence, but soon becomes warm, elegant, slightly bitter, yet subtly a bit sweet, creating a discreet but well-perceived feminine overall impression.

Gucci seems to develop very individually on the skin and is perceived differently by those around, but generally never negatively or unpleasantly. In my opinion, it does not have a very high recognition factor. But isn’t it actually nicer if not everyone, especially in the professional world, immediately knows which fragrance you are wearing and you are not pigeonholed with associations?
A good perfume should give the wearer a personal touch, and Gucci by Gucci fulfills this requirement.

The longevity of the scent for me (EDP) is medium to good. However, I no longer perceive the scent throughout the entire day. If I spray it in the morning, I feel the need to reapply in the afternoon. The heavy, bulky bottle is anything but suitable for handbags, so it’s better to decant a little or refrain from reapplying altogether.

On the vanity, the bottle looks very nice, and I personally like its appearance, but this is probably more a matter of taste than with many other perfume bottles. It certainly appeals more to the classic, mature woman than to the young romantic girl, but that is intended here and fits the content.

I also find the brown tint of the bottle positive, so you can leave it out without having to hide it in a cupboard or box to protect the scent from light. Nevertheless, the bottle is translucent, and you can see how much is left. My bottle is now running low, and as a critique, I doubt whether the bottle can be completely emptied due to the wide, flat base, and the spray tube is positioned in the center, making tilting ineffective.

It remains a surprise how often I can still use the scent, as I will not be repurchasing it despite my overall positive impression - at least for now - because the competition in fragrances is simply too great.

As I read the other comments and incorporate my own opinion, I think that despite the name, the scent will have a hard time being accepted into the league of great classics in the long term, but it is definitely worth testing it extensively."
Gucci by Gucci,02/07/2015,Entchen,F,12,,4,"Narciso Rodriguez For Her (Eau de Parfum), is it you?","In a sniffing mood, I reached for Gucci by GUCCI. An acquaintance of mine wore it, and I thought it was really great.
From memory, I expected this very scent and found something different:
Narciso Rodriguez For Her (Eau de Parfum)!
I looked again at my hand to see if I was actually holding the right bottle. Yes, it was GbG.

The first three hours, the two are quite similar. NRFH is a bit spicier and less floral-sweet, but the similarity still caused confusion.
After three or four hours, it takes a different direction. Strangely, I can now smell the pear that is supposed to be in the top note. Patchouli and honey make GbG sweeter and more pleasant than NRFH. Pleasant, as I quickly get a headache from the scent twin.
It is bitter, but the floral and fruity notes make it feminine and elegant.
Some time later, it becomes increasingly powdery, less fruity, and even a bit smoky. Here, the patchouli note slightly reminds me of Dark Amber & Ginger Lily by Jo Malone.

Now I really like it, and my memory of the woman comes back - But do I want to wait five hours every time for the scent to develop the way I like it?

The longevity and sillage are okay. However, one should not spray it too generously, as one can be overwhelmed by the oriental spiciness.
GbG is best suited for autumn and winter evenings, but can also be worn during the day with just one spray.

In my opinion, it is a sensual scent for women who like it spicy, bitter, and feminine.

I will not buy it, as I don’t want to wait that long for the base. But I’m happy to recommend it.

Addendum: 08.02.2015 23:39
Even after about 17 hours, I could still perceive a slight hint. Super longevity!"
Gucci by Gucci,10/30/2010,Woelfin,F,243,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,"At first ""yuck!"", but then ...","... ""wow!""
One should give the scent a moment to settle.

After the first spray, I immediately thought: ""Oh man, this smells cheap!"" Not ""tacky-cheap,"" which might have been somewhat nice, but ""drugstore scent-cheap."" A mishmash of whatever, a bit overpowering, indefinable, simply not good. Especially for this price. A no-go!

If you give the perfume a little time, it changes relatively quickly and turns very positive. The scent won't reinvent the wheel, but it becomes an interesting perfume that can adapt to any situation (with the right wearer, which I'll get to).

Regarding the scent notes:

Not fruity.
Not sweet (that's how I perceive it, even if others smell it differently).
Not delicate.

For me, ""Gucci by Gucci"" is a scent with edges and corners. Not a girly scent for teenagers. The fragrance is very mature, and for me, it's of the somewhat rougher kind. The scent seems a bit uneven to me. It's a little ""fidgety"" and might come across as extremely overpowering to some, especially at first. That is, until you can really clearly sense the base note. Then it starts to show, for the very first time, a bit of its softer side. But that's really just the faint trace of the scent that remains on the skin at the end.

You really need to pay attention to where you wear it.

By the way, this is the Midnight Poison phenomenon. It also seems extremely intrusive to me. Until the base comes to the forefront. That can be pleasant if you like it - then it can also be pleasant from the start - but otherwise, it should really be approached with caution.

For me, Gucci by Gucci is not an all-rounder. I'm not the right person for that, simply because of the initial strong presence of the scent. But in the evening, when it's cold or when going out... those would be the Gucci moments. People who really like this perfume - more than I do - and stand by it, will find that the scent suits them in EVERY situation.

Unfortunately, I have to say that the price-performance ratio here won't be to everyone's taste. The scent is really not that ""special.""

P.S.: I find the bottle very pretty."
Gucci by Gucci,01/23/2012,Kontext,F,25,,7,Round Thing,"As angular as the bottle, so profound is the inner essence. Warm, feminine, cultivated, subtly erotic, but never pretentious or vulgar. All the notes blend harmoniously for me, without being boring on one hand or jagged on the other. The scent is, for me, the liquefied embodiment of elegance and style with a twist, of serious, practiced calm, upright understatement with an incredibly feminine glow beneath it, which the wearer knows how to handle and lets loose in selected moments. No squeaky citrus, no sticky peach, no sweet fruit sorbet that would disturb this tasteful nobility. The pear nestles with a flutter of the eyelashes against the warm honey and gently leads to the velvety musk-patchouli finish.

Fantastic. I consider the scent to be grandly underrated and suitable for both daytime and evening wear.

If only the bottle were a little less ostentatious - we really don’t need that."
Gucci by Gucci,04/23/2010,Antoine,F,207,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,0,Exciting!,"I find the bottle completely unappealing. Strained to look elegant, and what’s with this silly, jingling stirrup in plastic gold? Because I found Rush by Gucci quite impressive, I decided to try Gucci by Gucci despite the silly bottle, and the scent pleasantly surprised me. The top note briefly raises fears of the currently popular fruity-floral-sweet mush. But then it develops a nice balance of fruity, subtly sweet, and bitter notes. An interesting tension. Overall, it has an oriental feel, but is hardly floral, not spicy, and only slightly sweet. I could get used to that and would even tolerate the bottle. However, it’s more suited for the cold season."
Gucci by Gucci,10/17/2013,NadsSpatz,F,596,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Classic Elegance,"~ Inspiration ~
So far, I have had quite good experiences with Gucci fragrances and wanted to test this one after Guilty and Flora.

~ Bottle ~
Classic and elegant.
The warm brown tones look luxurious, especially together with the golden cap. A small golden stirrup serves as an eye-catcher on the closure. Overall, it evokes an association for me with brown, stately horses, their wealthy owners, and the accompanying equestrian tournaments.

~ Scent ~
It starts fruity-herb with pear and guava.
This top note gradually fades and reveals the harmonious heart note of white Tiare flower and light lily of the valley. The whole is rounded off by a combination of honey, musk, and patchouli. A warm, sensually feminine scent develops that is not too sweet but rather floral-woody.

~ Longevity ~
I can perceive it on my skin for about 4-5 hours (on clothing and hair even longer). However, a sparing application is advisable, as it can otherwise become too biting and intrusive.

~ Occasion ~
It suits stylish, self-confident women who know what they want best.
I see it as an evening fragrance and for special occasions in the colder season; I can also imagine it well on successful businesswomen.

~ Conclusion ~
Actually, I am not very fond of herb-woody perfumes, but I find this one quite pleasant to wear due to its blend with slightly sweet floral accords."

Gucci by Gucci,09/18/2010,Miro,F,57,,2,Allrounder,"Gucci by Gucci is a good all-rounder for me.

I always use it when I'm not quite sure which perfume I'm in the mood for today.

At first, it’s quite fruity due to the pear, sweet, but not overly sweet. Overall, this scent is not intrusive and stays quite close to the body for me.
In the end, honey/patchouli lingers very softly on the skin.

It lasts about 4-5 hours on me, which I find quite short.
I won't be repurchasing it also for that reason, but also because it’s just an all-rounder for me. It can be replaced by one of the many other scents that are out there.

Thanks to this site, I have at least 50 other fragrances in mind!"

Rush 2,05/10/2012,Sherapop,F,1240,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,~(GUCCI RUSH),"GUCCI RUSH 2 is nearly the strict antithesis of GUCCI RUSH. RUSH 2 is cool, slightly soapy, lightly floral, not at all sweet, and rather shortlived in the edt.

The somewhat dark, lingering oriental thickness of RUSH (imparted by mingling patchouli and vanilla) is not present in RUSH 2 at all. Rather, RUSH 2 is a tiny bunch of little white flowers on a cool morning with dew still clinging to kelly green blades of grass.

It's almost as though the Gucci people self-consciously sought to produce a fragrance which would appeal to all those who disliked RUSH. A better name for RUSH 2 might be:

~(GUCCI RUSH)!"
Rush 2,01/26/2012,Missk,F,1357,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,A soapier and much more pleasant flanker of Rush,"Rush 2 is hardly related to Rush at all. This is an entirely different composition altogether.

Upon first application, I could barely smell it. The opening notes are extremely subtle and intimate. I would describe the rose, freesia and lily of the valley as having a soapy and fresh-like quality.

With the emergence of the heart, Rush 2 develops character. The scent strengthens considerably and shows elements of originality. The soapiness is still present, however I detect a subtle greeness, like a tropical, damp garden smell.

Rush 2 concludes with a simplistic black currant and musk blend, with this being the only fruity kick you will experience during the development of Rush 2, right at the very end.

I vividly remember a man that owned a perfume store where I used to live, raving on about Rush 2. He had me try it several times but I had to go back to this fragrance 3 years on because the scent hadn't stuck in my memory. Because of that I don't think this fragrance is very memorable, certainly not signature material in my humble opinion."
Rush 2,06/16/2023,Stacia,F,134,,3,A tale of two sisters...,"I used to be part of the crowd who thought Rush 2 bore no resemblance whatsoever to the original Gucci Rush. But now that I have worn both within a few days of each other, I have changed my mind. They ARE sisters! First of all, they have the same father, Michel Almairac. They were born a mere two years apart from each other and therefore part of the same ""perfume trend generation"". Like sisters who are close to one another, they are able to play together and layer well with each other. While original Gucci Rush is the louder, bossier, dominant older sister, Rush 2 tries to emulate her in certain ways.

In Rush 2, the fruity aspect of Rush's peach is replaced by a sweet juicy black currant note. The original had a strong gardenia note, while Rush 2 has gardenia but it rests shyly in the background, preferring to let cleaner flowers like freesia and lily of the valley do the talking. The original is the bad ass of the clan, sneaking out late to party while Rush 2 stays home and studies but lets the original sneak back in through her window because after all, they are close and she likes to live vicariously through the stories Rush brings home. Rush 2 is the daughter grandma likes better but original Rush is the one who will go on to be famous."
Rush 2,06/01/2022,Kleopatra,F,229,,22,An Adult Fruity-Floral,"I emptied at least two bottles of this fragrance in my younger years. A scent I always liked, but then somehow lost sight of-or rather, lost track of.

When I read that this fragrance was no longer being produced, the familiar hoarding instinct kicked in, and I quickly purchased another bottle. The word ""discontinued"" always triggers strange behaviors in me... Now, many fragrances that I liked very much back then no longer seem to suit me today. But I thought, at least I have Rush 2 for nostalgic sniffing.

However, the first spray surprised me: I still really like the scent! It is still absolutely wearable today. Fresh, floral, a bit fruity, without the otherwise indispensable sweetness that is so common today, yet not bitter, no scratching, stinging, or biting-just nice, fresh, feminine, compatible with others, and very pleasant to wear.

And they are discontinuing this? WHY? Gucci Rush 2 (which, by the way, has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Rush!) is not a scent that will take your breath away or one that you will never forget, but as I said, it is office-appropriate and will make a pleasant impression. Or you might not stand out at all, depending on the situation. Very few will feel disturbed by this fragrance; many will find this adult fruity-floral pleasantly appealing.

The only downside: The bottle (is that supposed to represent a cassette case? Who even remembers cassettes??). I remember that you could only get the rest of the fragrance out by digging the corners of this plastic thing deep into your palms. But that won't stop me from wearing this lovely scent until it's empty."
Rush 2,09/18/2016,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,15,Square Blackberries?,"After I had forgiven Rush for its ""boxy appearance,"" I boldly reached for Rush 2.

This scent greets me more lovingly than the original version.

Rush 2 has, unlike its bottle, no corners or edges - instead, it welcomes me gently and friendly.
Even the blackberries are not square, but full and round - and roll towards me pleasantly aromatic.
Freesia and Narcissus spread floral brightness, with a hint of soft rose.
The palm wood is also cuddly - and the lily leans towards elegance.

An attractively floral-fruity daytime scent that, contrary to its name, knows no rush.
Rather a fragrance to lean back - and relax.

Indeed - haste makes waste."

Rush 2,06/26/2016,Lillet,F,0,,13,Pink Plastic,"The scent of Gucci Rush 2 is unmistakable, super sweet fruity and yet has a touch of freshness somewhere.
If anyone is wondering where I get the freshness from, well, it simply smells like you just stepped out of the shower after using a berry shower gel or shampoo, or maybe even both. The hint of musk, which is unusual in shower gels and such, does suggest that it must be a perfume.

Unfortunately, I am quite divided on the longevity of the scent; on skin and hair, I can't perceive the fragrance for long, and the sillage has never been as noteworthy as with other fragrances where people turn around and say ""Wow, what smells so wonderful?"". It's a pity because Gucci Rush 2 really has the potential to appeal to more people. On textiles, however, jackets and scarves, I can still perceive the scent for a long time, which makes me happy, but spending money on a ""bed spray"" is rather disappointing.

The bottle could have offered more; it looks modern and does justice to its plastic predecessor Gucci Rush, but a glass design might have made the concept much more appealing.
Pink plastic. The pink is great, no question - but a plastic bottle... well, the attempt to stand out from other bottles has, in my eyes, backfired.

It's a shame about Gucci Rush 2, which I really enjoy wearing, but the overall concept unfortunately does not do justice to the fragrance."
Rush 2,09/18/2017,Hasiputz80,F,34,,0,The one and only,"For over 15 years, this has been my recurring fragrance that manages to excite me every single time.
Back at the beginning of the new millennium when it had just been released, I tested it once and without hesitation had to have it immediately.
I must admit that it develops fantastically on me. Fresh yet somehow silky and powdery at the same time.
A colleague visited me today, and when I asked her (out of pure curiosity...not because it smelled so amazing) which fragrance she was wearing, she pulled out a bottle of Rush2 from her handbag.
I could hardly grasp it...very fruity and sweet, without any recognizability, it wafted from her to my nose.
Even when I applied it again on my wrist, that incredibly fine, noble aura was back, almost too beautiful to be true.

It's a shame that production is being discontinued."
Rush 2,11/12/2011,Chrissi1250,F,5,,13,Let the rush hour begin *,"In my opinion, this creation is a subtle and elegant product: the scent is discreet, almost subliminally present, but it does not stand out ""just passing by.""
The other side of ""rush 2"" is the gentle playfulness, almost a sense of risk, that the numerous floral-sweet fragrance components contribute. But now to the components...

Roses and daffodils are often mentioned in the same breath, occasionally combined. This is probably what they thought at Gucci: who doesn't love that delicate rose scent, which always feels spring-fresh and sweetly invigorating? Of course, that alone would be too little for a top-class fragrance like this: the daffodil flower catches the rather light and superficial rose scent as it falls and gives it a subtle but solid base: the creation now has a gentle, yet necessary weight.
To perfect the base, they also chose the musk component, which, when applied correctly, can elevate a fragrance to the ultimate aphrodisiac. Personally, I often find that this effect fails due to overly generous application, for example with some (male) Lacoste creations, but Gucci has done everything right in this case. The scent now has a perfectly rounded base thanks to components like musk, light exotic woods (palm), and a touch of forest moss, which work hand-in-hand, making it playful yet somewhat warm-hearted and serious at the same time...
With many fragrances, quickly fleeting - as is the case here - however, never to be underestimated is a good and well-defined top note - after all, it makes the first impression!
Especially the delicate, floral-sweet freesia component and the softly subtle lily of the valley send a playful and open-hearted message ahead...

In my view, the scent gives a woman a certain elegant, fresh, and cheerful touch in a way that is suitable for both everyday life and special occasions. Therefore, I would not give an explicit recommendation of ""only for the evening"" or ""only for parties"" - ""rush 2"" actually fits anytime.
However, I would limit the fragrance's capabilities during long evenings in clubs or similar places, as it tends to dissipate after a few hours in smoke and constant warmth...
Seasonally, ""rush 2"" does not need to be restricted, but the skin should always be freshly washed when applying the fragrance.

Gucci's ""rush 2"" is always gently perceptible - except under extreme conditions like smoke or sweat - yet I would recommend a moderate to generous application: about 2-3 sprays for the neck and/or ear areas. This way, the scent floats playfully and gracefully with every head movement and does not dissipate too quickly.

With Gucci's ""rush 2,"" a woman buys an invigorating, elegant, and pleasantly sweet all-time fragrance.
Almost suitable for every type of woman, this creation delights both attentive male and female noses ;-)"
Rush 2,04/06/2010,Antoine,F,207,,0,Brave Little Sister,"I assume that Rush sold satisfactorily, and that’s why Gucci came up with the idea to build on the success of Rush by launching a fragrance called Rush 2. The similarity to Rush is limited, which makes me wonder what the point is. In the top notes, I can still recognize a certain kinship, but then Rush 2 develops quite differently. It is lighter and much more streamlined than Rush, floral but not sweet. The quirky and threatening bass notes that Rush has are missing here; Rush 2 is more like a well-behaved recorder. The most striking thing about Rush 2 for me is a pronounced Nivea cream note.

I don’t find it unpleasant, but it’s also not a fragrance I would need. I probably would have described it more favorably if it had a different name. However, anyone named Rush 2 will be measured against the big sister Rush, and that’s a high bar to reach."
Rush 2,12/30/2020,QooQi,F,15,,6,Signature Scent,"Gucci Rush 2 has been with me for more than 15 years. First as a signature scent in my early 20s, and now I still reach for it often. It simply goes with everything, fresh, uncomplicated, and in my opinion so feminine. It's also the only fragrance that I have repurchased multiple times. It's a shame that it is no longer being produced."
Rush 2,09/23/2014,Noedde,F,51,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Hopeful Start with a Sweet Finish,"A new perfume is a must, urgently and immediately! So I have become a regular visitor to the local perfumery in search of it. The ladies see me almost daily at the moment. After testing Elie Saab and then Rush 2 yesterday morning, it quickly became clear that Elie Saab does not fit my preferences, so I dove into Rush 2. Since the opening was okay, almost delicate and not disturbing by my standards, I dared to spray myself quite heavily and then wait for my beloved oak moss in the base. Initially, everything was nice, perhaps a bit lacking in wood in the heart note for my taste, but I decided to wait. I did that - with high expectations for the base. Unfortunately, those were not met. Over time, a scent developed on my skin that constantly lingered unpleasantly in my nose and made me long enormously for a shower. I think it was the blackberry that developed very strongly and sweetly on me, leaving hardly any room for oak moss and musk, and this perfume has been kicked off my list."

Flora by Gucci,03/25/2013,Seatonica,F,21,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Chinese Osmanthus,"Looking at the notes I should love Gucci Flora, but something in the opening makes my nose twitch. As in allergy oh no I'm going to sneeze twitch. So it's not love I'm feeling as my sinuses fill up. Is peony the culprit? Or maybe the osmanthus? I think it's the osmanthus. The osmanthus note here is very similar to the one found in those eponymous perfumes that come out of China, more green and cloying than honeyed. And sorry to say I find this particular rendition of osmanthus, which blooms heady early on and lasts for hours on me, headache-inducing in a way I do not find in Keiko Mercheri's Osmanthus, for example, which I adore. It quite spoils my enjoyment of the powdery rose-patchouli combination that emerges in the middle stages as Lola observes. I have to thank the lovely rubyred for the sample but all this is to say that surprisingly Gucci Flora is not for me."
Flora by Gucci,01/22/2012,Sherapop,F,1240,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Office-Ready Inoffensive Fruity-Floral Frag,"I tested Gucci FLORA edp some time ago and found it not very exciting and somewhat homogenized, but I've decided to give this fragrance another sniff since I was recently sent a fresh sample of the edt.

Although it has become a common practice to change the formula of a perfume launched under the same name but in edt and edp concentrations, FLORA does not represent such a case, it seems. The notes are the same, so it should come as no surprise that the edt is simply a more dilute solution of the edp. I should say, however, that I have quite a bit more experience with osmanthus than I had the last time I tried FLORA.

Osmanthus is sort of a ready-made fruity-floral flower. It is light with a very subtle peachy quality. This is why compositions featuring osmanthus are almost by definition office-ready inoffensive fruity-floral frags (ORIFFF). If that's what you're looking for, then FLORA may work for you."

note of sandalwood rose and patchouli

behind dark crevasses in rocks or behind

Flora by Gucci,01/06/2012,Missk,F,1357,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Intimate and clean floral,"Nice, is a good word to describe Flora by Gucci. It's pleasant and clean, but rather boring and safe.

While obviously aimed at the younger market, Gucci chose to use a simplistic floral composition of citrus, peony, rose, osmanthus, patchouli and sandalwood. Not what I would call a daring combination.

At the time of this fragrance's release, most of the world was heading into the warmer months, however Australia was going into Winter. Because Flora is so light, fresh and powdery, I don't expect that this fragrance will be a best seller this month.

I would have liked to have seen some stronger floral notes such as; jasmine or orchid added to this fragrance to give it more of a kick. The scent as it is now is far too common for it to be outstanding.

I'm disappointed that this fragrance turned out to be so mainstream. With a name like Gucci, they could have easily gotten away with experimenting with new and unique floral combinations. Here's hoping that their next release, which is also rumoured to be aimed at the younger crowd, is much more daring."

10 years ago every teenage girl smelled of it, and It became too much for me. The fragrance started to annoy me, whenever I met it. And that was often and everywhere.
I got a half used bottle from a friend. I could not bear to tell her that I regarded Flora as an annoying scent so it was adopted. And just stood there on the shelf. Finally I sold it.

But with the first spray, I was irritated - I had expected something distinctly floral.
Instead, I was enveloped by fine, small flowers. Perhaps daisies?
That was my first association with the mild scent.
Actually very lovely.
The peony modestly makes its appearance, and the citrus notes are also finely balanced.
The rose remains discreetly in the background, but osmanthus elevates the whole delicate fragrance weave.
Above all, there is a hint of sandalwood.
Not a prominent, outstanding scent, but one that certainly has its place.
Especially in hot headache-inducing temperatures, it is very appropriate.
You smell subtly, without disturbing yourself or others.

Just perfumed, without edges, without depth, without development. No standout, not even pleasing. But I can't find a satisfying answer.

Gucci produces such fantastic fragrances! L'Arte di Gucci, THE oriental chypre sensation par excellence. My companion for half of the 90s. Or later Gucci Envy. A bold green herbal scent composition.

Flora by Gucci,08/07/2013,NiKaSi,F,57,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Part-Time,"Flora by Gucci has often been described here as a mild floral fragrance that doesn't have much to offer. I would like to defend the scent here - even if it's just a little.

I bought it some time ago out of pure boredom while browsing, and because I couldn't find anything that truly excited me, I bought it almost blindly, meaning I just sprayed it in the store, found it quite pleasant, and took it home. Today, I'm wearing it...

This morning, right upon spraying, I found Flora to be quite unremarkable, a floral scent that I couldn't clearly define, with a very faint citrus note. The next hour remained similar, but with a strange scratchy undertone that I could only smell close to my skin; if I waved my arm a bit further away, the scent aura was actually quite pleasant. After another hour, I reached the base, the scratchiness was gone (which I'm glad about!), and what remains is a soft, almost vanilla-like sandalwood scent, and I perceive a slight anise note, even though the fragrance contains nothing of the sort. For this base, I can rate it at 70%, otherwise it would be significantly lower.

So, in conclusion, I can say: the scent is pleasant, indeed nothing particularly outstanding, but a delicate companion for the day. I quite like wearing it in the office; it surrounds me with a gentle scent veil, but is at best only marginally noticed by colleagues. More is really not needed in a professional environment.

The longevity is average (it lasts about 4 hours on me), and the sillage is rather below average."

Flora by Gucci,05/23/2012,Sisyphos,M,143,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,With the Handbrake On,"Gucci's Eau de Toilette Flora doesn't get going. Citrus notes are not recognizable, and something vaguely reminiscent of rose petals might be there. The mention of osmanthus blossoms in the heart note doesn't help much. In the base, patchouli can still be suspected, but sandalwood fails to provide any new impulses to the overall scent progression, which is very modest. What I also think I can smell (although it's not listed) is something like delicate peach skin. A small glimmer of hope?

The bottle is nice, no question about it. When it comes to longevity and sillage, one must conclude: weak. Furthermore, the EdT is not exactly inexpensive compared to other perfumes. What is surprising in the base is a musty powderiness; it simply lacks liveliness and freshness.

Flora has no distinct character, no unique typicity. I can most easily imagine this scent, aside from the price, as a starter fragrance for teenagers. It is not particularly intense and lacks depth, avoiding all edges and corners. The fragrance components feel domesticated and muted, so you constantly have the feeling of driving up a hill in a small car with the handbrake on. And that’s just not fun."

Flora by Gucci,04/26/2010,Eternity,F,340,,6,Stop Sign,"I was somehow drawn to this name ""Flora"" and the bottle in the shape of a hexagon. Now I have learned that stop signs do not always have to be octagonal, because in the case of Flora, six corners are completely sufficient. I smell no rose, no sandalwood - nothing that inspires me or that I could elaborate on.
I am surrounded by a stuffy sweetness reminiscent of a Walt Disney little girl fragrance. In the Gucci online shop, the same scent notes are listed for both the EdT and the EdP. So there should also be mandarin, pepper, and other flowers playing a role here. To be honest, I really don't know what Flora is supposed to smell like - it certainly isn't flowers, unless we are talking about artificially scented, Chinese plastic rose imports. At best, I still perceive a Haribo Tropi Frutti scent of mandarin fruit - and that's it!
Either this is a really mediocre fragrance with way too high ambitions, or my nose is incapable of perceiving the notes. In dubio pro reo - so I gladly take the blame and declare my capitulation.

Really a shame, because with this bottle design and perfume name, one could have expected something great. Is this not one of this year's Fifi finalists? Well, I would gladly take any bet that it will not make it.

P.S.: This bottle and my fragrance sample (thanks to Elchen) is the EdT."

Flora by Gucci,10/31/2013,NadsSpatz,F,596,,3,One-Sided Floral Bouquet,"~ Inspiration ~
I was drawn to the special hexagonal shape of the bottle, but I'm still a bit confused about how many ""Flora"" variants there are...
The commercial honestly scares me a little :/

~ Bottle ~
A real gem! The shape stands out from other bottles and, with the thin black ribbon and the curved script, it looks elegant and feminine.

~ Fragrance ~
Upon spraying, I perceive a very light citrus and mandarin note, which, however, fades after a few seconds, making way for a lush bouquet of peonies and roses. It exudes a sweet-floral and slightly powdery scent. With osmanthus flowers, a hint of pink pepper, patchouli, and sandalwood, it softly concludes in the base.

~ Longevity ~
On my skin, it lasts about 5 hours (not much longer on clothing and hair). If I spray too much, it becomes too dry, synthetic, and scratchy in my throat.

~ Occasion ~
It fits well into the mild days of spring, summer, and autumn. Also suitable as a subtle office scent.

~ Conclusion ~
The slightly earthy-spicy osmanthus note bothers me, making it too unsweet for my taste."
Flora by Gucci,01/17/2010,Kittycat,F,280,,3,Lemon-Rose-Sandalwood,"I can’t enter a department store without visiting the perfume section. I’m probably not alone in this forum ... So, yesterday it was that time again, I specifically set out to try “Flora” by Gucci.
Upon spraying, the very lemony top note stands out, soon to be accompanied by a floral-woody note - no, not replaced, but rather complemented. The scent remains consistent throughout. DeGe53 was looking for the sandalwood, and I’ve found it ;-) I think the sandalwood is very present from the heart note onwards. At the very end, and only on the sidelines, the patchouli tries to make its presence known.
Overall, I don’t dislike “Flora,” but it won’t make it into my collection. Too bad, the bottle is exceptionally pretty."
Flora by Gucci,11/01/2011,Blondie70,F,19,,1,I can't smell anything!!!,"I received the fragrance as a gift, was excited and sprayed and sprayed - but I can't smell anything, almost nothing. When I press my nose to the spot where I sprayed, I can smell a tiny bit, but that has never happened to me with a perfume before. In the end, I gave the bottle to my mother, who thought it was great, well, if she thinks so. I can't even describe this scent because I really smell hardly anything; what I do smell is a little floral, but that fades away after a few seconds."
Flora by Gucci,03/09/2011,Secret,F,43,,2,old & dusty,"smells old and musty somehow.
you can clearly smell citrus and patchouli.
and well...I think this scent is okay for older people..."
Flora by Gucci,09/07/2009,Schnuffi,F,212,,2,what was I thinking...,"When I smelled the fragrance about 4 months ago, I thought it was amazing.
Now, after the birth of my daughter, I just wonder what I was thinking. The scent is certainly not bad. But I can no longer perceive it after 1 hour of spraying. The fragrance reminds me a lot of Kiton Donna. It is much sweeter and doesn't last as long."
Flora by Gucci,01/08/2011,Ingepetra,F,232,,2,beautiful bottle!,"but for Gucci, a scent that is far too weak. You have to hurry to catch a whiff of the pleasant floral fragrance or quickly reapply.
oh, it's just a shame about the beautiful patchouli and peony"
Flora by Gucci,08/01/2009,DeGe53,F,560,,2,Well..,"The scent was sprayed on me today at Karstadt!!! (Permission granted) The opening is very nice, fresh, light, powdery-floral. But that’s about it. It doesn’t last, has no depth. Not even sufficient for summer. I’m a bit disappointed, not even my beloved sandalwood comes through."
Bloom Acqua di Fiori,03/11/2018,QuercusAlbus,M,72,,2,Über-Fougère,"The title here is that which instantly springeth to mind @ first intraspiration: it's like when one is out on a country walk, & there's just been rain; and the path has become overgrown, so one flails @ the obstructing herbeage with one's walking-stick (the law proscribes the carrying of machètée in England!). Sometimes when one does this, the blast of broken-stem aroma is overwhelming; & this 'fume is a bit like that. It does settle down though, with the ancilliary muskinesses & ambrinesses phasing in really quite seamlessly - by which I mean, not merely displacing the intense fougère-ity, but kind of softening & blunting the °thorns° in suchwise as that they do not °tear° @ one so much."
Bloom Acqua di Fiori,07/26/2018,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,33,Green is the Hope,"After a stuffy hot day, I now throw open all the windows and doors at night - boldly even the front door.

I need the cool night air - no matter who now strolls in unhindered.

I enjoy the draft that sweeps through all the rooms, blowing away the fatigue of the day.
Why am I not as awake in the morning as I am at night?

And Bloom Acqua di Fiori helps me with my wakefulness.

This fragrance greets me with a fresh green, like my garden after the long-awaited downpour.
The lawn now lies lush and gleaming in the moonlight, having soaked up the rain.
Light spots from my lanterns dance over it, seeming to move the flowers and bushes.
Jasmine and tuberose breathe a sigh of relief, for the day was hot.
They also welcome the damp coolness.
Sandalwood embraces the vegetation against my skin, and the moonlight gives it an emerald tone.

I have hope for a good new day."
Bloom Acqua di Fiori,05/01/2018,Duftsucht,F,137,,11,"What one has too much of, the other has too little","Gucci Bloom caught my eye when I was looking for a feminine-floral-not-sweet-adult fragrance: Because of its beautiful packaging! Unfortunately, the tuberose also caught me - in the nose - and thus the scent was immediately off my list. I was eagerly awaiting Bloom Acqua di Fiori - the fragrance pyramid promised something like a Bloom light. And this promise is indeed kept by the scent. Jasmine and tuberose are still in the lead role, but softened by a little fruit, a little resin, a little wood. And therein lies my problem: Yes, I know, you will say that you really can't please everyone, and that might be true. But Acqua di Fiori just feels a bit arbitrary. I still find the scent pleasant, but I seriously doubt that I would recognize it if a lady in my vicinity were wearing it. Additionally, the top note smells a bit synthetic to my nose. However, I can very well imagine that Bloom Acqua di Fiori will find a fan base - perhaps also among younger ladies and girls - especially in summer. I will certainly enjoy using the sample during my summer vacation, but the scent will not make it onto my wish list. Have fun testing it yourself!"
Bloom Acqua di Fiori,06/17/2018,Panterrarty,F,4,,9,Interesting,"When Gucci Bloom came out and I sniffed it, I found it quite nice, but since I don't wear such heavily floral and powdery scents at all, I didn't know what to expect from this one.
But to my surprise, this one was so completely different.
It was as if I were smelling the stems of the flowers from Bloom.
Then I had an idea:
I sprayed the Aqua on and followed it with a regular Bloom. The result was very interesting.
That's when I started experimenting.
Since my nose likes citrus scents, I added some D&G Light Blue to the Gucci fragrance. A very cool variation. I was often told that I smelled very summery and fresh without being too overpowering. Which is really cool with the lemon from DG, to tone it down a bit.
I really enjoy experimenting, this way I also finish a few perfumes faster :P

Conclusion about the scent:
Doesn't last forever. I wouldn't wear it alone. In combination, very nice!"
Bloom Acqua di Fiori,03/19/2019,Gelis,F,328,,10,Scratchy Blooms,"Bloom Acqua di Fiori is somehow ""scratchy""-floral for me, while being airy and also a bit soapy. I couldn't really name a single fragrance note. The sillage is in the lower mid-range. This makes the scent suitable for everyday wear, fitting for any occasion in spring and summer. After about three and a half hours, the base notes slowly start to come into play, making the fragrance a bit rounder, softer, but the scratchiness of the opening doesn't completely fade away. And that's what ultimately makes me dislike the fragrance overall. After about 7 ½ hours, ""Bloom Acqua di Fiori"" then fades away for me.

I thank Skripka22 for the opportunity to test this."
Bloom Acqua di Fiori,02/15/2022,Annesyb,F,6,,15,Floral Green - Not Green Floral,"Another one of those Gucci fragrances that could split opinions. Gucci Bloom and its fragrance offspring live up to their name and were all too floral, too sweet, or both for me - well made, but just not quite my style. Acqua di Fiori, however, is a bit different and just my thing. The opening begins with stepping into a flower shop. If I'm not mistaken, someone has already..."
Bloom Acqua di Fiori,12/31/2022,Amenvodka,M,2,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Unisex Potential,"Floral, green, almost not powdery and absolutely no sweetness: The scent has unexpected unisex qualities, for me it is a solid everyday companion. For the man who likes to smell freshly showered. It can also be layered very well with simple citrus perfumes, smells great with Eau de Gaga (unfortunately hardly available on the market anymore)."
Bloom Acqua di Fiori,10/17/2023,MrsAlexWer,F,6,,3,Every Year a New Surprise.,"For me, the most beautiful from the entire Gucci Bloom range.
Every year, when spring arrives, I am always on the lookout in my collection for a really beautiful spring fragrance that is light, floral, but not too sweet. Every year I ponder which scent I could choose and whether I need a new one now. And every year I rediscover it among the many perfumes and think: oh no. I had you last year. And every year, after the first spray, I realize again: no, you stay with me. You are my spring messenger.

The scent is floral, fresh, and a little powdery, but not sweet at all. Just as one imagines the delicate scents in March and April. Before the concentrated sweetness hits you in May."
Flora by Gucci,09/29/2012,LadyRogue,F,166,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,A Classy Floral,"This fruity floral (more floral than fruity) is in my opinion just as classy and chic smelling as the bottle looks.

Juicy, creamy osmanthus infused with soft citric's, a strong peony note, a rose with a whiff of vanilla leading to a drydown with a hint of sandalwood to give the florals a well chosen 'earthy' vibe. This is how this elegant scent unfolds on my skin.

An all-rounder that behaves at all occasions, I can't see you going wrong wearing this. It's like a little black dress among florals, it is versatile and classy. A well blended and timeless perfume. I daresay that people who normally wouldn't like florals might find this beauty appealing.

Silage is: ""a classy and beautiful floral aura with fruity moments and an apparition of sandalwood that enhances its beauty."" -- Longevity is very different from person to person. On me it's a satisfying 5+ hours if applied on clothes too.

Not the cheapest scent and notoriously moody depending on chemistry, so sample on skin before purchase to avoid buying a pretty yet fleeting disappointment. Good luck! : )"
Flora by Gucci,02/25/2021,Scentility,F,32,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Joyful playful free spirited Flora,"Flora by Gucci has recently entered my collection. Overall, I absolutely adore it and it is definitely going to be one of my favorites. It’s probably pretty underrated and I am not sure why because to me it’s just gorgeous from the packaging to the juice inside the hexagon shaped bottle with the black bow on top. The box has stunning artwork of beautiful floral designs. I usually put the boxes away but I kept this one on my dresser. It’s joyful playful and gives me free spirited boho vibes. I do believe it’s more of a summer or spring fragrance as the projection is not very strong even for edp. I originally thought it might be more of a winter perfume, but it’s just not that heavy. It’s more of a citrusy osmanthus and I do not detect much Rose or patchouli in this. It’s a very well blended citrusy almost fruity floral, so it’s difficult to see if any notes really stand out. It’s just a very pleasant charming scent that you can hardly go wrong with purchasing blindly unless you really dislike citrusy notes that are not very strong at all. It makes me think of sun, summer and strolling somewhere in the Mediterranean. Somehow I think of my recent trip to Portugal. I love the ad, I love the bottle I love the perfume. I am charmed. It is adorable."
Flora by Gucci,02/20/2012,Missk,F,1357,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Not much more exciting than the EDT,"I gave Flora by Gucci a fair enough chance. I tried both the EDT and EDP versions on the skin and on a card, and yet neither excites me.

Flora EDP is just too much of something. Perhaps it's too sweet, too creamy or just too floral. Something about this composition unnerves me.

When settled on the skin, Flora EDP smells like a bar of soap. Clean and pleasant but nothing that could cause any heads to turn in your direction. Perhaps it is that inoffensive, quiet feeling that has so many people loving this fragrance.

I hate to say it, but Flora comes across as rather synthetic to my nose. If it smelt like a natural bouquet of flowers I probably wouldn't dislike this fragrance so much. That odd creaminess makes me prefer an unscented lotion over and above this fragrance, both of them creating the same feeling.

Flora is restricted to the floral category, even though it attempts to become earthy with the patchouli in the base. I managed to wear this fragrance for the duration that it lasted, which was an impressive seven or so hours. Flora EDP was unfortunately so very linear over this time, that it showed barely signs of depth or complexity."
Flora by Gucci,01/13/2019,Fiqwerty,F,1,,2,Spring scent,"This fragrance is very flowery, like the name already indicates. It is verg recognizable and very feminine. Loved it! It also stayed on for a long time. With only two sprays, people would still compliment my parfume at the end of the day."
Flora by Gucci,08/16/2018,Jazzy76,F,320,,0,Jeune fille en fleur (girl in bloom),"This scent is a hymn to feminity : floral, fresh, but also warm and sensual.
At the opening I smell mainly the peony notes with a very light citric touch, not at all sour, then The floery heart arrives to my nose revealing the osmanthus, warm, not too intoxicating but well balanced. It could be weird but on my skin I didn't smell the rose I see in the pyramid.
The base notes, which last on my skin for a few hours, are warm and sweet (not sweetish): a not earty patchouli and a very light and pleasant sandalwood. The sillage is quite good, although I was expecting more from an eau de parfum. Anyway, a very feminin and pleasant fragrance contained in a simple but elegant bottle. The price is quite high, but I recommend it to the ""girls in bloom "" of all ages, expecially in springtime-summer."

Flora by Gucci,04/25/2020,Nickhun1,F,12,,0,"Flora, the Overlooked Goddess","You spend forever thinking about which fragrance is the one, the absolute must-have that you need to buy, and then treasures like this one go completely unnoticed. And this despite the fact that Flora is one of the perfumes I have repurchased for the 3rd or 4th time and comes into play absolutely reliably every spring/summer. I thought I wasn't really into flowers, but the composition of Flora is special! An absolutely refined and addictive scent.

My husband was sniffing at my neck the whole time while shopping yesterday! ;-)

Flora is actually a calm yet unusual companion for the day. You spray sunshine directly from the bottle! I do smell flowers in the top note, but I can't name them individually, and I would have never guessed rose was behind it.

I think it's the osmanthus that captivates and takes me in, giving Flora that exotic kick! I found osmanthus extremely sexy in Paco Rabanne's Ultraviolette... with Flora, I also smell vanilla... no idea why? Maybe it's the mix of flowers, osmanthus, and the woody notes that makes it seem so seductive and vanilla-like?! Regardless, what a beautiful companion! The bottle is a feast for the eyes, a bit playful, but Flora is a little like that too... the longevity is fantastic... I could smell it on me from 7 AM until late in the evening! Unfortunately, I can't say the same about many other scents currently on the market! The sillage is in the medium range, but I don't need more; I want to enjoy the scent experience myself without annoying other people with it.

If you're looking for a new fragrance, definitely try Flora, the sunny flower goddess!"
Flora by Gucci,07/19/2015,Slnthrs,F,3,,13,Warm Late Summer Days on a Golden Meadow,"Flora is, for me, a perfect perfume for mild summer evenings. If a sunset on a hot late summer day had a scent, it would definitely be Flora. Warm and sensual are the two adjectives that come to mind first when I spray Flora.
At first, the scent is very intense and too sweet. Fortunately, this sweetness dissipates quickly and transforms into a creamy, warm, floral fragrance. When I wear Flora, I often get told that I smell very good, which unfortunately is not the case with other fragrances I have, as they are not as long-lasting. Flora remains perceptible for 12 hours without any problems. Of course, towards the end, it becomes just a very close-to-skin scent. Only on clothing does the fragrance actually last until the next wash. Due to its long-lasting nature and the intense, yet not overpowering scent, Flora is truly perfect for going out in the summer.
Since the eye always ""smells along,"" I want to mention the bottle, which really looks extremely decorative on the shelf."
Flora by Gucci,10/16/2010,Turandot,F,839,,12,This could have been something,"It’s (not just) the same story with Gucci every time. A fragrance is launched, powered by advertising, sales are quite alright, and six months later, another concentration pushes its way onto the shelf. Instead of giving the fragrance time to establish itself, it is already overshadowed by the next one (Guilty) and hardly has the chance to be repurchased.

Now, I am biased in truly evaluating Flora, as I don’t like sweet fruity-floral scents. And you can’t really talk about longevity. But it was well received. Especially among young, very fashionable ladies, it found a following. The packaging, which is said to be inspired by the 2009 fashion collection, also looks appealing.

But as I said, hardly can the child walk somewhat, the sibling comes along and takes all the attention away. What a shame....."
Flora by Gucci,01/29/2021,Nadine21287,F,28,,11,A fragrance that deserves much more attention,"I still see my former best friend, her mother always stored her expensive perfumes in her room back then. And I see how my friend wrapped it in a thick scarf and wore it in winter. She was the goddess.

I absolutely do not like floral fragrances, but I love this one. To this day, I hardly know anyone who wears it, UNFORTUNATELY. It is so soft, so cuddly, and yet so present. An absolute feel-good fragrance for me, which carries many powdery elements.

You really have to try it, especially the ladies who are not into floral scents."
Flora by Gucci,09/15/2022,Kvsd,F,4,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,You and me?,"Oh Flora - you and me - that's probably not going to happen. It all started so beautifully. I still remember standing with my friends in front of the perfume shelf. It was supposed to be a new scent. Actually, everyone was just annoyed and wanted me to decide quickly. They only came out of politeness or boredom, as I was already the one with the ""perfume obsession"" and spent every day hanging out in perfume shops. So I had to decide quickly.

Chloé was heavily advertised, which was also quite new on the market at the time, and you. Both sprayed, both heavenly. Damn. Somehow, I found you both quite similar with my untrained nose back then, probably the rose. I deemed Chloé a tad better and quickly chose it, but you, Flora, never left my mind!

And you've been holding on for 13 years now. There are perfumes that don't last this long on the market. Unfortunately, you were never a real hit, even though you are so beautiful. Floral describes you perfectly, a bit velvety, and the sillage is fantastic. Every time I spray you in the perfume shop, I smell you on my wrist all day long. You are fresh, yet not too much, fruity, but not overwhelming. I don't perceive patchouli in you, but various flowers that I can't quite identify in their abundance. You are actually perfect.

But then came my first own apartment, and there was never enough money anyway, then other scents entered my life and well, you’re probably rolling your eyes, we all know the excuses. In 2018, I almost bought you spontaneously, but once again, I put you back on the shelf and chose another.

Now you seem to be slowly disappearing from all the stores, and you have namesakes on the market. I don't even want to call them daughters, as they have nothing in common with you. If I don't get extremely lucky and happen to grab you somewhere very spontaneously, it seems like it won't happen between us. Which is a real shame! Adieu and perhaps farewell - dear Flora."
Flora by Gucci,03/21/2013,Tooodschick,F,49,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,The Adult Floral Fragrance,"It smells floral, as one might expect from the name.
But it doesn't smell girlishly innocent floral; rather, it has a ladylike quality.
This fragrance smells warm, elegant, and slightly sweet. A sort of adult version of the many floral scents available on the market. I own it and like it very much. It is not an everyday scent for me, as I feel it doesn’t quite emphasize ME. This fragrance is, for me personally, something for special occasions. I enjoy wearing it and feel more grown-up with it. In my eyes, it even radiates a bit of arrogance. The longevity of the scent is good. It lasts well through a workday or otherwise. I would recommend it for women who appreciate elegant fashion and prefer a classic style."
Flora by Gucci,03/09/2021,Kadse,F,2,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Goddess for the Summer Evening,"I really love this perfume. When I first smelled it, I had a very specific image in my mind:

It was a very hot summer day. At some point between the afternoon and the evening sun, there was a heavy downpour with thunder and a stormy wind. The hot weather had to release itself. After the weather calmed down, the goddess emerges. The last yellow, neon-orange, pink, violet, and bright red sunrays penetrate through the gray ceiling facade made of clouds. The air is still a bit fresh after the rain, but the sunrays of the beautiful evening sun bring back some warmth.
The air reminds one of the sea. You feel as if you are in a Mediterranean setting, where history, aesthetics, and elegance meet nature. A beautiful combination, just like the flora: warm, divine, feminine, precious, natural, but also artistic, elegant, beautiful, powerful, and yet tender, simply WOW.

Once again, I really love this perfume. I prefer to wear it during an evening stroll or dinner by the lake after it has rained. I don’t know, but in that moment, I have such a beautiful feeling, a feeling that I would love to have forever."
Flora by Gucci,04/29/2012,Millefiori,F,12,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Flora,"is the goddess of bloom, youth, and joyful enjoyment of life in Roman mythology. In allegorical representations of the four seasons, she embodies spring.

Flora by Gucci starts off fruity-sweet. Very sweet. I distinctly perceive freshly peeled mandarin, very ripe, very delicious, but after just a few minutes, the fruity aroma is overshadowed by a musty, piercing scent that reminds me of mandarin peels forgotten in a plastic bag for hours.
This note accompanies the transition to floral notes, which now begins with the heavy sweetness of osmanthus. I must admit, I have never smelled osmanthus flowers, but I associate this somewhat stuffy sweetness with them, as I know rose and peony, yet cannot perceive either of those here.
For several hours, the scent lingers, remaining sweet and cloying on my skin, still underlined by something musty-fruity.
Only in the base - I have waited a long time for this - does the sandalwood lighten the sweetness. And now, finally, the rose can contribute its fine, herb-sweet powderiness to the scent's conclusion in a soothing manner.

On my skin, the longevity is (too) good; perhaps it only seems that way because there are several aspects that bother me. The one-dimensionality in the scent development may be the reason for the somewhat synthetic impression that ""Flora"" leaves on me. Overall, I would wish for more genuine floral notes in a ""goddess-of-flowers fragrance.""

This perfume was a gift from a good friend. Flora and I have not become friends. Fortunately, the good friend is still one!"
Flora by Gucci,08/18/2020,Juliajawskij,F,2,,8,Subtle Summer Night Seduction,"Floral, yet not too sweet.
Mature, but playful.
Seductive, without being overtly sexy.

A fragrance that is clearly a beloved all-rounder for me and, despite this quality, is eye-catching. And it’s also a compliment magnet."
Flora by Gucci,12/31/2011,Hobbit,F,104,,1,not bad at all even without floral love,"I confess I am more against than for floral scents, so why am I sniffing Flora? Good question? The hype, the advertising? (which I even liked) I think it's both :D

The first time I sniffed this fragrance, I was so little put off that I had to go back to the tester shortly after :)

This floral note is at least not as intrusive and headache-inducing as so many other floral scents; perhaps it’s the pleasantly noticeable warmth of sandalwood that makes the fragrance enjoyable for me..

I wouldn’t buy it, but if someone in my environment wore the scent, it wouldn’t bother me."
Flora by Gucci,04/18/2025,Kerkyra74,F,669,,4,Elegant Compliment Getter,"Those were still bouquets from the house of Gucci, not to be compared with the ""new"" floral line. The nicely designed bottles don't help, even if it's a matter of taste. In the Flora Gucci 2009 bottle, I most distinctly perceive the roses in the opening, no harsh patch and a stronger honey note (Osmanthus? Actually a red flag candidate for me), which becomes subtler in the heart. DD pleasantly woody spice. 6 candidates that create a beautiful fragrance pyramid, a classic that is timelessly created."
Envy,07/15/2012,jtd,M,484,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Floral imitation.,"Why is this called Envy? Should it inspire envy? Symbolize envy? Should I value envy? Sounds much more like a Calvin Klein fragrance wanna-be name, but I bought it, so who’s to say the marketing didn’t work? No. 19 is a sharp green floral, PR Metal is a flinty green floral, Alliage is a cool green floral. Envy is a sour green floral. Bitter works wonderfully in perfume, hence all the great leathers and chypres. Sour is another story entirely. Sour, as in acidic, can add balance to food, but doesn’t really have a comparable place in fragrance. It’s sort of like coffee in that respect. Bitter coffee is an ideal, sour coffee is a shame.

But the sourness here adds a bit of fruit that ties together the green and white florals and makes the whole thing soapy, if a bit cold. I wear it occasionally, and, interestingly, this is one of the few fragrances that people smell on me (a man) and comment positively on. I think sour reads to some people as a sibling tone to the popular “fresh” and “sport.”

I come back to this one occasionally, but I’ve never really grown fond of it. It is an insecticide-like floral, with references to floral notes but not the feel of bloom to it. I think it is the soapiness that makes me not write it off, but I can’t say it is an enjoyable fragrance."
Envy,03/28/2012,Sherapop,F,1240,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,I Became Green with Envy,"Gucci ENVY edt opens propitiously with patches of lily of the valley peppering pastures of springtime grass gently swaying in the breeze. Fresh and clean, green without the mean. If I could call a halt to the trajectory of this fragrance at about the thirty-minute mark, we would be best friends.

Unfortunately, what ensues is a metamorphosis into a synthetic-smelling drydown, as though the flowers became frozen in motion through a process of plastification, and the grass suddenly hardened to artificial turf. These disturbingly sturdy components may well last for eternity--or until the wearer decides to take a vigorous bath, whichever comes first!

With such a splendid array of notes, I had high hopes for ENVY, especially when I found out that it was a floral green which I had somehow neglected for so many years. Now it becomes clear, however, that it wasn't meant to be. The reason is as plain as can be: ENVY does not like my skin or me!"
Envy,01/26/2012,Missk,F,1357,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Modern green floral,"I don't usually like fresh, green scents, however in this situation I really enjoyed wearing Envy.

Upon first application, Envy is very green and quite refreshing. The fruits balance themselves out nicely along with the magnolia and freesia. Thankfully pineapple is a subtle note here, because with most perfumes pineapple likes to rear its ugly head and cause me to dislike a scent.

As the fragrance settles on the skin it becomes increasingly grassy, but not sharp like Chanel No.19. Envy is tame and polite, it doesn't like to make a loud, obtrusive statement.

Envy feels very modern for its time. Its slight metallic-like quality captivates me. Although Envy is something that I probably wouldn't wear, I am very intrigued by it. Envy fascinated me from the very beginning to the very end.

The lasting strength is average, if not a little better than average. Like I mentioned before this isn't a particularly strong scent, so I'd say it is fairly intimate. A green floral that I do surprisingly recommend."
Envy,03/14/2024,MrsGuerlain,F,548,,2,Irresistible…,"When this was released I remember falling in love immediately. Envy is fresh, floral and totally irresistible. It is the smell of summer.
The beginning is sharp. Fresh. Fruity. Lovely. Modern. It lasts for more than ten hours and I often wear it at work. It is however a scent that is not wearable by all. A dear friend of mine smells like rotten fruit and dirty clothes. She loves the fragrance, but she turns to Chanel no. 19 or Gres Cabotine instead. I have not been able to work out which note it is that conflicts with her skin but maybe I will one day.
Well done, Tom Ford, designing the bottle.

Envy,12/28/2012,Spring67,F,4,HELPFUL REVIEW,16,Comeback with Envy,"Thanks to the many great comments here, Envy has been positively brought back to my memory.
I owned this wonderful fragrance in the late 90s along with many other perfumes like Loulou, Joop Femme, Escada by Escada, Jádore, Poison, and also Sun was very present.
Admittedly, I can't imagine any of these scents in my collection today, and that's why I hesitated a bit about whether I would still like Envy today? because my fragrance preferences have changed significantly over time. But Envy holds special value for me, as it was my first Mother's Day gift from my now 16-year-old daughter. We mothers know what a sensitive time we go through at first... first Christmas, first Easter, and also the first Mother's Day, sigh, it's been a long time! Sorry, I'm digressing, now to the scent:
Bold, ordered, and arrived yesterday! (Allegedly the first women's fragrance from Gucci). Envy is a green floral scent, very sensual and feminine with a touch of freshness and by no means sweet. Although it is categorized here more as a spring-summer fragrance, I find it very suitable for a rainy day like today, enveloped with the first signs of spring;) There’s also nothing to complain about in terms of longevity, it lasts for hours on me.
The top notes are said to include bergamot, pineapple, as well as freesia and peach, which my nose cannot confirm. The lily of the valley dominates from beginning to end, beautifully merging in the base with moss and woody notes.
As Joe already mentioned, it also reminds me a bit of Diorissimo.
In summary: Envy, I still like you, and I am glad to have you back in my possession!"
Envy,02/11/2014,Kugeldistel,F,101,,10,Green Spring Messenger,"I would like to dedicate my first comment to one of my favorite fragrances that is no longer available. An old saying goes that envy makes one ugly. This is not true - at least not when one wears Envy, because this creation by Gucci comes from a time when this house stood for style and elegance with Italian flair and not for status symbols for Mr. and Mrs. Nouveau Riche.
Envy opens with a rather strong floral cloud. However, it is rather cool and bright, exuding the bouquet of hyacinths, violets, and early lily of the valley, interspersed with bitter, leafy nuances and a hint of freesias. Very soon after, the fragrance becomes softer and rounder, evolving into a green-woody veil that beautifully counteracts the scent of the lily of the valley and prevents it from becoming too sweet.
A brilliant fragrance that can be worn around the clock thanks to its subtle sillage. Compared to the discreet scents of more recent times, it still knows little restraint. In this sense, it is truly an olfactory child of the nineties."
Envy,08/30/2012,MariElla,F,53,,13,Dewdrops in the Grass,"Wearing Envy is like:

a wonderful early summer day, I am already awake quite early, everyone is still sleeping, it is completely quiet.
I roll up my pant legs and walk barefoot into the garden, running over the dew-soaked grass.
Wonderful, my toes tingle, it is sooo nice to feel the soft, cool grass.
I close my eyes and smell the leaves of the trees, absorbing their scent, the air is clear and fresh.
The sun rises, gradually the birds awaken first and then the people, it gets noisy, but that doesn’t bother me, because “my” garden is like a little oasis in the busyness that is now spreading.
I feel good, am relaxed, and look forward to breakfast and the first cup of tea with my loved ones in the house.

I have known Envy for a long time, it is a cheerful yet elegant fragrance.
I perceive the top note as citrusy, fresh, I wouldn’t associate it with magnolia.
It fades quite quickly and green notes emerge, there is also a bit of light wood in it. Overall very pleasant, subtly intertwined. The flowers are more in the background.
I find the base to be slightly powdery, warm, very subtle.
I don’t find Envy sweet overall.
A fragrance that fits well into the warm months of the year, but I wear it all year round when I crave “tingly feet”.
The longevity is good, the sillage is pleasant."

""I would love to recommend my tailor to you, but unfortunately, he is dead""
Dialogue of a typical gold chain gangsta with an Italian mafioso from an action blockbuster.

I discovered Envy post mortem, the elegant Italian fashion designer Envy is unfortunately dead.
The color green fits the name more in my opinion than the scent. I absolutely do not find it green-fresh. It is somewhat soapy, but still elegant. I have never smelled such stylishly packaged lily of the valley. It is a uniquely beautiful companion and I believe many will mourn the scent."
Envy,12/02/2014,Babymops,F,39,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Real Flowers in a Meadow,"I love this scent! It's somehow fresh, yet warm and floral!
I won it blind on eBay back then!
I thought to myself, Gucci must be good :) yep, hit!
For me, it's a classic!
At first glance, the bottle looked masculine to me and not very appealing...the yellow color of the fragrance is also not that interesting! Then I sprayed it on my skin! At first, it smelled like alcohol and somewhat fresh...and like moss... :/ well, not so thrilling...but then suddenly the flowers joined in! And bam, it was feminine! And so sexy! It smells to me like sex on a flower meadow :)
Or at least a hot date at a picnic :) where you feed each other grapes and have lily of the valley in your hair!
At least on me, it smells stunning :) I know, self-praise stinks, but in this case, it smells hot :D It's such a special scent that develops differently! It's not overly sweet and therefore a real change from my other fragrances! I think that's why it's so interesting! Many smell like synthetic plastic flowers, but real flowers???? I find it smells really natural! Just like how lily of the valley can only smell in moss! Plus, the musk makes it warm and adds the love in! A truly rounded overall package!
Unfortunately, production has been discontinued...for whatever reason?!
Luckily, I still have one in reserve :D

I don't know what that creepy advertising image with the creepy girl is supposed to mean! But the other sexy pictures capture it well! It's definitely not creepy :)))))

So for me personally, it belongs to my absolute favorite perfumes! Unfortunately, I'm afraid to use it because it's no longer being produced :-( whhhyyyyyy only"
Envy,06/21/2024,DuftPerle1,F,2,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,A Scent Full of Nostalgia,"Envy was the first fragrance I fell in love with, and it introduced me to the world of perfumes a few years later - so beware, this review is full of nostalgia.

Not your typical choice for a teenager, right? Well, I received it as a gift from my mother, who actually hates it, and it immediately became my favorite scent, pushing all the woody and vanilla fragrances aside on my shelf. Ah, those high school days when Envy harmonized so well with cigarette smoke and wild trips! It is crisp, strict, and so chic that it reminds me of Kate Moss from the 90s.

For me, it is truly a masterpiece, a penetrating blend of oak moss and lily of the valley. It's a shame that it is no longer produced; I wish they would create such green floral scents again. I only have 15 ml left and can't bring myself to wear it, as I guard it like a dragon. I bought CdG Celluloid Galbanum in the hope of rediscovering the familiar scent, but it's not the same; it is green, yes, but simpler and bolder."
Envy,12/11/2012,Markyta,F,86,,8,Desirably Different,"Today, Gucci essentially offers a profile-less uniform scent. Envy was different, unremarkable yet still special. A composition of various essences, each of which could have easily become intrusive and unpleasant, so perfectly balanced that it is a true pleasure to sniff. For me, Envy is like the dress for the best friend's wedding; you don't want to steal the spotlight, but..."
Envy,05/18/2015,Badolu,F,1,,8,"Envy, I Miss You!",I love this scent and have been searching for a worthy successor for years. Who can help me?????
Envy,05/05/2011,Silca,F,7,,4,my first comment...,"...that I am writing here for the first time and specifically about Envy has no particular reason, it just brings back some not-so-nice memories for me.

I had this fragrance many years ago (in my -young-and-stupid-time - how could I have back then?) and I still remember well, it evokes a feeling in me like a lemon that you just look at and everything tightens up.
This green is simply too much for me.
Even though I haven't sniffed it in years, it is still in my nose.
Although, one should never say never, maybe I should give it another try?"
Envy,12/06/2010,Ginger,F,23,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,beautiful green scent,"when I feel like a green scent, Gucci Envy is the first one that comes to mind.
I find the top note has something of green apples, but not so dominant; there are also other green fragrance notes that I can't quite place. (Maybe fresh leaves??)

In any case, very delicious and fresh, and perfectly suitable for spring/summer.

I also prefer to spray it on my hair or clothes, as the top note lasts longer that way.

The base then goes in the direction of woods/musk; I find the longevity very good, even though it is a very light scent."
Envy,06/19/2023,Rehbaby,F,1,,5,nothing but envy....,"a long time ago, it was in the nineties. My colleague wore this scent, she was always perfectly styled, only designer clothes on her body. Quite cool and arrogant, the only thing I liked about her was ENVY.
At some point, long after that, I discovered Gucci Envy while browsing the internet and bought it on a whim. And there it was again, the memory of that unsympathetic colleague.

But the scent is still something very special today.... even on me. Like a warm summer meadow that you take to bed, because the longevity is insane.
I love this perfume ️"
Envy,02/24/2024,Mumpel,F,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Gucci Envy … Memoire,"I had wanted to experience this discontinued fragrance again for so long, and thanks to a dear Parfumo, this became possible.
Finally, the moment arrived, and I applied Envy to my left wrist. Let's see, I closed my eyes in curiosity and waited to see what would happen. Would the scent be as I remembered it? Would it transport me back to the time when it was my signature scent?
I enjoyed the moment as I perceived lily of the valley, violet, and then cedar. A broad grin spread across my face as I opened my eyes. Yes, just as I remembered it!!! And then came the sobering realization… it didn't take me back in time. Strange, for so many years, this bottle was everything to me, yet it brought back no experiences.
Today, when I choose my perfumes based on mood, occasion, feelings, season, etc., it's completely different… every moment with a fragrance is a memory.
But as a very dear Parfumo said, ""On your fragrance journey, you've probably passed by so many wonderful perfumes…"" Yes, he is right, and that's a good thing…
It was lovely to test Envy again, but now I know that for me, I don't need a signature scent, but rather a fragrance journey filled with many wonderful memories."
Envy,05/19/2025,KML,F,15,,4,Masterpiece,"I associate Gucci Envy with the image of an elegant spring pattern in pastel shades, inspired by harmonious scent notes, it feels like a gust of wind bringing spring, a green floral accord characterized by lily of the valley and hyacinth, and has a metallic quality.
This unique fragrance was released in 1997, and the gifted perfumer is Maurice Roucel. He created Envy in a way that gives me vibes of modern architecture while avoiding floral ornaments and simplifying the form, which is also reflected in the sleek chic bottle. Roucel's composition starts with the transparency of green flowers and a high green note, accentuated by the saltiness of metal. The composition is radiantly clean, clear, elegant, and confidently feminine with a high recognition factor! Oh yes, Gucci Envy is practically always on my wish list; of course, I am aware that production has unfortunately been discontinued. I have been wondering for years why this successful and sought-after formula hasn’t simply been revived… Maybe someone among you knows the background to this… Envy remains one of the best compositions for me in the 'green floral freshie' category!"
Envy,09/30/2014,Sunnyiland,F,36,,2,"I like it terribly, but unfortunately it gives me headaches :o(","I really like this Gucci Envy, even though I'm not much of a citrus fan when it comes to perfume. Unfortunately, it always gives me terrible headaches. I have no idea why. So far (thankfully) this is the only EDT perfume that has done this to me. It's a great scent, and I can't wear it... I bought it many years ago and have tried it again and again, but unfortunately, it's always the same. That's why I sold my opened old version of 100 ml on eBay. But I still have two smaller versions of 30 ml that are not quite as old. I don't know if Gucci Envy has changed anything about it at some point, but I'm not brave enough to open one of them yet. The two will definitely stay stored safely in the cupboard for now... Maybe the headache will go away someday?

If it weren't for that, this EDT is simply brilliant. But something in it just doesn't work for me, which I deeply regret...

Otherwise, it's a super beautiful, fresh, and pleasant scent; it has also lasted a very long time on me.
What wasn't so good for me at the end of the day...
But I haven't given up hope of possibly being able to use it one day..."
Envy,06/24/2009,DonVanVliet,M,287,,1,unisex? not necessarily,"I cannot agree that it qualifies as a unisex fragrance.
I would describe it as a subtle, pleasant, and unobtrusive scent.
Ideal for everyday use, I think!"
Envy,05/25/2009,SpiPs,M,3,,2,extremely green and sweet,"super perfume that you can wear every day!
it is very fresh, clean but still interesting enough.
i think it could even pass as a unisex scent."
Guilty pour Femme,09/14/2020,Laminatrix,F,78,,19,"You're not really to blame, but that's okay","In 1980, Barbara Streisand and Barry Gibb breathed into each other on disco music... somehow this scent reminds me a lot of that duet... Nice, catchy, and yet somehow mainstream - but with a certain old-fashioned basic trash factor.

With that name, you expect a knockout, but instead, a nice breeze comes along. Besides the massive misnaming, I find it okay. I smell bergamot stronger than pink pepper - I don't know mandora - in the top notes. According to my research, mandora is a rum - which fits, as it has a slightly alcoholic opening. Then in the heart notes, an illustrious round of popular floral notes comes around the corner. This time it's the powdery violet-pink floral gang that can cause headaches for some. I like the notes because they are harmless. Amber and patchouli finish it off. This makes it a bit creamier.

The scent is a solid everyday fragrance on me. Okay, nice, but nothing that hits you over the head with a fragrance club. But that's okay, as it falls into my range of ""I work here"" scents. A solid fragrance for people who don't want to exude great dominance and want something different from white flowers. Because I think that has its charm too - a bit old-fashioned, but quite charming. Somehow like Lana del Rey in a velvet jumpsuit with a Marge Simpson hairstyle. I like that because it's somehow not very sexy, a bit old-fashioned, and yet somehow original. Just like the girls in class who didn't belong to the clean girls' gang and never wanted to make a career. And that's what I like about this fragrance - because somehow this whole anti-pure and at the same time completely banal in its modernity makes the scent cool: Just like listening to old Bee Gees records, teasing your hair, and wearing velvet clothes."
Guilty pour Femme,08/24/2022,Anna1991,F,84,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,18,Witness for the Prosecution,"A friend of mine wore the original Gucci Guilty while we were on vacation together in 2014. Pleasant scent, at least that’s what I remember, nothing special, fresh, designer fragrance, beautiful bottle.

In April of this year, I received a sample of ""Guilty pour Femme"" and was quite taken with it.
At that time, I wore it for several days at home and felt completely comfortable with it.
I can’t remember the details of the original, but this one felt floral, fresh, old-school, feminine.
At first slightly sharp and cloying, it develops into a true all-rounder. Not a really old-fashioned, ""madam-like"" perfume but very floral-sweet in a powdery direction. Very nice to wear for women 30 and older.

Last week, I came across the sample of ""Guilty pour Femme"" again and wore it for a few days at work and over the weekend at the hairdresser’s. Compliments were pouring in.
And what could be better with a fragrance?
I own many perfumes that I love to wear - and yet I never get a reaction from those around me about the scent. No ""What are you wearing?"" or ""That smells so good....""
""Guilty pour Femme"" has elicited true praise in no time at all. Colleagues, hairdresser, hairdresser clients.
I had applied the fragrance heavily - 4/5 sprays.

""Guilty pour Femme"" definitely makes it onto my wish list; soon, around late summer/fall, the lavish golden bottle will be sitting on my dresser.
My summer perfumes this year were ""Jardin sur le Nil"" (super fresh-green) and my summer favorite ""Narciso Rodriguez - NARCISO Ambrée"" (warm, sensual, late summer). Both are great perfumes. But it’s slowly time for a little change.
And ""Guilty pour Femme"" is perfectly suited for that, a solid, classic-feminine scent.
Universally applicable. Now in summer and also in cooler temperatures.

When it comes to compliments, there is definitely no acquittal.

I wish you a lovely transition from summer to fall, stay healthy and optimistic!"
Guilty pour Femme,03/23/2024,DasCroe,F,96,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,EdP for all Vanilla Haters,"Complete coincidence that this one got to move in with me - I had already tested the EdT back then and, due to the penetrating vanilla in the base (I hate vanilla), it was banished to the NoNo list. Well, then I got a sample as a bonus and since everything deserves a second chance, the perfume was applied - Surprise! Another one of those candidates where the EdP and EdT noticeably differ, and one should definitely try both. Nomade EAU DE TOILETTE was also such a case (here, however, the EdT is more my style than the perfume).

I tend to find that fragrances become very sweet on my skin (so vanilla on top is a no-go), but at the same time, I really like these white/pink, powdery, slightly floral scents that remind me of luxurious body lotions. It's always a balancing act, as you don't want to smell like grandma's powder box. The balance is found here; at my delicate 40 years, I find it ""age appropriate"" - for a 20-year-old, I would probably find it a bit outdated.
Lana del Rey (quickly googled, born in '85, okay fits my 30+ assessment) as the face of the campaign is a good choice, feminine, a bit retro, sexy without being cheap - I just say eyeliner and an updo. I also somehow think of the series Mad Men.

Aside from that, whoever came up with this incredibly STUPID name - the bottle is chic and fits the fragrance direction. Guilty... why guilty? Why? For smelling good?

Speaking of smelling, the citrus top note is non-existent for me; if anything, there's a hint of pepper that adds a bit of spice to the following floral potpourri. The flowers, especially lilac/rose, remain softly creamy, no sweet scent bombs. I would have blindly guessed musk in the base, but officially, there isn't any, oh well. Altogether, very harmonious and elegant.
For the office, for me (!) it's almost a touch too sexy/feminine, as I'm not really that type, but in the evening/date, it's an ideal candidate.

Longevity is very good; regarding sillage, I'm still cautious, as I always use such creamy scents very sparingly at first, so they don't annoy me. I would rate it at least normal to initially strong. In high summer temperatures, it would definitely be too much for me, but below 20°C, it works great."
Guilty pour Femme,06/19/2024,Wolfspfote,F,16,,9,Old & New,"I have been using Gucci Guilty for a while and I am somewhat torn. I perceive it as a kind of fresh but also powdery scent. Somehow old but still new.. A fragrance that I don't smell often, which I really like. I can remember the original version, it was a bomb. This one is a bit lighter and more modern, but you can still clearly recognize the original version in the scent. The fragrance stands out but not negatively. I have actually been asked what I am wearing and I often receive compliments for my scent. What could be nicer than that with a fragrance ;)"
Guilty pour Femme,08/29/2025,LilaWolke,F,7,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Always Guilty,"I belong to the people who rarely buy a perfume more than once. Simply because I hardly ever finish my bottles. Usually, the next scent is already waiting, and the old one fades into the background...
I have repurchased Gucci Guilty EdP. More than once.

It is the scent I keep coming back to. There is nothing about this fragrance that bothers me; it is floral-creamy, and I always associate it with a confident, modern, and well-groomed woman. It is neither gourmand nor ""foodie"" or overly sweet. Perhaps that is why it is currently not in trend. For me, that’s an advantage, as I don’t smell it on every street corner. :)

Guilty EdP smells ""grown-up"" but not outdated. And it lasts FOREVER. In my hair and on clothing, I can still smell the fragrance clearly after 12 hours."

Watch My Review,"I was very excited to learn of this Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme launch and to learn it was created by the same team of Alessandro Michele and Alberto Morillas for Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Homme. Sure enough, it doesn't disappoint. Is it as good as Gucci Guilty Pour Homme? Please watch my youtube review to find out. Thank you in advance."
Guilty Absolute pour Femme,11/02/2019,Leimbacher,M,2870,,20,Raspberry-BALLERina,"After the men's version of ""Guilty Absolute"" positively surprised and even dazzled me with its dirtiness and uniqueness, I always kept this dark pink women's version in the back of my mind. I was too curious whether it would work just as well for me (or the lady by my side). This week, the raspberry projectile was then on the testing ground, meaning: on my body, and I can finally share my impressions here.

""Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme"" (the perfume names keep getting longer) reminds me of a slightly shadowy and more voluminous version of one of my favorite women's fragrances: Lalique's ""Amethyst."" And that is basically the answer to the question I posed to myself above: yes, the women's version is also really good. Even if it might not immediately find its way into my collection, I can only give it a thumbs up, recommend it (at least as a test), and praise it. Its appearance matches the scent; woody, strong, almost slightly earthy berries are rather rare in women's fragrances, and with this perfume, a woman (or perhaps even a man) can only shine and stand out. The roses may come from the lab, but they are just as juicy and sultry as the forest berries, synthetic done right, everything feels really rounded and mature. As if the current women's mainstream taste has been stripped of most of its sweetness and turned through the chypre wolf. Magnificent! If only Gucci could always operate at this level. This is great women's tennis. Nuff said.

Bottle: I really, really, really like the matching color.
Sillage: measured over the entire duration, not overwhelming or potent at all. Very wearable, as long as you don't get stuck with your finger on the sprayer.
Longevity: lasts and lasts and lasts... 9 hours at the worst.

Conclusion: for me, almost as good as the masculine version. Berry-blooming bosom friend. La Bomba with taste."
Guilty Absolute pour Femme,01/30/2019,Vindikation,M,26,HELPFUL REVIEW,19,Gucci Guilty Absolute Successful,"This is how (and will likely be) the beloved partner would like to smell.
I have really spent a long time sniffing through numerous women's fragrances, and aside from L'Instant Magic, there hasn't been much that truly blew me away.
This fragrance, however, was a complete surprise. The contrasts in scents have already been clearly demonstrated to us by Aventus. What was once the smoky birch in contrast to the fruity pineapple in the black rider - emphasis on was - is now the blackberry that increasingly gets ""wrapped"" by the rose and patchouli. Unlike many designers, there is a noticeable scent progression, just as one would wish.
Give this fragrance a chance; no man can stand those countless sweet-floral women’s perfumes anymore. With this scent DNA, you also have a unique selling point."
Guilty Absolute pour Femme,02/18/2018,Clarabella,F,40,,14,Waldiger Brombeertraum,"Beautiful, enchanting blackberry scent, with a lot of juicy-fruity, dominant, unsweet blackberry, a bit of rose, needle-like woods, and earthy, bitter patchouli.
It actually reminds me a little bit of the old Gucci No 3 in the dry down, probably due to the needle-woody, coniferous aspect with the patch.
This one is quite special. You have to love blackberries, as they are extremely present the whole time, and despite the fruit, it is not a sweet scent, despite the amber, but rather fruity-bitter.
It also slightly reminds me of the N. Rodriguez EdT.
I now have a Gucci in the house again after 20 years."
Guilty Absolute pour Femme,09/24/2018,Hazelnut,F,4,,13,Berry Strong,"Well, I quite like this unsweetened chypre fruit. The blackberry sets the tone at first, shining in full glory without a trace of sweetness. I really like that, as I generally enjoy berry notes, but many fragrances with berry notes are too sweet for me.
Guilty Absolute does it differently.
To be honest, I can hardly perceive the rose. When it is present, it is really only very subtle, with the blackberry supporting it, not dominating.
I did not expect the drydown at all at first: it becomes woody, bitter, very mature. ""Monarda"" as a note unfortunately means nothing to me, so I can't identify it. Sometimes when I sniff, I also catch a bit of ""mossy"" in my nose, almost like oak moss. It smells fine, and I got used to it quickly. Patchouli and amber do not stand out much, rather patchouli.

An interesting unsweetened, mature, bitter, ""cold"" scent that I can well imagine for autumn.
Definitely worth a test and a nice change from otherwise warm, sweet fragrances.

By the way, I do not find Guilty Absolute comparable to Lalique Amethyst at all.
The Amethyst remains very flat on my skin, smelling only of sour berries the whole time and really does not develop at all.
I find the Gucci much more successful and interesting."

What I found unpleasant and almost overwhelming the first two times, the powerful strong blackberry, developed into a more pleasant scent journey from test to test.
The fragrance is dominated the whole time by a slightly scratchy, dry blackberry, without any sweetness. Quite soon, I can perceive the Bulgarian rose, which remains subtle in the background and softens the dry, hefty berry a bit.
Gradually, earthy and warm tones develop. I also sense a slightly resinous, smoky note.
They add more depth.
Amber and patchouli take a bit longer to make their presence known. They are never intrusive here and make the overall impression warmer.
This fragrance really needs to grow. Just like the scratchy tendrils of the blackberry in the garden that wrap around everything, this fragrance also wants to grow on its wearer.
Applied in the morning, I can still perceive Guilty Absolute intensely in the evening."

Guilty Absolute pour Femme,04/09/2024,Tauriel,F,109,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,I Collect Berries in the Conifer Forest,"Guilty Absolute really surprised me, and in a positive way. Dark red, tart berries paired with a slight floral note, the ethereal scent of cypress needles, and subtle earthiness - that's how I would describe the fragrance. Initially, it reminds me a bit of Amethyst by Lalique, which I also like very much. Guilty Absolute is rather unsweetened, which I find totally great. Nothing against sweet fragrances, but they are often too overpowering and quickly become too much for me. GA stands out from the mainstream designer fragrance monotony, if I may say so. In terms of scent character, I believe it could also pass as a niche fragrance. It also undergoes a beautiful development. I always enjoy fragrances that I can connect with nature. And scents that remind me of the forest have always captivated me. They just shouldn't be too earthy, and this one isn't. The dark berry notes remain well perceivable until the end and are enveloped by the fragrant base notes. Neither the patchouli nor the amber accord are dominant or annoying. All the fragrance notes are harmoniously coordinated for my nose. Guilty Absolute has a rather cool, damp character for me. When I imagine ""my"" forest with this fragrance, it is an autumn forest in the early morning, where the botany is covered with hoarfrost and a light mist hangs in the air. I wouldn't exactly describe GA as particularly pleasing or mass-appealing. It has a distinct character. So if you're considering a purchase, definitely test it first."

The notes sounded very interesting on paper: blackberry, rose, warm woods... but on my skin, it unfolded completely differently than expected. Instead of fruity freshness and floral elegance and depth, I mainly perceive a very woody, dull note that strikes me as unpleasantly musty and reminds me of a damp room. The promised blackberries or floral component are hardly recognizable. Everything gets lost in this dark, almost dusty accord. I miss the lightness; instead, I perceive a heavy, oppressive scent profile that I personally find unpleasant. Of course, it's a matter of chemistry and taste. I can understand that some find this fragrance exciting and interesting. However, I prefer to keep my distance from it...."

Calone notes, melonal (the fruity stuff) on a plummy-milky ketones accord, a polished citral note, spices (notably cinnamon) and a sad, thin, dry, rubbery leathery note. I did the effort of picking up some notes but basically it’s just a metallic, plain and dull fragrance which smells of pure office-safe “nothingness”. Exuding bespoke elegance like a pair or supermarket socks. Bring bang Tom Ford!

Made to Measure,03/11/2014,Meggi,M,1018,,18,Ent-Hambummelung,"My wife recently said that now that I'm approaching my mid-40s, I can no longer walk around like a slob. So, I moved the suits I had previously called my ""sacks"" into (temporary - who knows how my figure will develop...) retirement in the attic and bought myself two new suits. It was an unexpected experience: a sale at the outlet of a high-end Italian manufacturer. Row upon row of suits hang on the rack. I try one on, and everything fits like it was tailor-made. The price: still in sight of the 08/15 men's outfitter's house brand, including the alterations that are undoubtedly required there.

And the moral of the story? ""Made to Measure"" is not for me!

I hope my little story could give some encouragement to those struggling with suits and perhaps even entertain a bit. I can hardly contribute more at this point. A longer comment doesn't really fit with the scent development, which is practically over after two hours. The only thing to add is that I also perceive something peppery in the opening. Furthermore, the description of the top note is missing ""absolute from a fallen asleep foot"".

Speaking of ""Made to Measure"" vs. ""off the rack"": Gucci shouldn't give up hope just yet. Somewhere out there, there might be the guy for whom MtM fits like a glove. In the meantime, I'm doing the same. Fitting, I mean.

So, that's enough for now. Wishing everyone a lovely evening!"
Made to Measure,11/04/2020,Nasenbär18,M,22,,14,Hidden Gem,"I really don't understand why this fragrance is received so poorly here while it is referred to as a ""hidden gem"" in the English-speaking world.
And I also think that Made to Measure is a little hidden gem. It smells very understated and modern, yet sweet and seductive in its heart note, which is probably due to the berry and plum notes.
The opening is somewhat peppery and fresh at the same time. The performance is also not nearly as bad as everyone claims. Here, they talk about a maximum of 1-2 hours, while the fragrance lasts around 6 hours on me.
So, anyone looking for an elegant, fresh-sweet fragrance that is very understated yet still very present has a true hidden gem with Gucci Made to Measure. Since the price has also dropped significantly, it makes this fragrance even more attractive."
Made to Measure,09/23/2013,Taurus,M,1164,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Cheap Junk Off the Rack,"I don't even know where to start!
Yes, on one hand, I had a tiny bit of hope for the latest fragrance from Gucci. It can't be that they only bottle and sell junk now.

Yes, the new bottle really looks elegant and sets high expectations. Moreover, Gucci positions ""Made to Measure"" as oriental spicy, which sounds absolutely promising.

But what is boldly marketed as a custom creation turns out to be nothing but absolutely cheap junk off the rack. Well, the first few seconds you could still tolerate it as somewhat fruity fresh. At least it smells a bit like lemon and mandarin along with some slightly sour notes.
But hardly has it been sprayed on the skin when the whole halfway decent impression vanishes like a suit made of tissue paper in a rainstorm. Even if you were to stand there naked afterward, it would still be better and more stylish than smelling like this synthetic sweaty sludge, even though it's so weak that you wonder why you would even bother to perfume yourself for so much money?
The drydown, if one can even speak of that, turns out to be dull and sour, and upon closer inspection, it reminds me of kidneys with sauce that my mother used to cook. On the plate, quite tasty; on the wrist, definitely strange.

For me, Gucci has reached the low point of a low point with this thin little water. ""Made to Measure"" is actually a case for consumer protection, as the overpromised bottle misleads buyers, and I can imagine that this patched-up synthetic material is only purchased by insecure gift buyers or pain-free fashion victims or blinded Gucci fetishists. Anyone who wants to be fooled by a misguided corporation can go ahead and buy it. For everyone else, I can only hope that they can distinguish a good tailor from a rip-off money-making scheme."
Made to Measure,08/27/2013,FLUidENTITY,M,246,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Old Parameters Recombined,"So, I'll kick things off with Gucci's new release Made to Measure. Right off the bat: the term NEW release doesn’t quite fit, but more on that later. I was as excited as a kid in a candy store for the new Gucci fragrance. I quite like Gucci's current ""contemporary"" philosophy, which is why I don't find the newer scents as bad as many others do, although it must be said that they certainly don't come close to the old heavyweights. But I think Frida Giannini is a really cool, laid-back chief designer, or as we say nowadays, ""Creative Director"".

So, let's get started. Let's begin with what we’ve known for a little while now, the bottle. The image of the vessel with the measuring water has been admired on Parfumo for a few months. Admittedly, it is absolutely presentable, but upon closer inspection, it is cobbled together from old Gucci components. The bottle itself is the same as the one used for Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme and the Sport version. The sprayer is just as tiny and powerless. You really have to press down with your finger until you realize you've sprayed something. The color is from Gucci Pour Homme II and is not necessarily ugly; on the contrary: I think it would beautifully adorn my fragrance shelf, but whether it will actually do so in reality is still questionable, as I need to convince my nose, which has already given its OK with its eyes. The lettering is from the women's fragrance Première. This thin, jagged Gucci lettering is not entirely original here either. So, visually, they've almost rummaged through the entire bottle world of Gucci, but the result is convincing. I think Gucci bottles are among the most beautiful out there.

Made to Measure comes from Gucci's fashion past, just like Première. Both are fashion lines, and both fragrances are meant to form a pair together, not in the sense that one says Pour Homme and the other Pour Femme, but rather in a more subtle way, through the fashion lines. (I don't know if it's Prèt-à-porter or Haute-Couture.)

So, what does the nose say about the whole affair? Essentially, the olfactory experience continues where the visual one left off. Even in the scent, you can identify some references to the familiar, partly genuinely Gucci, partly borrowed from elsewhere. The fragrance starts off citrusy. That’s the entrance, and what safe stepping stone has been chosen? Right, the top note of Guilty. Not quite 1 to 1, but a bit brighter, because in Guilty, the top, heart, and base notes are quickly shoved together, and I identify the amber as a scent note, adhering to Gucci's own fragrance pyramid and not the one from Parfumo here. Well, so bergamot, orange blossom, lavender. Lavender is just not really dominant here, rather, unfortunately, it’s the not scratchy (in a positive sense) rough bergamot and the orange blossom. The top note lasts longer than in Guilty, but then the amber occasionally makes an appearance. The scent development here is more prolonged than in Guilty, where it’s immediately overwhelming. Even though the amber is in the base note here, it’s the amber that brings the first light nuances. So we are currently at bergamot, orange blossom, and amber. I couldn't detect the water lily, sorry, my nose really gave it its all, but when it comes to the water lily, it was also at a loss and let its (nose) wings droop. The juniper berry, or something herbal, is not really differentiated; the juniper berry isn’t offered that distinctly, but it replaces the bergamot so that the whole affair doesn’t drift off and remains stable. Additionally, there’s nutmeg, and suddenly my Richer got totally excited. Here, MRE (in my Richer's opinion) was borrowed from some Boss ball. Immediately, my Richer drags me to the nearest Karstadt and sniffs at the gray-orange Boss Motion. And lo and behold, cinnamon and nutmeg are also in play here. The spicy-fruity aspect could come from Boss Motion. It seems to me that there’s a trend of reviving old classics that aren’t worn as often anymore, and you don’t really know what they were, to be reused as something that is incorporated into something new yet doesn’t appear entirely unfamiliar. This is also the case with Armani Code Ultimate. Armani Code + Armani Mania (I’m not straying from this theory of mine :)
In the base, there’s not really much going on anymore. Upon arriving at Boss, the fragrance slowly fades. It has become a bit heavier, which is a plus, although truly weighty is something else. So can we sniff out leather? Well, maybe just a hint, very subtle. Gucci Première? Luckily, I know patchouli differently; essentially, it just continues spicy-herbally, becoming less differentiated and less definable, and then it’s over. Longevity of the whole thing? On the skin, maybe 5-6 hours; the scent strip holds up well for me, but in the end, only something undifferentiated can be perceived.

So longevity is maybe 5 out of 10 points (Okay, with a bit of goodwill)
and projection is unfortunately only about 3 out of 10 points, truly not a sillage monster, and all of this with maybe 15 sprays.
The price is still cheeky; I believe they wanted 49 euros for the 30 ml travel spray. Well, if you have it, I’d rather save up for my Keiko Mecheri.

My theory is that this is meant to be the men's Christmas motor fragrance for Gucci; I can imagine it as an autumn scent and as a Christmas gift for hobby noses, it’s definitely okay.

All in all: A fragrance that wants to make something new from the old, without reinventing the wheel but merely shifting familiar parameters around."

They should just take a look on the internet and realize that their recent men's fragrances have been absolutely meager and at times pathetic. Made to Measure crowns it all, in my opinion. Here we are left with a lukewarm all-rounder with a fancy bottle. Not even lukewarm, this scent has nothing at all that could justify a purchase or convince testers. I hope this thing stays like lead on the shelves!

It starts citrusy and grayer than the famous mouse. Bergamot and maybe a bit of lavender. But more like an indefinable brew. Where the ingredients come from is a joke and I don't care. Your brew is lousy, Gucci. It doesn't matter whether you compare it to Axe deodorants or Creed perfumes. With a slightly cinnamon fruity touch and ending in the cheapest, light leather with an amber accompaniment. So incredibly pale, as if the perfume had a disease and was inhibited. Have I already mentioned that all of this is indefinable and mushy slush that has been smelled a thousand times cheaper in some form or another?

The bottle is great and sturdy and elegant. But unfortunately cobbled together. The sillage is that of a 3-year-old couch set and longevity under 5 hours. Do I need to say more?

I would trade 1 ml of PH or, for example, also from Envy or Rush for 100 ml of this watery stuff at any time. If given to me... I would directly re-gift it or sell it. Gucci - WAKE UP!"
Made to Measure,09/11/2017,Strandkind,M,15,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,"Masculine, unobtrusive, complex men's fragrance","I cannot understand the very weak reviews of this fragrance.
It presents itself surprisingly well to me.
It opens with a sweet, but not overwhelming, bergamot-orange bouquet, then transitions to nutmeg, stirred with a broken juniper twig and oriental plum(!) in cinnamon, and closes hours later as a comforting scent with patchouli, amber, and labdanum. I also know the latter Chypre-honey note from the wonderful Eau de Guerlain.
Well, Gucci Made to Measure is not loud and intrusive, but neither am I.
It is a reserved charming gentleman, without ever appearing boring.
And I don’t find any cheap mainstream aqua notes in this fragrance, especially since I hate those.
The shower gel and the cream aftershave are also very pleasant and help me start the day well."
Made to Measure,08/28/2013,Moriarty,M,150,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Procter gamblet mal wieder...,"…and we are supposed to be dazzled by it - by the name Gucci, the elegant bottle, and even the packaging is extraordinarily beautiful. However, the blend grenades are slowly losing their spark. Everything reads wonderfully, the appearance is maintained, but in reality, the essence leaves much to be desired.

Bergamot from Calabria, the oranges were specially flown in from Tunisia, French lavender graces the composition, the heart note is supposed to enchant with the help of Sri Lankan nutmeg and the tried-and-true plum-cinnamon combo, and the base of labdanum, patchouli, leather, and amber additionally tempts one to have positive expectations. One could at least expect a fresh, fruity, spicy leather standard. Unfortunately, it seems that some chemistry from Syria has also been mixed in, which was apparently quite cheap back then due to an oversupply - times change.

Unfortunately, it smells overly synthetic, no matter how lively the fragrance still is. In the drydown, you can already sense what has been flowery described on paper, but a hint of olfactory poison gas unfortunately lingers constantly in the background. This is not only terrible but also a cheek. No one expects high-quality synthetic fragrance materials in a cheap drugstore scent, but if you are charging a decent amount for the name Gucci, you cannot sell the same content just to be at least 400 percent more expensive.

""Made to Measure"" is an economic maximum principle, according to which one wants to achieve the greatest benefit from the name Gucci with one's own limited resources, and that is disgusting. This fragrance crime is primarily a custom-made product for personal profit, but without a fair measure and goal, because if the only quality of a perfume lies in the bottle and the packaging, something is seriously wrong, and one should be strong and resist the optical temptations."
Made to Measure,12/24/2013,Cappellusman,M,358,,8,Tailored? MASS-PRODUCED!,"I had a sample of this fragrance sent along with a perfume order to be able to join the conversation, to judge whether it really is that bad, and possibly to write a truly awful review that I had been somewhat in the mood for...

And lo and behold, all my wishes were granted! Yes, this thing is really that bad. Incredible what a brand allows itself here, which has produced an absolute classic with ""Nobile"" and then still a very good fragrance with ""Gucci PH II.""

Synthetic. Sweet. Period. 13 ingredients are supposed to be in there? LOL! She gives this fragrance to him for Christmas because the saleswoman talked her into it, so that when he gets the inevitable question in the office about what he is wearing, he doesn’t have to say Mexx, s.oliver, or Tom Tailor, but can say ""Gucci.""

This fragrance is, however, not a bit better than the scents from the aforementioned manufacturers, but three times as expensive. Unjust, divisive perhaps, but that’s how the perfume life in the mainstream has become. As long as it’s called Boss, Lacoste, Gucci, etc., even the worst and most unimaginative synthetic sludge is bought.

Women who give such things as gifts, or even men who voluntarily buy such things for themselves: MASCULINE is different, very different. You don’t even have to go into the expensive niche area. You won’t lure any dog out from behind, in front of, above, or out of the oven with that. Very dreadful, but indicative of this era regarding the perception of fragrances..."
Made to Measure,01/30/2014,FabianO,M,1008,,4,Quality bottle / scent? Inversely proportional - Shallow aquatic air number,"Again, such a flashy scent from the 2010s.
""Custom-made""?! Is THAT what Gucci understands by it today?

Ha! I have to think back a long way to find a truly creative, distinctive Gucci men's fragrance: ""Envy for men"" was one of those. Or the early ""Gucci pour homme"" line.

Here, it feels more like a large department store - nothing is custom-made, rather copied and thoughtlessly thrown together.

The first 3 minutes - as usual with today's mass fragrances - packed with stacked aromatic density, a lot of fruit, including orange and berries, behind it some artificial-aquatic tones.

After not even 5 minutes, the scent package noticeably weakens, anise, water lily, and a hint of plum shimmer through. All framed by a shallow, synthetic lab note, perhaps artificially created wannabe Asian musk?

Then it quickly goes downhill, the drydown sets in after just 20 minutes, you can sense some amber in the base, but there’s no trace of leather to be found.

Overall, very flat aromatics, not a total disaster, but also nothing to remember, let alone buy for way too much money.

Instead of designing such a flashy, massive bottle, they should have invested 100,000 euros more in a better perfumer. Here, they are very much dazzled!"

The entire fragrance is unfortunately a complete outrage, it is sticky and clings to the skin and is so fresh that you can hardly perceive it, on top of that there is this overwhelming ""scent"" of soap and an old moth bag.

The bottle unfortunately also looks rather unloved, although it is still the best part of the whole thing. The packaging is unfortunately just as cheap and comes across as gaudy.

After about 10 minutes, the scent has almost completely vanished, and this is from Gucci and at this price."
Made to Measure,11/29/2013,DaveGahan101,M,535,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Coca Cola Fragrance,"With my last order from the Central Drugstore, I received a sample of Gucci Made to Measure among other things. The bottle and packaging looked very high-quality already... and in a life before Parfumo, I used to like Gucci Guilty... does that mean I'm going to hell?;-) But after an Our Father, I should be forgiven...

In the wine world, according to Stuart Pigott, there are so-called ""Coca-Cola wines""... these are industrial products that are ""manufactured"" in tanks in large quantities... which have nothing in common with a valuable natural product and the beautiful romance of wine... they taste the same everywhere... not bad... but regardless of whether it rained, hailed, or even snowed that year, whether in Greenland or South Australia... they always taste the same... just like Coca Cola tastes the same everywhere in the world (has to taste).

Just like that, Made to Measure is a loveless and uninspired fragrance... not bad in the sense of stinky sludge, but arbitrary, interchangeable... it could be a global brand or a discount store product... that already gives a devastating verdict for any Parfumo. What could be worse for a fragrance than being described as ""generic"" and interchangeable??! I can't identify any individual notes... just something slightly sharp, herbal, and reminiscent of men's aftershave pokes my nose and smells like something I've definitely smelled a thousand times before. It's unbeatable in its boredom... it could easily start a boring club with Ultrasense and Invictus... while Invictus here almost smells like a second Jubilation in comparison. Because Invictus doesn't even try to smell like an adult and valuable perfume but shamelessly shows that it is ""full of emptiness"" and makes 16-year-olds happy.

Here, they try to appear elegant on the outside... and Made to Measure never succeeds in that. No wonder no perfumer is mentioned above... maybe there wasn't one...;-) or it's just self-protection. Anyway, for those who aren't really into perfumes, and whose mommy still lays out their clothes for vocational school or the first year of apprenticeship in the morning, they can safely buy Made to Measure, then they get a solid, below-average perfume (also suitable for the office) and it looks a bit cooler than the Axe spray on the bathroom shelf if a woman should happen to wander into the apartment... just make sure to take off the Uli Stein or Walt Disney socks and the Christmas-themed tie first... and clear away the Diddl mugs from the night before... then maybe it will work out with the neighbor;-).

So, if you like a mega discreet bore, want to avoid any fragrance compliments (from women) at all costs... and are sitting in a single office anyway, you should buy Made to Measure... although 60 euros for something like this... hahahaha... add another 20 euros and the (good) world of perfume opens up to you..."
Made to Measure,05/25/2024,PriorityPete,M,2,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,A Loyal Companion,"When I received Gucci Made to Measure as a gift from a good friend over 10 years ago, I never thought this fragrance would remain my absolute favorite for so long. It has accompanied me through many years and countless memories, always with its unmistakable charm.

Gucci Made to Measure is a versatile fragrance that can be worn year-round. Whether it's summer or winter, it always fits and adds a pleasant, fresh note. The scent opens with an interesting combination of bergamot, lavender, and anise, rounded off by spicy notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. The heart of the fragrance, dominated by plum and water lily, gives it a floral and slightly sweet nuance, while the base notes of leather, amber, and patchouli add a warm, masculine depth.

Unfortunately, I must admit that the longevity of Made to Measure is not the best. After about 6-7 hours, the scent noticeably fades, especially if one does not spray generously. Yet, despite this small weakness, the fragrance has always been well-received. Friends and colleagues have often commented on it and given compliments, which has confirmed my choice.

Even though Made to Measure receives rather average ratings here on Parfumo, it has been and remains a special fragrance for me. It is not the loudest or most striking scent, but that is exactly what makes it so pleasant and versatile for everyday use."
Gucci Première,09/10/2012,Gold,F,726,,6,Première is not a Première,"Just another generic floriental in a posh, golden bottle.
Honestly, I find it more and more difficult to tell these fragrances apart.
Is it Guess? Or Armani? Lady One Million Eau de toilette or Eau de Parfum? Or the latest Gucci like in this case? This said, it is a totally average, fairly unobtrusive scent - nothing to here to justify the name ""PREMIERE"". It is neither sexy nor vuluptous. I can't find any leather in it and the woody base is totally unpleasant and synthetic in a bad way. Judging from the poor quality of the ingredients used, this one should be avoided, you could be wearing something much more original for the same price."

To my nose it doesn't smell anything what is claimed. No champagne, no white flowers, no leather. At least not as I know them through my own experience. I smell a very big purple raspberry ""fruit"" cooked into a jam with a lot of sweet white musk (somehow the image similar to what I get from The Body Shop Raspberry line). It's very dense and sticky and suffocating to me. But definitely give it a try it if you like the modern fruity-musky tendency (I smell it a lot in Celebrity scents). In that genre it's pretty good - rounded, has a good volume and free from unpleasant aberrations. But only if you like fruity jams."

Gucci Première,04/07/2018,QuercusAlbus,M,72,,2,Break on Through to the Other Side,"I have been revisiting many fragrances recently that I have neglected for a long time. I am finding the exercise wonderfully successful - more so than I dared hope! I think I have been ^very^ constructively coached in the meantime. And with this particular one it is not even a case of finding much new in it, but more of ^refinding^ what I perceived in the first place.

I found something a little curious about this when I first tried it. I noticed that the reviews here are not very favourable to it. But I like the °tune° that this fragrance playeth! I'm not sure that I can argue that it is a ^great^ composition, but it ^does^ have a tune that I happen to like rather a lot.

I find the fruity sweetness of it buffered - which is to say, held back from becoming cloying - by a very subtle tobaccoleafy sort of note. And certainly °sort of°, as I find that I ^begin^ to perceive a tobaccoleafy note - but then it is not ^quite^ that, but something really quite unique to this fragrance, and that teases me a great deal, and in a very pleasant way, with my wondering how to define it!

Perhaps it is the note that is listed here as 'woods', or the 'leather' one. Or maybe this rather curious note÷accord÷quality has been °rendered° into notes-list-speak by these idiomata as mere conveniences, as I agree with a previous reviewer that it does not have anything that shows ^patently^ as wood or leather; but it ^does^ have that curious quasi-tobaccoleaf °quality° that I have been here describing.

... a few hours later ...
To be perfectly honest, I am sympathising more with the reviewers who are somewhat scathing of this, on the basis of having actually been wearing it all this time since I last put anything here. I mean ... it's a bit sort of, well, dead! It really isn't a very °sanguine° perfume, this one. It's, sort of, a bit of a °flat beer° sort of thing, IYKWIM. Feel like saying to to it ""come on! get up! ^do^ something!"". I think the people who have been scathing of it probably well-know what I am talking about. Yet, at the same time, I'm not retracting what I said in favour of it. I don't know whether it ^could have^ been made better in the respect just cited without compromising the interesting & positively distinguishing qualities described above: maybe it ^has to be^ a bit °unsanguine° in order to have those qualities - I don't know. But it has it's uses. I can quite easily forsee occasions when I'll use it quite happily.

In connection with what I said about having rehabilitated or reinstated fragrances I have long-neglected, I would like to raise the following point - not so much to sidetrack duscussion about fragrances into discussion about mysticism, but to get worked-out between us what can be done when we find that we have fragrances that we now despise and scourge ourselves for having °wasted° minlet on.

There's an item of ancient wisdom that can be found in various places - ancient Chinese, Freemasonic, all kinds of mysticism - to the effect that when you learn ^anything^ - anything ^at all^ - you go through essentially three phases: first the initial joy & enthusiasm; then the grind, as the disciplines become irksome; then the consolidation of those disciplines, and a return to the original joy - but a joy this time °exalted° by the change in oneself imparted by the installation of a body of learning in oneself. 'Breaking through to the other side', I think one could call it. And I think it is so, whether it's a skill one has learned, appreciation of an artform (including a perfume) or whatever.

When I first started using fragrances I was wowed by all fragrances; then I learned to become critical, and had crisis after crisis as I °learned° disappointment; now, I think I am °breaking through to the other side°, and I am getting back to something like being wowed by all of them - something like, but actually better!"
Gucci Première,09/02/2012,Turandot,F,839,,25,Can they really do that??,"The name of the new Gucci perfume doesn't really show much imagination. I'm curious to see if Chanel will just accept this.

So here it is, the scent that Gucci hopes will boost their Christmas sales this year. The pyramid reads quite modestly, and since Gucci fragrances have never really excited me, at least the newer ones, my expectations weren't too high.

I was pleasantly surprised by the top note - which seems to develop in the wrong order, because the first thing I notice with astonishment is the leather. A fine wild leather note that made me curious for more. But - no such luck - the leather note fades away within a few minutes, leaving behind a generic and interchangeable scent from the remaining notes that we know all too well. The orange blossom holds back more graciously than, for example, in Elie Saab or Burberry Body, and since there are no fruity notes to further emphasize the mediocrity, a very delicate, floral-woody perfume remains, which is discreet in both sillage and longevity. That's a pity, because I actually quite like the base, where the fine leathery note reappears.

The bottle with the stirrup is already familiar to us from Gucci fragrances, and the golden, or rather gilded, presentation suggests something precious. Now, Gucci Premiere will surely play its role in the Christmas business, but I would doubt whether Gucci really needed this scent. In any case, Gucci Premiere is not extraordinary."

I just had to have something, and so it became Gucci Première. However, I do not regret this at all, as the frustration purchase was worth it for me. Gucci Première is a great, sensual scent.

Gucci Première,02/29/2016,ElysaShades,F,148,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,The Missed Theme,"I must admit that I have a bit of a contentious relationship with Gucci. I have 6 fragrances from this house at home, and they all impress with their very short longevity. However, this could be due to my skin chemistry, as the scent holds up perfectly on clothing.

Now to Premiere... I agree with the majority of my predecessors. A premiere is not something you experience every day, so a fragrance with the same name should be something special. Something opulent for the evening. Something that stands out and takes people's breath away (in a positive sense). So, anything but this Gucci scent.

It starts off quite sweetly with bergamot and orange blossom. But much lighter than, for example, Code Femme by Armani. (There, the orange blossom is more present and heavier). After about 20 minutes, it becomes increasingly floral. Not bad, but relatively unspectacular. What bothers me, however, is this leather/musk note. I can't help but feel that it clashes with the floral abundance. It feels a bit like wearing two perfumes at the same time that don't really go together. Really a shame, because you can already tell that it is something high-quality. No disturbing alcoholic or cheap synthetic undertone. Just... as if someone had mixed the fragrance essences and didn't come up with anything decent. Really a shame for a rather high-priced brand like Gucci.

If you still like the scent, it is more suitable for everyday wear. Wearable at any time of day, from young to old. It simply lacks any profile, any recognizability (aside from the leather scent that bothers me here). Really a shame and truly unworthy of a luxury brand like Gucci."

Gucci Première,01/13/2013,Parfumfan29,F,302,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,0,What is special about Gucci?,"Well, I have now tested several perfumes from Gucci, own some, and have had a few. This scent here definitely does not carry the ""signature"" of some Gucci classics like Gucci Rush, Gucci Accenti, Gucci Eau de Parfum, Gucci Envy. I find Premiere lacks anything special, no recognizability like the aforementioned classics. It's a shame that Accenti is no longer available.. These perfumes had something special, a note/aura that bears no resemblance to other perfumes. But that is just my feeling. I would describe Premiere as an average scent, where one would not guess that it is a Gucci perfume!. The entire fragrance bouquet feels familiar to me, like I’ve smelled it somewhere before. The top note is still quite pleasant, bergamot and orange blossom are rather fresh-floral here, but after a short time, it takes on a rather harsh musk touch, and I also perceive something fruity. Here, the AHA-WOW effect is completely absent for me. Sorry if I put it this way. This scent can be worn well in the evening, as it becomes a bit heavier in the base note, and in the cold season! The positive aspect here is at least the longevity."
Gucci Première,09/05/2012,StellaMaris,F,69,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Rodriguez for Boring People,"I have to agree with Turandot - exciting is something else! This scent is simply one thing: ""nice"". You can hardly say more about it. I can't really detect a great development in the fragrance here; rather, ""Premiere"" is for me a rather appetizing orange cuddle musk mix. It reminds me, as the title suggests, very much of Narciso Rodriguez edT, just in the well-behaved variant. This is a decent clean musk, creamy and somehow ""motherly"". It simply smells like a well-groomed mommy after showering. But do I want to smell like that? Please, no.
As I said, this is not a bad fragrance. I find the orange-musk combo balanced and lovely, but a bit more wood and leather would have been nice. Unfortunately, the whole thing smells quite trivial, and the longevity doesn't convince me, just like with many other Guccis."
Gucci Première,03/18/2019,Smokeycherry,F,34,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Delicate Fragrance,"This scent simply reminds me of Italy. Not only because I wore this perfume on a trip to Venice, Verona, and Lake Garda, but also because this fragrance radiates the elegance and femininity that I associate with an Italian woman.

I love that the leather note is so prominent in this fragrance, as it harmonizes very well with the floral notes of the white flowers. However, I also detect quite dominant pepper notes, and I am really surprised that pink pepper is not listed here. In terms of intensity, I find the perfume quite good; there are days when I feel the need to reapply during the day, but there are also days when the strength is completely sufficient for me. Overall, I would describe the scent as delicate yet present. In my opinion, it is not a “quiet mouse,” but it is also not a show-off.

I think it’s great for days when you are dressing elegantly, as I envision a lightly tanned woman in a white shirt, dark-wash jeans, light brown ballerinas, and a matching handbag with simple gold jewelry. But in my opinion, it can just as well be worn on days when you are casually heading to the city for coffee in a dress."
Gucci Première,04/09/2014,NadsSpatz,F,596,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,An Oscar for Us Women,"~ Inspiration ~
I became aware of the perfume through the advertisement featuring Blake Lively. She embodies the epitome of a young, beautiful, successful woman in Hollywood.

~ Bottle ~
Like with ""Gucci,"" the square shape has been retained. Also, as a small accessory, there is the medal with stirrup. The shiny gold color stands out here, which is meant to evoke film premieres and the associated Oscar ceremonies.

~ Scent ~
The top note starts with bergamot and sweet orange blossoms. White flowers and a hint of musk join in. The warm base is formed by various woods and leather, which can be perceived well from the beginning.

~ Longevity ~
On my skin, it lasts about 5 hours (on clothing and hair a bit longer). 1-2 sprays are sufficient, as the scent is intense but not overpowering.

~ Occasion ~
I find it most suitable in autumn/winter or on cooler days in spring. Whether for successful businesswomen in the office or for an evening out - it leaves an elegant, self-assured impression.

~ Conclusion ~
Like its predecessor ""Gucci,"" it is quite well done, but I can't (yet) fully identify with it."
Gucci Première,09/18/2012,Bejibi,F,3,,8,One word...,"To describe this fragrance, one word is enough: Boring.

Smelled a thousand times, nothing new, no innovation.
What a shame, the bottle looks beautiful.
Gucci no longer convinces me with its new fragrances (-> Flora Garden Collection *yawn*)...

I hope they come up with something new soon, because the old fragrances were great (Rush, Gucci1&2, Gucci by Gucci,...).

As my predecessor already mentioned, the scent remains the same until the end, nothing changes at all and the longevity can also be rated as weak."
Gucci Première,03/04/2013,Markyta,F,86,,6,Gäääääääääääääähn!!!!!!,"Actually, there isn't much to say about this little water beyond the title. A nice citrus top note, but the heart and base do nothing for you, nor do they do anything against you. It's all been smelled a thousand times over or something similar - boredom is the name of the game."
Gucci Première,03/13/2015,Fraublond,F,8,,3,"Not a going-out scent, but quite good for everyday use","Premiere was a gift I received. After about 8 weeks, I had used it up (50 ml) because I found it quite good for work, unobtrusive yet elegant; clean, clear, subtle. I think it made me come across as likable. Nothing more. No one ever asked me what it was. So it remained very close to the skin. I will not repurchase it. Too much money for too little surprise. If I want an office scent, I can just go to the drugstore."
Gucci Première,02/15/2013,UnicornCoco,F,374,,7,"A Walking Fragrance, Like a Stroll on the Red Carpet","It starts, as expected, citrusy, but quickly the citrus boredom transforms into a cozy ""Ohh."" A note emerges that is incredibly noble, yet for me, unidentifiable.
As I leave the shopping mall, the scent changes in an interesting way, becoming almost resinous.
But this note quickly disappears, and it becomes sweet and soft, smelling like a lightly vanilla orange candy.
This fragrance lingers for a while until distinct woods join in, making it slightly powdery.
And after three-quarters of an hour, I can actually smell leather!
Oranges, woods, leather, and a sweetness remain, making this fragrance very intriguing.

If a walk on the red carpet, like at a premiere, were to be represented by this fragrance, it has succeeded very well in my mind.
First, she gets ready at home, a citrusy shower, then a short, resinous ride in the limousine to the event, followed by the walk on the carpet, where she showcases her orange candy side until she reaches the attractive man in brown leather boots and links arms with him.
Gucci, I like you."
Gucci Première,06/14/2014,Roveena,F,123,,5,Indefinable and Dismissive,"Aside from an unpleasant sting in the nose, this fragrance left me completely indifferent. I can't even say what it actually smells like; it simply has no warmth for me and seems more suited to keeping people at a distance. It was a gift from someone who clearly doesn't know me well enough, as this perfume doesn't suit me at all. My association with this scent: A woman around sixty with blue hair, horn-rimmed glasses, a tweed suit, and an exceptionally bad mood, who is just rejecting a job applicant because he hasn't shaved properly..."
Gucci Première,12/16/2015,Blix,F,43,,2,Not everything that glitters is gold,"It's difficult; this scent does not evoke any particular emotions in me. And yet, the sense of smell is the one that most strongly influences feelings and the subconscious. It neither brings me joy, well-being, enjoyment, nor even the opposite, such as aversion.
I only know that the fragrance seems quite trivial and interchangeable. Essentially, it is a perfect perfume for a colleague who always applies just a bit too much of a good thing. This way, you have a rather exclusive room fragrance as a side effect.
A brief start with the top notes, which spray orange blossoms and bergamot, quickly followed by musk, white flowers, and as a background panorama, the woods in a leather coat.
While I occasionally sniff at myself, the scent becomes too much for me, and I no longer want to smell it.
And as mentioned in many of the previous comments, the fragrance tends to develop more into a perfume for the more mature generation.
However, there is nothing to criticize about the bottle. I find it beautifully designed in its golden dress, with its noble angular shapes, and as a highlight, the trademark of Gucci, the broken bridle."
Nobile,01/26/2013,Drseid,M,828,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,A Monster Fougere...,"Nobile opens with an aromatic blend of bergamot citrus and lavender with a lime-like tarragon and rosemary herbal undertone. As Nobile enters the heart phase of its development, the early bergamot citrus recedes but the aromatic herb-laced lavender remains, coupling with a tremendous oakmoss note rising from the base joining balsam fir as co-stars with an additional rose and carnation floral supporting duo joining the lavender. In the late heart, the aromatic lavender slowly dissipates but the oakmoss and fir still remain through the dry-down now in support, as a relatively dry amber and non-smoky vetiver duo takes the fore to finish off the scent's development. Projection and longevity are both excellent, with the scent lasting 10-12 hours on skin.

Nobile is one of those rare aromatic fougere scents from the past that just can't be released today due to oakmoss restrictions. The very green herb-laced oakmoss and fir combo with floral support is absolutely captivating and dominates for most of Nobile's key development before turning to resinous amber late during the dry-down. The official note list is very long and quite frankly I am sure I missed a whole bunch of them, but Nobile just smells great, plain and simple. It unfortunately commands a price just as high as how good it smells nowadays due to its discontinuance long ago and the scarcity of remaining bottles on the after-market. That said, those looking for a reference aromatic fougere should look no further than this 4 to 4.5 star out of 5 classic by Gucci."
Nobile,12/21/2020,Nwhite,M,31,,2,Gucci Nobile,"If you are a fan of vintage Polo Green, you will really dig Nobile by Gucci. The dry mossy / patchouli accord is very smooth, masculine and mature. Overall, the scent is fairly ""quiet"" compared to other aromatic fougere's from the 80's as the blend is exceptional.

A 30ml bottle can be found for around $100-$150 and is entirely worth every penny for this vintage discontinued gem of a fragrance.

4 stars"
Nobile,07/27/2023,Indominable,M,23,,2,The essence of 1980’s mens colognes.,"I remember the commercials when this came out. I liked the bottle so much when I saw it, I bought it without even testing it out. In a years time or so, it was gone and I forgot about it. Flash forward to 2001, I find a huge lot of Gucci Nobile products at an estate sale. I snatched it all up. Body wash and sprays, soap on a rope, deodorants, shaving cream and splash too. I absolutely adore this scent, it is the quintessential man’s cologne. A suddenly sharp but clean barbershop medicinal smell, it soon turns sweet and much gentler. Afterwards there’s this incredibly deep woods smell, sort of wet and smooth. There’s still nothing else quite like it. It’s amazing. 20+ years later and I have half of a 120ml bottle left and a 30ml bottle. If Gucci brought this back today, it’d probably sell very well. I just don’t think they’d get it quite right again."
Nobile,01/21/2024,Ojavierm,M,2,,1,Unforgettable scent,"I haven’t have this one since the nineties, but I know I’d recognize it instantly if I’d be around someone wearing it. It’s just unforgettable. I even dare to think that this is the best juice I’ve ever had. One still can get it nowadays online supposedly from vintage collectors but at exorbitant prices.
If I were forced to throw away all my collection and be required to decide to keep one I’ll certainly struggle between Nobile and Chanel allure home sport eau extreme."
Nobile,05/14/2025,GDawg,M,43,,1,"It should be called ""F*%king Fantastic""!","Sometimes I find fougères nauseating, when the aldehyde component overpowers all else … But with Nobile, the fougère smell is toned down, smoother, and well-balanced. It’s complimentary to the spicy and sophisticated heart notes, giving them a clean pop without being overwhelming. Because at its heart, this is mostly a spicy and sophisticated green scent. Nothing smells quite like it. It's also a versatile scent - I can see it working in any season, day or night, even as a signature scent. Projection and longevity was moderate, about what you'd expect from an eau de toilette.

If you like fougéres, you'll probably love this. And if you hate fougéres, you might like this despite yourself. For comparison, my ratings of fougéres goes like this:

Gucci Nobile - 9.5
Drakkar Noir - 7.5
Azzaro pour homme - 5.5
Paco Rabanne pour homme - 4.0

It's a discontinued fragrance. And only place you can seem to find it now is eBay, where prices are expensive by any measure. Initially I thought I would just wear my sample until gone and then say goodbye, due to the cost. But it grew on me and grew on me - I’ved raised my ranking of it on here four times! Now I just love it and it’s my favorite overall fragrance. By the time I bought my full bottle, I didn’t mind paying at all."

Nobile,11/09/2014,FabianO,M,1008,,11,"Classic, Fresh-Green Italian Original","Another gem from the 80s.

""Nobile"" has a wonderfully old-fashioned style and is qualitatively incomparable to anything from the current Gucci offerings.

A freshly crafted, already green-spiced opening. Lemon alongside a hint of tarragon, a bit more rosemary, grounding lavender.

The heart is thoroughly green, framed by a touch of jasmine and subtle fir.
The overall style remains fresh with a spicy undertone, somewhat reminiscent of ""Armani Eau pour homme"".

Softly ambered, yet in the dry down a bit woodier, mossier, lightly musky-spicy.
A truly well-made Italian classic from the now vast category of ""Strong fragrances that ignorant manufacturers have completely senselessly discontinued""."

Nobile,01/30/2014,Scorpio,M,118,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,When Gucci Still Produced Quality,"If you look at Gucci's recent fragrances, you quickly realize that the company has thrown itself into the mainstream in this regard. Flankers galore, thick cheeks with nothing but hot air inside (Made to Measure, please) and those that really had something to offer were ruthlessly stamped out. I still mourn Envy to this day.

I had never heard of Nobile until recently. That might also be because the bottles of the first Gucci fragrances were simply atrocious, and back then, I was all about aesthetics. Shame on me! But honestly, the new ones aren't winning any awards either.

Nobile is a true Italian. Not an immature ragazzino. An elegant, educated guy. Macho? Hmm, I honestly struggle with that comparison. He simply has too much style. I don't know why, but I kept thinking of Guido Brunetti from the Donna Leon novels. Unfortunately, also Vice-Questore Giuseppe Patta. Nobile manages to combine herbal notes with a wonderful freshness. What smells harsh and ethereal in Jil Sander Man III has been skillfully rounded and made elite here, fresh and radiant. Absolutely suitable for everyday wear. Which is hard to believe given the intense ingredients.

Something remarkable happened to me with this fragrance. I was lost in thought when suddenly a wave of a wonderful scent hit my nose. Wow, I thought, who smells so great here? Until I realized, it's ME!

But what good is all this? He has disappeared from the scene. However, you can still secure him as a mini for little money as a tip. I didn't even pay € 3.00 for my two untouched 5ml bottles. For the big guys, of course, prices are being asked that make you shake your head."

Masculine, without being macho. Multi-layered and complex, without being exhausting. You truly can't expect much more. The quintessence of perfumery art from the 80s.

What good does it do to mourn this gem? It will NEVER be reissued. One should acquire the remaining minis on the market at reasonable prices (the few remaining full bottles are, of course, absurdly expensive, as is usual with such fragrances) and enjoy them. I still own two minis that won't last much longer, and therefore I will go hunting with the relevant suppliers once more before the rest of this treasure is finally gone..."

Nobile,09/03/2013,Leimbacher,M,2870,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,From a Long-Forgotten Gucci Land,"My second miniature bottle and absolutely not a flop, I am firmly convinced of that, even though I didn’t know the scent beforehand. Anyone who has the large version at home should guard it like their own eye. Because this is a true gold treasure from a long-gone, golden Gucci era.

The name fits like a glove, and for me, it plays in a classic league alongside Pour Monsieur or Eau Sauvage from Chanel. Only with Chanel do they take care of their treasures (aside from forced reformulations!) and they are still available everywhere. This one has been allowed to die, even though it could have been THE classic of the Gucci house. Because Gucci doesn’t really have a true classic from the 70s or 80s. At least none that is still available for purchase. Another blemish on the brand, which weighs even heavier for me than the botching of all new releases for years! I’m curious about Made to Measure; it’s supposed to be horrendously bad and dull again!

As for the scent: A perfume for the old-school gentleman in a tuxedo. Mixed with a powerhouse 80s fragrance that is almost bursting with distinctive energy, chest hair, and thousands of ingredients.

It starts classically, with a spicy bergamot. Then the scent becomes greener and rougher, with enormous power and a tailored presence. Fir, rose. Everything is truly green and foresty-mossy. However, it’s just mild enough that it never causes a wrinkled nose. A mild gentleman-macho with a cane and chest hair peeking out from the wreck. Sounds funny, but it’s a seriously good scent! A fragrance that I could well imagine wearing as a signature scent in 10-15 years. But unfortunately, that’s not going to happen! The scent concludes with a gentle, even slightly sweet moss-wood-vetiver base, just to my taste!

The bottle is noble, simple, and classic - as the name suggests. The scent lasted a nice 7-8 hours on my wrist, and the sillage was boss-level, as our youth would probably say.

The are rather soft and I would suppose I have acquired a taste for a stronger, more robust perfume that can take me away, one that will grab me by the shoulders and shake me. Granted, there is no horrible alcohol whizz at first hint, just a soft hint of something to come. Maybe peach. Maybe vanilla. So we have generic fruity-gourmand blended into a soft cream sitting low, so low that I must put my nose into it and therein lies the problem. The patchouli is so weak I don't know it's there. Another common scent packaged oh-so-prettily, rather vampy to catch the eye of unsuspecting wallets, a designer name for those that care enough about labels, pretty packaging and the money shall be spent on commonality."

Guilty Black,01/08/2019,DieRiecherin,F,3,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Not bad,"Obviously, this is a flanker of the original 'Gucci - Guilty'.
Gucci as a clothing brand is currently being celebrated by the youth, and fortunately, the fragrances are less 'mainstream' than one might think; I hardly catch a whiff of anyone wearing a Gucci scent in the streets and alleys. Perhaps it’s just my city.
I definitely find the bottle successful; it looks very mysterious and promising. I love the combination of black and red; it makes a statement, while the smaller 30 ml version looks even more compact.
Now, onto the actual scent:
It smells similar to the original, I think. A bit fresher, possibly due to the fruits. The opening smells slightly synthetic, but fortunately, it almost completely disappears for me. The sillage is also close to the original. By no means a bad scent.
For those who prefer something unobtrusive yet a bit different, I recommend buying it. It fits in pretty much any situation, from job interviews, evening galas, swimming pool visits, to everyday work life. It also has a 'cool' aspect; it's not just a pure summer/spring scent, very pleasant."

But unfortunately, the scent is so interchangeable. I tested it with great anticipation and was then disappointed. Immediately, I had two thoughts in my head:
1. Smells not very different from the ""normal"" Guilty
2. Reminds me of Ode l Amour by Yves Rocher, which I used very often in my youth.

Now, it must be said that Ode l Amour by Yves Rocher is not at all ""Black."" Just like Guilty Black is a bit too shallow for me.
It fades quickly, has a poor sillage, and simply lacks that certain something. I smell fabric softener, rose, and maybe a few woody notes. However, I understand ""Black"" to mean something different."

Guilty Black,12/17/2013,Leimbacher,M,2870,,4,Robin's Belt Buckle,"Well, normally I try to create many connections to the scents in the titles, sometimes informative, sometimes funny. But with Gucci Guilty Black, I simply can't come up with a title that relates to the scent itself - it's just too trivial. Therefore, the next paragraph, which usually focuses solely on the fragrance, will be all the more difficult to write. Only the bottle really reminds one of Batman & Robin.

The scent is sweet, fruity, and quite bright. The addition of Black is once again completely out of place. Red berries meet a bright hint of pepper. Then there's a not really identifiable floral note, and in the background, a synthetic amber that lingers the longest. Acceptable for younger girls without fragrance experience, but even here, the €50 would be much better spent elsewhere. You just need to browse a bit on Parfumo and develop some taste.

Bottle: kitschy, cheap, but eye-catching.
Sillage: despite the flashy scent, surprisingly calm.
Longevity: 7 hours.

A bit better than the men's counterpart, but still far behind any expectations one might have. This is neither Black nor Gucci for me. At most, guilty, and that for lack of creativity and yawning boredom."
Guilty Black,11/01/2020,PolinaSh,F,7,,4,Expensive,"That's really all you need to know about this scent. It is expensive, it smells expensive, and it makes a noble impression.

Without smelling it for long, you can already notice the fruits at play. The scent is very sweet, overly sweet, so it's better to wear it in winter.

This is a fragrance of modern times. It reminds me of nothing from the past, but the image comes to mind:
The woman wants to storm into a hotel with her lover so they can have a bit of peace and relaxation. Both have money and their hands full of bags... Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci...
and afterward in the room, the two had beautiful sex.

For such occasions, the scent is perfect, as it is very sexy and expensive. In any case, in summer, this scent would be too much.

The fragrance is nothing special, but it smells good and expensive. If you don't want to stand out too much but still want to make a corresponding impression, this is the best perfume."
Guilty Black,11/26/2014,NadsSpatz,F,596,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,The Dark (K)Night,"~ Inspiration ~
I already like ""Guilty"" very much. While browsing, I also came across ""Guilty Black"" and hoped for a stronger evening version of my beloved daytime fragrance.

~ Bottle ~
In keeping with the name, the bottle is designed in black instead of gold. The glass in the middle with the intertwined G's is red. (I immediately thought of Batman) Admittedly, I always thought this was the men's version...

~ Scent ~
You can immediately tell that it's a ""Guilty""!
It starts off with juicy, red fruits and a hint of pink pepper, before blooming lilac and violet reveal its well-known floral heart (raspberries and peach continue to provide a sparkling, fruity vibe in the background). Patchouli and amber give it a warm side in the base.

~ Longevity ~
On my skin, it lasts about 6 hours (a bit longer on clothing and hair). 2-3 sprays are enough, as it is not overpowering but still quite intense.

~ Occasion ~
A bit heavier than ""Gucci Guilty,"" it fits well into the mild evenings of spring and autumn. As a going-out fragrance, it feels too ""proper"" for me and too floral for winter.

~ Conclusion ~
A little darker, but otherwise no big difference from ""Guilty."""

Guilty Black,04/06/2013,UnicornCoco,F,374,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Wonderful,"Since I really like Gucci Guilty, I was quite excited about the Black version and I was not disappointed; it smells simply enchanting! However, I must admit that it doesn't smell very different from the original, which is not surprising since the notes are quite similar.
It starts sweet, soft, and floral, smelling of raspberry and peach. Then comes a very interesting note that I can't identify; it smells almost like a mix of chocolate and incense. Quite extraordinary and wonderful.
I find the black design inappropriate, as the scent reminds me more of a fragrant, pleasant summer day than anything dark.
However, the fragrance could be a bit stronger; unfortunately, it is almost disappearing on the skin."
Guilty Black,03/04/2013,SteffiK,F,0,,3,nothing special,"I tried it out today in a store and it's nothing great. I even think that it's just a copy of various other black scents. They all smell similar or have amber and patchouli as a base, just enhanced with a few other ingredients.
They could have certainly done more with it."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,04/16/2012,Freakyricky,F,10,,8,Soooo Sweet....,"I received Gardenia by Gucci (unfortunately) as a gift from my brother, as he worked on the new Garden campaign for Gucci.

At first, I was of course very, very excited. The packaging, the design, and ultimately the bottle are truly beautiful. So pretty that the scent would visually fit very nicely in my bathroom shelf.
Unfortunately, it is just too sweet for me. Personally, I prefer fresh, light fragrances.
Gardenia is not that. Maybe at the very beginning, just for a brief moment (pear, berries)... then it is very, very sweet for a long time, and many hours later, and this is the only thing I personally like about the scent, it becomes powdery on the skin. However, before it reaches this state, it gives me headaches.
In itself, Gardenia is certainly a nice, rounded fragrance if you like sweet scents. It fits well for spring and summer, but perhaps also on cooler days for snuggling under a cozy blanket.
Somehow, I perceive it as a typical, sugary sweet girl’s fragrance... unfortunately not for me.
It somewhat reminds me of Pure by Jil Sander. (which is also too sweet for me personally)"
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,04/28/2015,Marienkäfer,F,3,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,Love at First Scent,"Now I have to champion this wonderfully beautiful fragrance! Since I first tested it, it hasn't let me go; I love it from the first spray to the last soft whisper.
When I first smelled it on my arm, I immediately thought - this is it, exactly what I have been searching for so long, even though I had imagined it quite differently.
At first, it is sweet-fruity, which I find totally delicious when sprayed on, but I wouldn't actually want to smell like this all day. Yet in that first moment, it smells so wonderfully of summer holidays, cycling home from a day at the pool or to the park, hair still damp and tied up, just a shirt over the bikini and long free weeks ahead.
Then the fragrance becomes softer, less sweet and floral, and the notes blend beautifully. It is the twilight of this lovely summer day. But it is just beginning, and the air is still warm, but not oppressive.
Then it slowly and quietly fades away, yet sometimes my nose still catches a hint of that summer evening.
I could smell it forever, and no other fragrance has transported me to another time like this. Thank you, Gardenia!"
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,08/21/2018,Leimbacher,M,2870,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Wasp Attack Predestined!,"""Flora Gorgeous Gardenia"" is a sugary little flower of the finer sort. More like frosted Frangipani than Gardenia, but still great. Fruity, sweet, feminine, youthful, spontaneous, naive, summery... these are adjectives that come to mind with this pink Gucci.

Easy to wear for young women who know how to playfully seduce. Although tailored to mass taste, it is never intrusive or sticky, never pushy or loud. Wasps and other critters are definitely attracted to it, especially this hot summer. Of course, it's different, but I can somehow handle it here. A creeping playmate, a monotonous spring awakening. The lady of the world from Rio to Berlin can hardly go wrong with this from 16 to 24. Because it surely attracts not only stinging flying insects...

Bottle: beautiful color, nice design. With a bow.
Sillage: fortunately not too heavy... that would have been deadly this summer. Not just for those with wasp allergies...
Longevity: 6 hours is longer than expected

Conclusion: sweet, tender, summery - a fine flower that lacks a bit of uniqueness. Nevertheless: worth a try!"
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia,12/17/2014,NadsSpatz,F,596,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Sugared Frangipani instead of Magnificent Gardenias,"~ Inspiration ~
So far, I have tested the regular ""Flora"" and ""Glamorous Magnolia"" from the Gucci ""Flora Garden"" line and was now curious about ""Gorgeous Gardenia"".

~ Bottle ~
The hexagonal shape indicates that this is a version of ""Gucci Flora"". It also features a thin black ribbon around the neck. The liquid in a delicate rose tone promises a subtle, floral scent. The name ""Gorgeous Gardenia"" means ""Magnificent Gardenias"".

~ Fragrance ~
It starts fruity-fresh with crisp green pears and tart red berries. The powerful floral heart of white gardenias and frangipani gives it a sweet yet slightly sultry aura, rounded off with brown sugar and patchouli in the base.

~ Longevity ~
On my skin, it lasts about 7 hours (on clothing and hair even longer). 2-3 sprays are sufficient, as it is quite intense and otherwise comes off too synthetic and overloaded. The sillage is unobtrusive but noticeable.

~ Occasion ~
A lush floral scent for the warmer days and evenings in spring, summer, and autumn.

~ Conclusion ~
You can recognize the typical ""Flora"" character of the perfume. It has a bit of ""Oh Lola!"" by Marc Jacobs."

I expect a lovely wildflower meadow that one carefully walks through barefoot to avoid bending the stems.

However, the quite
floral scent is accompanied by a harsh soapy note that doesn't quite match my expectations.
Alongside fruity and floral elements, the clean soap keeps peeking through.
Is the gardenia responsible for this cleanliness factor?
Thus, the lovely wildflower meadow loses its romance.
I can't perceive any sweetness - the scent remains floral but harsh for me.
Somehow unbalanced.

Guilty Cologne pour Homme,03/20/2019,Hecutsa,M,2,,2,Gucci A++,"Wow! This fragrance is actually really good! Definitely not what I was expecting but I'm happy about that. Very modern and not your average designer spring/summer fragrance. Where most are all citrus and aquatic, This cologne is floral and woodsy. This one really reminds me of Dior Homme, but not in smell rather in genre. The more floral, soapy and woodsy with be a nice change and make you standout from all the other heavy citrus and aquatics this summer. Like Dior Homme this one opens with a pungent almost medical citrus smell, I'm assuming from the bergamot but that dissipates in seconds and the florals takeover. The Heliotrope is centerstage in the fragrance and again like Dior Homme gives a really nice soapy/powdery scent with a little little spice from the rosemary I'm guessing. From there the scent remains this soft clean floral with a warm base and the scent stays this way for most of the duration until maybe around the 4 hour mark and then the woods and patchouli completely takes over and finish off the night. And honestly the woods is really what made me a fan of this fragrance. The warm cypress with the patchouli gives this a animalic, balsamic aroma that almost comes off as a cleaner more musky Oud. This fragrance is label a cologne but the opening is pretty wide and comes off more like a edt but once it dries down it becomes very soft which I'm sure others will confuse the performance with being weak but I think this is a A+ fragrance from the house of Gucci and another one of those fragrances pushing the boundaries and starting conversation of what men fragrance can be just like Gucci Guilty Absolute, this one belongs in my collection."
Guilty Cologne pour Homme,06/17/2020,Golcher,M,139,,1,it'll grow on you if you give it the chance,"I get why this fragrance is polarizing, it's certainly not a crowd pleaser and in fact I felt a little disappointed after the first wear. I did enjoy the opening when I tested it at the store, I didn't love but I liked it and it was on sale so I went for it. First actual wear started fine, very nice opening but the dry down not so much but the damage was done and I wouldn't just leave in the back of the closet, at least I'd wear it when I stay home but after 2nd wear I paid closer attention and by the 3rd it became almost a love.

Yes, Guilty Cologne is challenging to some extend, it does have a gorgeous opening and then it turns into a baby wipe kinda smell that can be off putting at first but it's different from your average freshies and blues. The baby wipe vibe is not an actual bad thing, it does smell clean and fresh and longevity is actually real good (7hrs plus).

Overall it's a nice fragrance that falls a little bit short to become a 'love' but it is a strong 'like'"
Guilty Cologne pour Homme,11/18/2020,Basti87,M,1062,,22,Underrated,"Gucci was never really my brand. Neither the overpriced clothes nor the fragrance creations. I haven't tested many from this brand, but the pyramids and concepts don't appeal to me much, and the ones I tested I found rather mediocre. I couldn't test the very popular discontinued fragrances anymore.
I tested this one about a year ago during a shopping spree. Why this one? This beautiful green smiled at me so nicely, and the word Cologne is something you always need. Just like all the L'eau, Fresh, Sport, and whatever else they are called.

During my first test, I wasn't exactly blown away, but it was a pleasant scent for everyday wear that I roughly noted down. Especially when I saw the prices for this shop online, it made its way onto my wish list. I think the prices are so low because it hasn't received much attention and the sales figures are pretty much in the basement. Especially with a discount code, you can get this for free. 50ml costs under 30 euros in many shops, and 150ml is already available for just over 50 euros. More than fair compared to other fresh scents.
Anyone expecting a typical Cologne-style fragrance will be disappointed. It is also not a typical Morillas scent, where most have a similar touch. With Guilty Absolute, he was already very creative, and here with the Cologne as well.
As I said: Anyone expecting a refreshing Cologne will be disappointed. You get a scent that resembles Nivea cream. Not exactly the same smell, but it definitely goes in that direction. Those who like moisturizing creams like Nivea might find this appealing. You are accompanied by very soft, well-groomed, and also very pleasantly creamy notes. The cypress note is rather gentle compared to other cypress scents. Overall, one shouldn't pay too much attention to the pyramid, as this creation has its very own touch.
Performance is fantastic for an EdT in the supposed Cologne concept. Projection is very, very good over long distances, and the longevity should be close to double digits. Well done.

Overall, a great bargain that can be worn very well in everyday life."
Guilty Cologne pour Homme,07/05/2020,Parma,M,277,,22,"Original, Fresh Green Gummy Candy","I already like the original. So I like this one too. Drawing on the Guilty DNA (gummy candy), this Cologne (in EdT concentration) surprises with its own, unusual freshness character. Very modern, very appealing, but away from all the potent Ambrox and aroma-chemical wood paths.

For me, it’s a mix of green Ahoi-Brause (without the fizz), Fanta Lime, green gummy candy, shower gel, and sweet mint drink. A penetrating, herb-fresh coolness with a subtle watery quality on a sweet gummy candy base. In green. Everything perfectly balanced. It has a light, well-groomed soapy note and develops a very gentle woodiness that keeps it from becoming too “funky-funky.”

Compared to the original, it comes without lavender, which gives the predecessor that hinted classic touch. Its “depth” is also not reached, although there is enough volume present without deploying “heavy” notes. The designation ‘Cologne’ somewhat misleads, as it is actually an Eau de Toilette. This is reflected in the sillage (especially in the first hour) and remarkable longevity (10 hrs.+ with good perceivability on my skin).

I find the scent to be a very fitting complement to the original for warm days. While the original leans towards the seductive direction, this one remains refreshing and sporty-sexy. Personally, it is a tad too modern for regular wear and a bit too sweet for a fresh scent, as it lacks the “established” traces of the original, yet it seems to me a touch more refined. It does not have the initially slightly scratchy synthetic quality (directly on the skin, not in the projection) and blends into a round, compact mass. It is also linear, but interesting and - another parallel - understated enough not to be intrusive or become tiresome.

I really enjoy it. It radiates an incredible amount of optimism, simplicity, and zest for life, and is thus characteristic, as well as in other areas (independence, understatement, blending), of a typical Morillas Freshie, in my view. Here in good mainstream quality. By the way, the aforementioned Fanta feeling was even more prominently continued in the CK Everyone released a year later, there in the classic orange variant. Open up and enjoy!"
Guilty Cologne pour Homme,03/11/2019,Leimbacher,M,2870,,20,Definitely not a bore!,"This flanker has nothing to do with its brothers. Nowadays, flankers can be completely new scents. This should be clear to everyone by now. But how does it smell, the new Gucci for men for the warmer days? Does the path continue in the right direction after the bold ""Guilty Absolute""? In my opinion: oh yes! But with many asterisks...

Many people will not like ""Guilty Cologne"" at all. And some will like it even more. I think I belong to the latter group... It is a scent with guts. Especially when you write the word Cologne in capital letters. A bitter-floral men's fragrance in light. Very woody, very special, totally different and new. Admirable! It has something of one of the lighter versions of Givenchy's ""Pi"" crossed with ""Fleur du Male"" and some completely innovative approaches. You have to get used to it. Blind buy recommendations look different. But it stands out so much from the crowd, dares to be different, and thinks outside the box that I find it pretty awesome. Sometimes cacophony, sometimes a stroke of genius. But I definitely lean toward the latter. Violet polarizer. So if you want to explore new paths this summer and don’t want to smell like your ten sidekicks, you have to at least test it. My prediction: cult hit!

Bottle: beautiful, a visual highlight, no wonder it's highly anticipated.
Sillage: due to its uniqueness, it stands out. Sometimes positively. But not always... it’s not really loud, though.
Longevity: only 4 hours, which I find pleasant.

Conclusion: bold, different, ballsy. Gucci is making a statement. I like it. It polarizes and is a very special cologne. Between yuck and wow. But as I said: better than the same old nonsense. Marzipan meets juniper berry. Ice kisses bitterness. Lightning brushes coolness. Those who don’t dare..."

Guilty Cologne pour Homme,03/30/2021,ParfumDude,M,11,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,"""Young one, apply your cream well, the sun is shining!""","Here it is again, the rare case where I simply cannot understand why there is so much negative criticism directed at a fragrance. Did I get a good batch? Or do I smell some things differently due to a genetic defect compared to most others? Joking aside, at the end of the day, everyone has their own taste, and mine tells me: Guilty Cologne I like you!

The fragrance comes in a bottle that I find quite successful; I also really liked the one from Guilty Absolute. I just find it elegant and high-quality, even if the cap comes off a bit plastic-like. The juice shines in a light mint green, which, as it turns out, fits well with the fragrance itself.

It starts off aromatic and slightly creamy, totally reminding me of creams like Nivea and Penaten. I can understand that this association may not resonate well with everyone, but to me, it feels somehow calming and clean. For me, light white floral notes are also prominent in the opening, which steer the fragrance in a classic Italian barbershop direction, but not so much that it feels outdated. After the opening, slightly more aromatic and herbaceous nuances join the fragrance; I particularly find the juniper-cypress-rosemary combo really successful, which gives the perfume a slight herbiness. However, the Nivea cream accord remains at the center, which, for me, defines the DNA of the fragrance. I find it surprising that despite the Cologne designation, the fragrance practically avoids the classic Cologne citrus in my nose and fully focuses on its aromatic-fresh creaminess.

In my opinion, Morillas has created a really good fragrance here, which stands out from my image of a classic Cologne due to its Nivea cream DNA while still being suitable for similar occasions. I simply associate the fragrance with sunshine and Dolce Vita tranquility, making it perfect for spring and summer. The longevity and sillage are not outstanding, but in my view, they fit the discussed seasons. Let’s just hope that Gucci dares to experiment a bit more in the spirit of Guilty Cologne and Guilty Absolute, both of which polarize but, aside from the fact that I think they are both great, at least break the mainstream designer fragrance cliché a little and try new paths.

Thanks for reading and see you soon :-)"
Guilty Cologne pour Homme,02/20/2022,Philipp91,M,219,,4,"Citrusy, Creamy, Sun","Guilty Cologne is a wonderful EdT. Designed for summer, it showcases its strengths during this season. It is citrusy, fruity, creamy, fresh, and minimally herbal.

The fruity freshness comes from the bergamot, juniper berry, and rosemary. The creamy note is created by the high-quality smelling (white) musk. Cypress, patchouli, and cedar round off the fragrance and give it a very slight woodiness. The scent reminds me a lot of the Narciso Rodriguez Bleu for Him fragrances. They also have a beautifully balanced freshness, fruitiness, woodiness, and above all, creaminess. I really enjoy this interplay.

Guilty Cologne is not an EdC but an EdT, and it has solid performance: unlike the original Guilty, it lasts 5 to 6 hours with good projection in the first 3 hours. Especially on warm skin or in warm temperatures, it performs great! In general, you can wear this fragrance for any occasion without annoying anyone, and you simply smell clean and as if freshly moisturized. I can really recommend giving it a try."
Guilty Cologne pour Homme,05/06/2020,DonFredjo,M,4,,5,Can it be something different?,"I acquired this fragrance because I was drawn to the color and the bottle.

Envy Me,01/18/2012,Missk,F,1357,,2,I'm not envious,"This is the second time I've tried this scent, and to put it nicely, I really dislike Envy Me.

In my opinion, it doesn't smell like something I'd imagine Gucci producing. It smells quite cheap and sour. It is in no way original and it's something I'd expect to find in a cheap drugstore, not listed under a famous brandname with an expensive price tag.

The strong opening of pineapple, peony, mango and pink pepper put me right off. These notes never seem to blend well, and in general I'm not usually a fan of pineapple in perfumes to start with.

I was hoping that the heart would be much more pleasant and interesting, but unfortunately the pomegranate and green tea took over and faded out a lot of the softer more delicate notes like the jasmine, rose and musk.

During the drydown I began to smell some improvement, however by that stage I'd already decided that Envy Me wasn't my cup of tea.

For people that honestly enjoy fruity scents, this could be for you. If I had to pick fragrances that I found similar to Envy Me I'd say, Paris Hilton and Baby Doll by YSL."

I was actually drawn to ""Envy Me"" by Gucci solely because of its pink design. During a swap, I received a sample to test.

~ Bottle ~
The elongated glass bottle is adorned with a pink mesh pattern of Gucci emblems, which looks like a net to me. The name ""Envy Me"" translates to ""Envy Me"".

~ Scent ~
Upon application, it unfortunately has a somewhat synthetic, piercing quality, but it is also very floral and fresh right away. Pineapple, lychee, and pomegranate provide a tart fruitiness. Its intensely floral character comes from lush peonies, water jasmine, and pipe vine. The base notes consist of musk, white tea, sandalwood, and teak wood.

~ Longevity ~
On my skin, it lasts about 5-6 hours (a bit longer on clothing and hair). 1-2 sprays are enough for me (even though it’s only an EDT), otherwise it becomes too cloying and scratchy.

~ Occasion ~
A fresh, floral-soapy scent for the mild and warmer days and evenings in spring and summer (when applied subtly, it’s also suitable for the office).

~ Conclusion ~
Due to the pink packaging, I expected a sweeter scent. Overall, it feels too ""green"" for me. Those who enjoy so-called flower meadow scents should definitely give this one a try :)"

Then a very delicate citrus scent emerges, which to me smells like oranges and a touch of vanilla. But when I look at the fragrance notes, it seems to be more about pomegranate and sandalwood.

I find the scent somewhat disappointing; over time it becomes increasingly citrusy and thus too ordinary.
After a little while, it shifts slightly towards a soapy scent, which in this case makes the perfume better.
It is still not something to be envied."

Sometimes it’s funny that when searching for a fragrance or a pair of pants, you end up coming home with something completely different .. well, what can I say. 2005, the scent on my skin and in the shopping bag on my wrist, you practically walked into me… my summer love 2005 …
Just as I must have smelled in that moment, you and the whole world smelled too, namely:
Floral, zesty, sweet, slightly peppery… just like our days began and evenings ended …

I will never forget this spring/summer love with you and Gucci Envy Me

In that moment in 2005, many must have envied me, and not just for this wonderful fragrance …"
Envy Me,02/09/2011,Maroni,F,30,,0,so boring!,"unfortunately, it doesn't come across as fresh and zesty as I would have expected from the ingredients.
the end result is rather dull.
I can easily imagine it on older women, but personally, I felt too young for it, and it's also not a scent that stands out. With envy me, it's certainly rare for someone to say, ""oh, you smell great, what is that?"""
Gucci Eau de Parfum II,01/26/2012,Missk,F,1357,,3,Delightfully pink fruity floral,"This seems to be a very popular fragrance, and while I understand its appeal, I guess I expected something more.

Gucci eau de Parfum II appears to be the perfect Summer choice for the young and extremely feminine. This is your typical pink fruity floral, inoffensive and pleasant.

The opening of Gucci eau de Parfum II is actually quite strong, with the berries and citrus coming to the fore early in the composition. The florals, although present, hardly feature in this fragrance. The fruit certainly dominates.

The heart softens a little into a shampoo-like concoction that is both clean and delicate. Once again it is that 'straight out of the shower' type smell that is replicated here.

The drydown is by far my favourite part, with a musky and subtle berry scent creating a direct comparison to berry flavoured yoghurt. I thoroughly enjoyed this sudden creaminess and I found it to round off the scent nicely.

Although fruity fragrances aren't really my thing, I rather like its 'cuteness', I have to say that this is quite delicious. I'll also add that I found no problem with the lasting power, it lasts considerably well on me."
Gucci Eau de Parfum II,08/27/2017,pudelbonzo,F,2405,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,14,rose without Rose,"When I saw the rose-colored box at Karstadt, I immediately headed towards it, as I expected a rich rose scent.

However, I can't detect a rose in this friendly fragrance.

But that doesn't matter, as it exudes elegance paired with joy of life even without this proud flower.

The pink liquid rather points to the delicious blackberry, which is framed by bright jasmine.
A delicate bitterness is added by violet leaf and cedar wood - yet the scent remains cheerful.
The mandarin provides a transparent impression - and sandalwood is soft and creamy.

Gucci II has a certain ""everyday chic"" - and here subtle elegance and lightness go hand in hand.

Perhaps even combined with a dose of ""carefreeness"" that one sometimes needs in life."

But aside from that: the first impression is a (almost too) sweet, endearing fruitiness. The only conceivable color for this scent is indeed pink.
The top note transitions seamlessly into the heart note. The base is a soft, warm whisper.

The longevity is more like an Eau de Toilette, and the sillage is very modest.

That's it, wave, wave, Gucci II..."

When I spray a bit of the perfume on my skin and take a sniff, I first notice something fruity. The mandarin and orange are the most prominent scents. After a few minutes, the fragrance changes on my skin. It is no longer as clear and fruity, but has transformed into something floral. Violet, jasmine, and blackberries emerge here...."

The bottle IS definitely big and powerful, and I find it very, very beautiful! Unfortunately, only the bottle; the content is not so ""powerful,"" rather fleeting ;-)

After spraying, I am enveloped by a really strong, fruity note. Definitely red berries and massive orange. Contrary to the pyramid, I still smell penetrating, fresh raspberry. These notes remain constant; I do not detect jasmine! The top note does not differ at all from the heart note.
The red berries are a bit too strong for my nose; fortunately, the longevity of this scent leaves much to be desired! The base is hardly recognizable after about an hour... What a pity!

The fragrance smells really beautifully fruity and fresh. I mostly smell the blackberries and black currants. It is truly different from the other perfumes I own.

Gucci Eau de Parfum II,04/18/2025,Minigolf,F,2512,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Like a fine parade cushion...,"....this is how this ""berry scent"" smells. Who still remembers those beautifully embroidered cushions for the sofa or the once-modern wicker chairs from decades ago?
Floral motifs in rich colors... here we have violets, blue heliotrope, and jasmine. Fruits were also popular for such embroidery. Dark blue blackberries, a bunch of black currants, along with sunny oranges. This creates a beautiful picture and tasteful impressions.
When the cushion fabric is light wood-colored - like cedar and sandalwood - the motifs stand out even more wonderfully. And it is particularly the slightly dominant sweet-bitter fruits that make this parade cushion something special. I really like this ""parade cushion scent,"" as it is somewhat ""old-fashioned"" yet somehow timeless.
To my nose, it's a bit sweet - but still pleasant to sniff :-))"

Out of boredom, I finally tested it, something without rose, lily of the valley, vanilla, or musk. Great. :)
So, I like it more and more. I find it refreshingly light and delicately floral, just slightly sweet like a delicate ice cream. An ideal summer fragrance! Unobtrusive but charmingly beautiful! Well done, Gucci! :)

P.S.: The color matches the scent, subtle and lightly pink!!"
Gucci Eau de Parfum II,12/30/2009,Kittycat,F,280,,2,Understatement,"Gucci II is an extraordinary fragrance that conveys understatement. Subtle and fresh; the top note: very fruity (orange, mandarin, currant), top and base note: woody-spicy (cedar wood!) - it is extremely wearable in all situations.
With this scent, a woman simply smells good."
Gucci Eau de Parfum II,10/23/2010,Yggie,F,3,,2,Big but... wow?,"I have the Eau de Parfum II here in the 50ml size for a short time, and I must say, what struck me negatively right away was the, in my opinion, huge bottle.
It really doesn't sit well in the hand and is quite bulky due to its square shape.

But that shouldn't bother me too much, because what is inside the heavy bottle convinced me more.

Right after spraying, I think of fruits, a basket full of forest berries. A citrus note is also clearly recognizable, and even now, you can distinctly sense the spiciness in the base note.
After a while, the flowers become more prominent, but not as strongly as the spice of the base note.

I like the scent itself; it's not a fragrance that immediately reminds me of 50 twins, and yet it is unobtrusive, making it versatile for everyday use.
However, for special occasions or going out in the evening, it would be too 'nice' and pleasing for me."
Bloom Nettare di Fiori,11/19/2023,ScentStudio,F,156,,1,Not the right audience...,"Listen... I... I'm honestly finding reviews that are over one and a half year old!
I've been buying new samples, doing collections, trying to create a harmonious feed and some fragrances are left behind. Left in the dust!

Bloom Nettare di Fiori has long been sold, I don't have it anymore, so bear that in mind reading the review.
To my surprise, I was yet again lucky and was #gifted two new fragrances. I was allowed to choose freely and even though I should be grateful, I found myself in a difficult situation. The scents I could choose from were almost all florals. You know how I feel about those. I sniffed and sniffed until I got a piercing headache, but ended up choosing Sí eau de parfume and Nettare di Fiori.

Nettare di Fiori is a pure floral fragrance, so you might wonder how I ended up choosing it, but my explanation is quite simple. Nettare di Fiori didn't have any notes that bothered me. It is a lighthearted floral fragrance of white florals, a delicate sweetness and a unassuming elegance. I cannot imagine anyone disliking it with a passion. After dry down on paper, the florals become more nuanced.

On skin, the fragrance is quite nice, not my usual type, but it isn't as bad as I have found designer fragrances to be. Floral, a little nauseating, not too sweet though. After dry down, the scent becomes musky and a little deeper. Powdery from the osmanthus and a little dirty from the patchouli. It has a funny balance of being elegantly mature, but at the same time sweetly juvenile.

I was hopeful, but true to my taste and nature, this floral isn't for me either."
Bloom Nettare di Fiori,07/06/2020,Ninamuse,F,5,,14,No Happy End,"Oh, still uncommented?

My father brought me a sample of this fragrance, and of course, it was immediately tried on my skin. I am not familiar with the other Blooms, so I cannot make a comparison.

I can immediately describe the top note as bright and radiant, likely thanks to the ginger and rose. The combination is quite refreshing, and I feel invigorated. A lovely first impression!

After the radiant start, a soft, rounded tuberose approaches me, wrapping itself around my arm and will not let go for half a day (on clothing, it probably lasts even better!). I am truly not a fan of tuberose, but here it is in harmony with the other two notes (which I can hardly detect) neither too piercing nor too gum-like, but so pleasant and softly floral that I let it be and even have to sniff my arm more often: Yes - I am thrilled, really beautiful! For me, it is the perfect balance between transparent, bright clarity (thanks to the ginger?) and the soft creaminess of this versatile flower. Occasionally, I catch a whiff of my own scent trail and am pleasantly surprised each time by how pleasant, fresh, and well-groomed it smells. A bit vintage, yet somehow in a modern, fresh way.

After about four hours, the tuberose is slowly enveloped in musk, which gives it more softness and depth. Unfortunately, an unpleasant spiciness comes into play for me - I suspect osmanthus here (maybe patchouli is its accomplice?). Because from the radiant, soft flower, it turns into a spicy-creamy-floral mishmash that collapses in on itself and no longer pleases... What a pity, it all started so beautifully?!

Great start, beautiful middle, but unfortunately no happy-end drydown for me. If it weren't for that, this Bloom with its bright, radiant, elegant aura and its modern vintage vibe would be a great office and year-round fragrance."
Bloom Nettare di Fiori,09/04/2021,Spektrum,F,113,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,beautiful,"Today I sniffed my way through the Gucci Blooms, and this one surprised me among the others with its comparatively fine restraint. I had to spray again, get closer with my nose, but what a heavenly scent! Plant-based green but not as cool as Acqua di Fiori. Floral, yet layered (the Ambrosia, on the other hand, smells exclusively of tuberose absolute to me). Lush, slightly sultry, with a light nourishing sweetness (like nectar, or plants you can eat). Still, you are not overwhelmed, nor is anyone around you.
An uplifting, invigorating feel-good fragrance, sensual, without being ""perfumey"".
Exactly my thing, this little work of art."
Bloom Nettare di Fiori,11/23/2022,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,11,Fragrance with Hummingbird,"Today I just wanted to sniff around at Karstadt in the perfume section, and my husband accompanied me.
A nice gesture from him, as he is a good advisor when it comes to fragrances.
I wanted to let Gucci Blooms pass through my nose and my mind - but not buy it.
But then he kindly offered me Bloom Nettare Fiori, as his eagle eyes had not missed the reduced label.
He has a good selective perception in this regard.
Unfortunately, there was no tester available.

But I always create my own images for the titles - and in my image, I saw a colorful, shimmering hummingbird sticking its beak into an exotic flower to sip the nectar.
That was enough of a buying argument for me.

And at home, with the first spray, the light colorful little bird actually fluttered around me.
Enchanting tuberose rises to my nose, accompanied by soft rose and slightly sharp ginger.
A gentle honey note softens the ginger.
Bright jasmine joins in - and noble osmanthus.
Nettare has an elegant tendency that remains ethereal - and speaks of romance.

A multifaceted, shimmering fragrance - fitting for my hummingbird fantasy."
Bloom Nettare di Fiori,12/07/2024,Xkxraj,F,5,,2,A Bouquet of Colorful Roses,"For lovers of floral scents, Gucci Bloom Nettare di Fiori is just the right choice. Characterized by rose in the top note, followed by fresh jasmine bud in the heart note and accompanied by patchouli in the base note, this fragrance is truly wonderful!
For me, it is an evolution of the classic Gucci Bloom. It is the perfect companion for warm summer days, whether during the day for the office or in the afternoon for a stroll in the city. Anyone who likes roses should definitely try this fragrance."
Bloom Nettare di Fiori,11/10/2025,Dewflower,F,2,,1,Bouquet with a Disturbance,"Currently, I am testing quite a few fragrances, and today it was this one.

In the top note, I mainly smell the rose; I can barely detect the ginger at all. Right after that comes the tuberose, and puuuuh, it is quite strong. In combination with the musk, it gives the fragrance a rather heavy character.

But something is bothering me in the background… a glance at the pyramid made everything clear to me - patchouli. It haunts me. My nose seems to react quite sensitively to it. In every perfume I have tested so far, the patchouli stands out as an unwelcome musty disturbance.

The fragrance is still not bad - but in my opinion, it is also not particularly good. It reminds me more of a scent that older ladies like to wear. The patchouli is for me the final knockout criterion."
Guilty Parfum pour Homme,03/03/2024,Smeriglio,M,72,,1,Guilty of not being good,"What a smell!!!! Considering the price, my opinion gets even worse. It starts with a bit of all three notes listed in the pyramid, none stands out above the others, all are hinted at and do not stand out due to naturalness or other. Subsequently, in the central part an amber accord (sweet enough to be unisex) is increasingly prominent, which already peeked out behind the opening notes from the beginning. It reminded me of certain versions of Playboy. There's a hint of wood coming through in the finish, but it's still the ambroxan that dominates. For the record, orange blossom, nutmeg, Spanish cistus and patchouly are absolutely not noticeable"

Method : 3x spray on arm or wrist, two different times

This is a pissed off review. This perfume is like a girl that makes you fall for her and even impresses you over the course of 2 or 3 dates, gets your hopes up, and then drops the bomb that she's married.

I fell in love with this scent (NOT the EDP, NOT the EDT, NOT the Elixir, NOT the Essence...THIS one) at first spray. Guns in both arms, blazing away. CHOOM CHOOM. Double barrel, baby. Then I saw the price. A little disheartened, I searched online. I was ready to pull the trigger on a 6.7oz whopper but I figured I should go back and test it on my skin first.

Scent on my skin was, as on the tester, fantastic. It blew me away. Smells like newly shampooed floor mats in a car along with fresh leather. It smells like you're buying a new car and makes you feel that way too. Or, you had your favorite car completely detailed. Very svelte, very smooth, very bougee.

It stays that way and projects 2"" off the skin for the first lap. Zero complaints. Then it fades to an intimate smell around 50 minutes, nearly having to touch the nub of your nose to your hand to get the same strength. I'd be fine with this if it stayed at that strength for another 4 hours, but no, at exactly 2 hours, it fades like a forgotten memory. Sure, even up to hour #3 I can put my nostrils right up and honk my skin to get a scent but even then it's a desperate grab.

I went back today and experienced the same sad longevity.

This might be a worthy purchase in the big bottle if you can get it on sale, and be willing to re-spray every 2 hours. The scent is THAT good. But it is horribly lacking in performance. I am convinced that at retail, this is one of the worst values on the market.

Before you fall in love, test its longevity first - this is an exciting fling, not a marriage."
Guilty Parfum pour Homme,01/12/2024,Thatbwoy,M,100,,1,A safe compromise,"There I was sat on some hard unforgiving grass. Sat in little to no shade in some random girl parent’s garden, while she struggled to get Lenny Kravitz ‘Let Love Rule’ to play out of some small speakers from her Walkman all the while trying to be cool and nonchalant. At the same time flirting, laughing at all the witty and sardonic quips. Happy hair tossing, all doe eyes and searching questions.

I’m sat bored, awkward, annoyed and ignored. None of this performance was for me. I’m just an accessory.

I’m just sat there waiting for my brother to notice this 90s middle class ingénue and throw the poor girl the attention she’s struggling to get.

I don’t really know if this moment actually happened. I don’t know if it’s part of a lost summer or part of a dream. A shit dream. I don’t really know if I can trust my recollection as there’s factors that deceive and elements that appear as fact.

That is the long winded way of saying that though this iteration of the Guilty fragrance line is pleasant; I can’t trust any part of my experience of it as though parts of it are fine and nice they’re at the same time tediously familiar and banal.

I think this is a good fragrance but it’s not got anything about it that makes me think that there’s a story behind it. It’s creativity via marketing and margins. Ultimately it’s just a thing that is there without any fanfare or deeper presence - I bet when it was launched there was little relief or anxiety about its potential or performance. Just a sniff, and on to the next one.

Also this brings up the image of a white late 80s-early 90s convertible Mercedes E-class. No reason why…maybe that girl’s mum owned one."
Guilty Parfum pour Homme,03/04/2024,Ms17,M,3,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,The Perfect Business Scent,"Serious, fresh, masculine, pleasant. That's how I would describe this fragrance.
My absolute go-to scent when I want to smell fresh at an event, not intrusive but still present and high-quality/interesting.

Among the initially somewhat (!) citrusy, green-woody scent, a very light sweetness gradually mixes in.
Subtly masculine and, in contrast to other ""fresh"" perfumes, a bit heavier and not unpleasantly lemony like so many others.

Longevity is good; it is still noticeable in the evening. I would rate the projection as OK.

I can only agree with a statement here: I've never smelled anything comparable - a clear recommendation for anyone who needs a serious scent in their collection that doesn't come off like every other citrus/shower gel fragrance."
Guilty Parfum pour Homme,11/01/2024,Marius9513,M,8,HELPFUL REVIEW,7,Pleasant Scent in Incredibly Beautiful Bottle,"The Gucci Guilty pour Homme is a fragrance that is fundamentally solid and nothing more.
I first smelled it in a perfume shop around the corner from me. It was a time when I was looking for a solid designer fragrance that isn't worn by everyone at the Sauvage EAU DE PARFUM level and is well-known. When I came across Gucci Guilty, I first had to get an overview of which version appealed to me the most. When I encountered the bottle of Guilty for the first time, I was blown away by its beauty. I don't know what it is, but I love this bottle. The fragrance I want to discuss in more detail has a typical designer characteristic.
Right! It is pleasing. Since I started wearing Gucci Guilty, I've been receiving compliments. Not because the scent is extremely good or has a mega sillage, no no. You simply smell pleasantly good and well-groomed with it, without being intrusive. The fragrance notes blend well together. Personally, I perceive the Italian lemon the strongest, but not in a sour form. Paired with the dry woods in the base, it feels much earthier and slightly sweet, like sweetened lemon tea.
Feel free to let me know if I could help you with this review. Have a nice day."

Guilty Intense pour Homme,08/18/2024,Missk,F,1357,,2,An Improvement on the Original Gucci Guilty,"I honestly did not enjoy the original Gucci Guilty pour Homme. I found it a little too sour and strong, at which point I warned my boyfriend to never buy a bottle of it for so long as we were together.

I approached this Intense flanker with an air of trepidation. My fingers were crossed behind my back, and my painkillers close by just in case. Thankfully this is a far better fragrance than the original. It's strong, but nowhere near as overwhelming as Gucci Guilty pour Homme.

It's a slightly more improved composition. The lemon and orange blossom accords are less sharp, and the lavender appears to be much smoother. Amber has also been added to this flanker, along with a masculine and spicy coriander note.

I hope this fragrance isn't a limited edition. I'll most likely scream if they discontinue this and keep the sharp, messy Guilty pour Homme on the shelves.

Don't let the 'intense' fool you, as it is not as bold or overpowering as you might expect it to be. The sillage is strong, however it won't knock you out. It's still a pleasant and wearable fragrance. It has my tick of approval.

Original review written: November 2012."
Guilty Intense pour Homme,07/16/2025,Shiron212,M,20,,1,An interesting twist,"This is Guilty pour Homme EAU DE TOILETTE with an ambery and chocolatey patchouli base.
I wouldn't call it totally generic, but it's been done before, it's sort of in the style of the original formulation of Black XS EAU DE TOILETTE - it's a pretty good twist on the Guilty DNA overall.

All year-round and every occasion (maybe not the dressiest, because it can come across as playful), has great longevity (I could clearly smell it after 7-8 hours) and the projection is moderate to heavy for about 2 hours.

Just like most discontinued fragrances, it's not worth the inflated price, but if you can find it for the original retail price or under, it might be worth a shot."
Guilty Intense pour Homme,10/01/2012,Leimbacher,M,2870,,4,Reformulate 3 more times and maybe it will be in a good range,"After last week’s test where Gucci Guilty performed very poorly, yesterday it was Guilty Intense’s turn, which I had heard much better things about than the original... and it is better, but still far from good, still Gucci and unworthy of the price.

It is a mediocre autumn/winter scent, very gourmand and much sweeter and thicker than the original, which is the right direction. It reminds me somewhat of Joop’s Splash, which also combines freshness with strong sweetness/gourmand... but even here, I don’t like it well enough to buy or recommend it. Lemon & orange are nice, but mixed with the freshness somehow robbed of their essence. Fresh food is delicious, and food by the sea can be great, but food already half in the sea? No, not really^^

In this price range, there are far better alternatives and scents for the cold days, even if the bottle, sillage, and longevity are decent to very decent. It’s a shame that Gucci Pour Homme 1 is hardly available in Germany anymore; then I could compare quality with mediocrity well... I hope Gucci gets back on the right track!"
Guilty Intense pour Homme,11/27/2011,Taurus,M,1164,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,No Chance of Acquittal,"That the brand Gucci, which once really brought appealing fragrances to the market, is sinking deeper into the abyss is nothing new. Perhaps the sales figures and the design of the bottles are right, but the content gets worse with each scent.

So it is with a bad premonition regarding the Guilty pour Homme offshoot Intense. I have no idea what is supposed to be intense here; apparently, they have mixed in intense amounts of powdered sugar, because this nasty powdery sweetness is unfortunately no longer a minor offense.

There is no trace of a citrusy opening, as the top and heart notes might suggest. After a few minutes, the base note arrives with a botched patchouli-wood-amber-vanilla mishmash that quickly evaporates uninspired until the end.

They could just as well have poured the content into a pink bottle. Perhaps the same is even in the female version - I wouldn’t be surprised.
For a drugstore scent under 10 €, I wouldn’t say anything, but for a Gucci product, I find it quite cheeky.

In any case, I am suing Gucci Guilty pour Homme Intense for the following criminal acts:

Label fraud
Fraudulence
Consumer deception
Olfactory bodily harm
Defamation of a global brand

It is not necessarily more intense than its predecessor, but rather goes in a completely different direction!

Right from the start, you can clearly perceive coriander, closely followed by orange scents...

However, a distinct sweetness is also present, without coming across as too heavy!
In my opinion, the greatest characteristic of this fragrance lies in its versatility... While some other Intense fragrances can be very heavy and are mainly intended for cold days, this one is welcome in almost any season!"

Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori,01/05/2021,RioImHerzen,F,6,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,15,Tuberose in its most beautiful form,"""Opulent"" is one of those terms that rarely appears in my vocabulary - perhaps because I have always understood it to have a slightly negative connotation: too rich, too exuberant, lavish abundance... Despite these associations, ""opulent"" describes the fragrance very accurately, and certainly in a positive sense!

The scent is linear and very ""dense"" - like a walk through a lush flower garden in summer. Framed by trellises adorned with plump, white blooms, a narrow path winds through the sea of flowers. The sun shines warmly from the sky, the air is humid, and one feels as if they are drowning in the sweet floral scent. Yet in the center of the garden stands an iron fountain, providing a bit of the refreshing relief one hopes for and inviting you to linger.

Performance and intensity are very good. The fact that the fragrance does not develop significantly on my skin does not detract from it; it remains rich and floral until the end. Tuberose and jasmine dominate and create a beautiful, opulent unity. A hint of green freshness prevents the scent from becoming too heavy. More of a fragrance for warm months, but I have already worn it even now in December.

The scent is exuberant, full, opulent - but that is precisely what gives it its charm. My favorite from the Bloom line."
Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori,03/04/2023,Käse,F,119,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,The Floral Scent When You're (No Longer) in the Mood for Flowers,"With floral scents, you really can't lure me out from behind the stove anymore. Once my favorite fragrance direction, I now find many floral scents simply boring. A bit overdone.

That's why my expectations were low here. I got a sample and thought to myself, I'll spray it on, write a statement, and then shower late in the morning, so it doesn't matter if the scent gets washed away.

But then the green fairy appeared :D No, I didn't open a bottle of absinthe; I sprayed on the Gucci. A sea of floral scent at its finest. I once had a floral scent that smelled like a flower shop. But not in a good way. In some flower shops, it smells so organically pungent. That's not the case here. Here, it's just beautifully floral.

After a while, maybe a quarter of an hour, the jasmine comes through. Then you have a really lovely jasmine tea-like scent that is neither too sweet nor too bitter, but just right.

It makes you want flowers again :)"
Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori,01/12/2022,Mementum,F,5,,6,Asian Jasmine,"Smells like a wonderful jasmine tea. However, the bitterness is softened by the sweetness of the rose notes. A very intense, room-filling but pleasant fragrance. Longevity and sillage are truly above average. I love it, I think it will be my new ""signature"" scent. The thought that others will remember this fragrance when they think of me would definitely be nice."
Bloom Ambrosia di Fiori,12/12/2023,RocherMoe,F,41,,1,"Jasmine, Jasmine, Jasmine...","I perceive the jasmine scent very strongly... actually all the time.

After 2 hours, nothing changes... I still smell jasmine, sometimes lighter, sometimes more intense....
Unfortunately, I notice no transition from top to base note... monotonous jasmine, which becomes very exhausting and unpleasant over time.

With a lot of imagination, it tells me this ""baby-rose-hint of scent: 'Hello, I’m somewhere there....'

The price is great, intensity very good, lasts a long time and activates more or less (that’s my perception)."
Gucci by Gucci Sport pour Homme,03/24/2012,Missk,F,1357,,2,A sporty cologne that deserves a place on the shelf,"Many find this fragrance bland, boring and unoriginal, a scent that didn't live up to the expectations set by the original Gucci by Gucci pour Homme. I don't agree. I find Gucci by Gucci Sport a deliciously refreshing scent, perfect for hot Summer days and sporty activities.

This fragrance opens with a watery burst of fizzy grapefruit, mint and greenery. It reminds me slightly of cooling cucumber, however it may be the cypress that makes me feel this way.

The sillage is moderate, so it doesn't overpower. It just lingers softly on the skin, catching whiffs of it here and there.

I like the sporty concept, although for some I know, they find it too predictable and overdone. Let's just say that I live with a man that frequents the gym quite regularly, and when he wears heavy deoderants or colognes it makes him smell absolutely repulsive. However lighter scents, like Cool Water by Davidoff, Hei by Alfred Sung and fragrances like this one, last the duration of the workout and don't clash with a male's natural perspiration.

The cardamon, ambrette seeds and patchouli gives this fragrance a wonderfully grounded earthiness. However for those that detest patchouli, I guarantee that in this fragrance it does not dominate. The scent remains fresh and light throughout the composition.

Gucci by Gucci Sport keeps growing on me. Its clean, menthol-like scent, makes me long for the hot weather and hot men. Cheeky I know, it's the fragrance doing the talking, not me I swear."
Gucci by Gucci Sport pour Homme,03/03/2015,ColinM,M,516,,0,Well...,"Gucci by Gucci Sport is possibly the worst Gucci scent I’ve ever tried so far. It’s unbelievable how cheap and sad this brand has become, at least for the perfumes (thanks, Frida!). Well, anyway, if you’re nonetheless curious about how it smells and the term “utter crap” is not clear enough... basically as the name suggests, this is a shallow, cheap, metallic and conventional “sport” scent, so imagine plastic citrus notes, synthetic woody-norlimbanol base notes, a sort of aromatic-herbal accord between the two, random ozonic whiffs. Nothing more, nothing less than a deodorant. As much fresh as tacky. Pathetic.

Gucci by Gucci Sport pour Homme,03/04/2017,Jus2108,M,16,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Gucci by Gucci Sport Pour Homme,"I only came across a Gucci perfume by chance, as I found it in a sale. I then smelled the perfume in the store and was blown away by the very citrusy scent. At first, I couldn't quite decide because in the store, when I sprayed it, it couldn't fully develop due to the store being a bit overheated (in my opinion). Anyway, I then wandered around the city a bit more and found it very good after it had unfolded.

The perfume is suitable for any occasion and is especially pleasant to smell in spring/summer. It also does not come across as overpowering. The components or the transitions from top, heart, and base notes are quite fleeting, which I find a bit unfortunate. I also would have wished for the perfume to last a bit longer or to be a bit more concentrated. However, the sport designation on the bottle is well-deserved in my opinion. Overall, I find the bottle very beautifully designed and would also be happy if Gucci would continue to keep the perfume, which is probably not the case :(

So go to the store and at least give it a try. But I would strongly suspect that anyone who does not like the CHANEL ALLURE HOMME SPORT perfume would not like this one either.

So give it a try, as long as it is still available online or in your stores :)"

Gucci by Gucci Sport pour Homme,08/23/2011,Alucard,M,17,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,"P&G ""lemon""","""Gucci by gucci sport pour homme"" starts pleasantly fresh with a subtle, well-measured lemon or grapefruit note. Even the slight acidity inherent in the citrus fruits has made its way into the stylish bottle this time, giving this EdT an authentic and noble entrance in its first minutes.
Unfortunately, that’s where the good times end. A cheap cypress aroma sets in. The scent becomes dull, and after 10 minutes, the lemon smells like toilet cleaner. Now it smells like an average 0815 scent from d&m. Not bad, not headache-inducing. Nevertheless, it certainly does not live up to the luxury image of the Gucci brand or its exorbitantly high price.

Re-launched as a new replay or banana scent for 20 euros, it would be a fair offer and surely a bestseller.

As expensive as it is now, it’s just a quick money grab with a trendy logo. And nothing more.

After 20 minutes, I sniffed again: still smells like lemon dish soap. I guess nothing will change from here on out.

Gucci by Gucci Sport pour Homme,07/27/2013,Cappellusman,M,358,,3,"Oh, a Sport Fragrance...","When will perfumers and labels ever realize that a ""sport fragrance"" can work without grapefruit and lemon, and possibly ONLY without these ingredients, in the sense that it remains memorable and is not arbitrary and interchangeable.

Money-making. An upscale label like Gucci puts ""Sport"" in the name and probably sells the stuff like crazy. It's jumping on a bandwagon. Well, perfume is also a business, and I suppose they are entitled to that. For a manufacturer that has created timeless classics with ""Gucci pour Homme"" and (especially) ""Gucci Nobile,"" this pandering attempt is, for me, embarrassing. Anyone who wants to smell good at the gym can find something equally good for significantly less money."
Gucci by Gucci Sport pour Homme,10/08/2013,Leimbacher,M,2870,,2,Double-Meaning Fig,"Enough has been mourned for the old Guccis, and rightly so, I have also torn apart Gucci by Gucci and the new Made to Measure. Both disappointed me so much that I left the Sport version aside for a long time. At some point, I thought that it must be as forgettable and similarly terrible as its brothers, that I must have forgotten my own test. Until today, when I found nothing unfamiliar in the store and checked again whether I had really had it under my nose. And there it was, I had not. But better late than never, here is my test.

GbG Sport definitely takes advantage of my extremely low expectations and presents itself much better than the other new Guccis. If I liked figs, this somewhat more upscale, noble athlete would even deserve a good rating. But again, I do not like this extremely green note, fortunately, it is just one of many notes.

GbG Sport starts with a juicy-green, slightly sour grapefruit. It also has a very slight woody undertone of cypress. Then the fragrance becomes more serious and even more suitable for everyday wear, with the fig coming in, beautifully complemented by berries and cardamom. It’s not a power fragrance and there’s no Aha effect, but it is definitely the best Gucci men’s fragrance of the last few years. The scent ends in a slightly powdery musk-vetiver clearing, which emphasizes the green-spontaneous character of the fragrance once again.

The bottle remains top-notch and is so beautiful and heavy that one wishes the scents would come close to it. Sillage is hardly present, longevity is about 6 hours.

But the fragrance is worth testing and is a successful all-rounder, which only suffers a bit from fig-minus points for me. On the other hand, Gucci was not quite as banal and cowardly here as with Guilty and Co."
Gucci by Gucci Sport pour Homme,07/06/2013,FLUidENTITY,M,246,,3,Bubbly Mainstream. Neon-Pastel Chemistry.,"Hm. Perhaps it can be said that the strongest sports wave of summer 2013 is over, although there are still some latecomers arriving, such as Freedom Sport. And so this comment might be a bit behind as well. But for summer 2013, I’ve let quite a few scents pass through my nose, including GbGpHS. (oops, long abbreviation, but what can you do :D)

All in all, this Gucci is indeed elegant and fresh. It might have something special. You could say it’s lemon dish soap, but a special lemon dish soap that shimmers in its own colors.

At the beginning, the scent is truly refreshing. Fresh and fruity is the opening. Cypress and grapefruit, however, seem almost a bit sticky, I would say. The freshness comes through quite well, but it leans towards being a bit cloying. The opening might actually be the best part of the fragrance, as it is quite multifaceted. The fruits seem to bubble over and glow in synthetic neon pastel colors.

Unfortunately, the further development of the scent is not really lovingly crafted. It becomes more robust and masculine, a bit sturdier, okay. But in the end, it just falls apart. Patchouli is really different. And wanting to incorporate patchouli into such a summer-fresh scent, well, I don’t know, it just doesn’t quite fit in my nose.

Overall, you can’t really go wrong with this scent. It doesn’t clash anywhere. The sillage also contributes its part. There’s no significant projection, maybe the first half hour to hour, but I’m not paying this price for that. It’s really a bit excessive.
The longevity doesn’t fare well either. 4 hours, and then it’s already over, and the scent might just pass as a nice laundry detergent for the clothes you’re currently wearing.

The bottle, on the other hand, is, I assume, the engine of the sales figures. It’s really delicate, elegant, and tasteful.

In principle, I don’t want to completely condemn the scent. There’s an effort for elegance. But it’s only an effort. The scent has potential but gets lost halfway and doesn’t reach its destination. However, the versatility is truly worth highlighting. Versatility: AAA"
Gucci by Gucci Sport pour Homme,04/30/2020,SpicyDice,M,38,,3,Fruity Fresh!,"When I was in London in 2017, I sniffed through a few perfumes again. It was one of the warmest summers I have experienced, so I stepped away from my gourmand preferences and looked for something fresh.

I am a fan of the classic Acqua di Gio and find Gucci Sport quite similar, just a bit more citrusy than Armani's classic. I can't necessarily pick out the juniper berry or the other notes. I can smell grapefruit, cypress, and patchouli. Of course, you don't have much time for the fragrance to develop, more on that shortly.

The bottle looks interesting and especially the heavy cap is really very solid and made of metal. The spray head is also well-made; after several years of use, nothing has worn out. Great!

What is unfortunately not so great is the performance. This fragrance unfortunately does not project strongly even right after application, and even on my skin, I can't smell it after 1-3 hours, let alone in the air. If Gucci could improve this, it would really have a great, citrusy fragrance in an interesting bottle for summer!"

Gucci by Gucci Sport pour Homme,07/01/2015,Waterbubbles,M,12,,1,peppermint tea plastic cup,"I was fooled in the store by a fleeting test. It smelled zesty lemony. Also somehow like Yuzu. That matched the green color.
I then wrote it on my Christmas wish list and received it as a gift.
However, I was ultimately disappointed. Because the lemony scent was just an illusion. It seems to be temporarily triggered by other things, the lemony impression. With the fig, I don't know whether to like it or not. I feel this way about the whole perfume.
It would benefit from an additional, not too sour, not too sweet lemon, as that would reduce the rather peculiar character of the fig.
What really bothers me is the peppermint smell. It smells like older peppermint tea in a Tupperware cup with a lid that has been there for a while.... I often experienced that in school ;)
Without this mint, I would like it much more.
The perfume made me think of certain things right away in the first hours: elitist and arrogant.
Somehow it has an aloof quality. Which is neither meant positively nor negatively.
Longevity and sillage are once again outrageous. You need about 10 sprays to smell it for 45 minutes.
The bottle is super beautiful but somehow has a wannabe elite vibe. That has been quite well achieved ;)
It's almost like a parody. This bottle and then the content. Also, the much too light, shallow content does not match the heavy appearance.
Conclusion: one probably needs to test much more intensively before buying or wishing for something."

Gucci by Gucci Sport pour Homme,02/25/2020,Morpheus1,M,72,,1,At least the green-red stripes look sporty,"... on the beautiful rubberized white travel spray bottle and the packaging.

Everything else regarding the scent has nothing to do with sports.

It starts with bitter grapefruit and (green) mandarin with cypress. Everything still feels a bit immature and green behind the ears.

The base scent, on the other hand, consists of a green-woody-herbaceous-bitter fig/peppermint tea mixture, with synthetic lemon as an accompaniment. The tea has been sitting for a few days, and not everyone will like the fig. A certain synthetic quality resonates throughout the fragrance, of course.

The opening is citrusy-bitter-sweet, which lasts only a short time but is still the best part of the scent.

But that likely deceived many at first glance, myself included.

No, the fragrance is unfortunately truly not a masterpiece.
It is also not really citrusy fresh.
That is simply incorrect.

Longevity and sillage are not great and can be described as poor.

After a short time, it can only be perceived up close."
Gucci by Gucci Sport pour Homme,04/05/2010,Maulwurf84,M,48,,4,The First Disappointment from Gucci,"Gucci is my favorite brand when it comes to fragrances. I may not have tried them all, but I find all their scents excellent. Well, I don't know the ones before Rush (1999). However, the rest completely convinces me, the regular Gucci by Gucci is my favorite scent at the moment.
I could hardly wait to test the sporty successor. Finally, it was released, and I rushed to the store and sprayed it on.
Well, I am disappointed. The Sport version does not smell bad in the sense of being repulsive, but the scent is quite modest, simple, and artificial. I detect a weak citrus top note and then a fruity fig accord. Nothing more comes after that. It is a light and fruity fragrance, carefree and good for summer, but a drugstore scent like Puma can surely do that too. Rush, Gucci PH 1 and 2, as well as Envy were truly special fragrances that stood out from the crowd with their concept and also smelled great. These scents were/are made for men, while GbG Sport smells like a teenager. GbG Sport is at best mediocre and simply boring. It's a shame, because Gucci usually brings much stronger offerings to the market and not such weak fruity waters.
If you're looking for a sporty scent, you’d be better off checking out Dior Homme Sport or Chanel Allure Homme Sport, which are made much better, last longer, and in my opinion, are also more mature.
Better luck next time, Gucci!"

Gucci by Gucci Sport pour Homme,02/28/2010,Muenchner,M,49,,3,The Honor of Sports.,"Testing this fragrance was a challenge for me, somehow every sports scent has disappointed me so far.
So I only have one question: Can Gucci save the honor of sports, or will it fade into the insignificance like so many other sports fragrances??
The top note of this fragrance makes a nice start; I detect a light grapefruit-lime scent, which is not listed but I can clearly pick it out. The aroma is citrusy, but it excites me much more than what I usually smell in sports fragrances.
After about half an hour, the juniper and fig come out and cover the top note, which I find a bit disappointing because I liked it. But hey, that's how the fragrance develops; overall, I would describe the heart note as fruity and slightly sweet, but only very lightly.
This note fades after about 2 hours, and the scent settles into a slightly earthy vetiver blend, where I can faintly perceive the lime that I have been missing for the past 2 hours.

All in all, one can say that Gucci has managed to save the honor of sports, even though the fragrance has the usual Gucci trait of being very close to the body, the longevity of 3-5 hours is not impressive, and the heart note ruins the entire fragrance.
I would recommend the fragrance for students and office workers, for daily use; you can't really go wrong with it, almost everyone will like it. It doesn't overpower a room but stays close to the body, and it shows style that you don't wear a generic scent.

The bottle is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen; neither glass nor metal has been spared here, it is a real gem for any bathroom or vanity.

All in all, I give it 80%, as it does a lot right, but for my taste, it stays a bit too close to the body, the heart note doesn't quite fit into the fragrance development (but it doesn't disturb), and it has managed to convince me despite the name sports.
I thought again about my rating and decided that it is a bit too high; the fragrance is still a great thing, but I find 80% a bit too high when compared to other fragrances that receive 80% from me. It is still a great scent and remains one of my recommendations for purchase."
Gucci by Gucci Sport pour Homme,07/28/2010,Ryker,M,23,,1,Gucci for Everyone,"I received a sample of Gucci Sport pour Homme while shopping at my perfume store.

First impression: Fresh, has something!
The fruity grapefruit/tangerine freshness comes through immediately. From start to finish, there is a lightly spicy background present, although the fruity note always dominates.
I can't smell the patchouli from the base note, but I could be mistaken.

Second impression: Boring!
Somehow, the scent doesn't really develop and smells quite unremarkable. The 08/15 fragrance for everyone. Please don't get me wrong: it never smells bad or anything, but it clearly has too little character for me.

Recommendation to buy? No! Gifted, but certainly wearable, as it is never unpleasant.
For me, it lacks punk rock!"
Gucci by Gucci Sport pour Homme,10/31/2010,Friendchild,M,112,,2,"The bottle definitely looks very, very elegant!","My father has been using this fragrance for some time now and I have to say that I find it quite brilliant as well. It is not particularly special, but it serves its purpose as an everyday scent, as well as an evening fragrance. I actually find the fresh top note with which the scent starts to be the most successful, it's a pity that it settles so early on my skin. The drydown is very pleasant and I don't find it at all overpowering. As for the longevity, it is really sufficient. On me, the scent lasts a good 6 hours, which isn't too long when compared to other brands and fragrances.
In my eyes, it is not a pure summer scent, as it is too spicy for that, but I also have a different idea of what a classic summer fragrance should be like. However, I must say that it works absolutely well in autumn and winter ;)"
Gucci by Gucci Sport pour Homme,10/06/2024,Dionysos2022,M,945,,1,It's autumn and I...,"... am walking with my dogs. It is still warm and we pass by some pear trees that are exuding their wonderful aroma. A branch with pears is hanging over the garden fence, and I am cheeky enough to grab one. Just then, an older lady comes from the other side of the fence and says, ""Please take as many as you like; I can't eat them all by myself."" Caught, I turn red and apologize, and she says, ""I was serious; I have way too many."" So, I take a few more and thank her.

When I apply this fragrance, the first thing I notice is pears, even though they are not listed in the fragrance pyramid. There are also citrus and green notes. A bit of spiciness comes through as well. The patchouli adds a fresh touch, and the vetiver gives it a slightly dry quality.

The longevity and sillage are average.

This is a fragrance that can be worn by any age group. On warmer days, it is a lovely scent for the office, school, or even for sports. I can also imagine a sporty woman wearing this fragrance.

Rush for Men,06/24/2021,HugoMontez,M,81,,5,Woody musky sexyness!,"Gucci Rush for Men is so good that it's one of the few discontinued fragrances that truly deserves a comeback.

Gucci nowadays has almost nothing interesting in their fragrance line for men. Guilty Absolute, that offers a woody-leather experience and the underrated Guilty Cologne are probably the only ones that i can recommend. But back in the late 90's and early 00's, Tom Ford was in charge and put some ideas on the table.

One of the best examples was this fragrance. A woody fragrance composed by Antoine Maisondieu and Daniela Andrier. Two great perfumers who created some great fragrances throughout the years. They joined again later for Bottega Veneta pour homme, another great woody-leather fragrance with pine needles upfront.

This one was launched in the beginning of the new millennium and followed a new genre of woody masculines. The milky nuance is, I believe, popularized by Feu D'Issey in '98 but doomed because it was a feminine release. This time, the milky sandalwood was joined by Cedar and Cypress with a musky finale.

Seems and feels simple, and it really is, but in a beautiful and comforting way. A second skin experience. There's definitely Iso E Super here, supporting the woods and along with the musk, helping the increase of longevity. Very dry and fresh woody fragrance with milky nuances.

The opening has light green cypress leafs and echos of Encre Noire. Both have cypress and iso E super so the comparison is logical, but this is more milky, creamy and more musky. Also more rounded and second skin-like. They just have a similar woody-new wave style.

After the opening, it mellows a bit, tuning down the cypress and cedar note and increasing the musk one. It turns into a beautiful sensual milky musk with a masculine (and new at the time) woody trail. It doesn't last long (3-5h usually) and doesn't project great, but it acts like a sexy skin scent and i like that.

It's something that i can see in the niche world easily, cause it's very conceptual and avant-garde at the time. One fragrance that has some similarities is Azzaro Visit but that one is more sweet and it lacks the beautiful musk note. And it doesn't have the green cypress. It's more a alternative on a budget.

And speaking about the price, this is ultra expensive nowadays due to its discontinuation. So I can't recommend you for those prices. But if you find this under 90€/100ml I would pick it up. It's good, unique, sexy, avant-garde and it comes in a beautiful retro plastic and metallic bottle that seems like it came from the 80's.

Overall, a beautiful woody scent that i will miss when I finish my bottle. Luckily, I still have +90ml of juice to enjoy!

Rush for Men,04/19/2020,TomFragance,M,34,,0,Back to the Future,"If they asked me that the smell could have the future, this fragrance would come to mind. It seems an essence that has come to us with the capsule of time, it seems to have come out of the Scream video by Michael and Janet Jackson, starting from the bottle, a parallelepiped made of plastic and white metal, which recalls so much the purity, and the modern minimalism of the perfume, a bottle that looks like it looks like the packaging of the first iPods, born a few years later. After the 2000s, Gucci churned out three important masterpieces, Gucci pour homme, Gucci Envy and Gucci Rush for Man, the latter notch above his siblings.
It opens with very aromatic and sophisticated woods, almost soft and creamy, however creamy a wood could be, Mysore sandalwood, Bois d'Okoumé and juniper blend with an incense base, white musks, patchouli and lavender that makes the fragrance slightly powdery, clean, modern and slightly lactaginous. A woody-spicy, all the ingredients are clear, limpid, bleached, the perfume plays on the white color, on soft geometries, on neutrality, with a futuristic concept, very linear, aseptic but at the same time relaxing, comforting, beautiful, young, suitable for any occasion, hyper-versatile, in any context, I can't find a time of year where to place it, but I would avoid the hot months.
In the perfume there is also the touch of Tom Ford and you can see (and hear) and coincidentally many indelible scents of past years have his signature. For just this reason, every perfume collector should have this piece of history, or rather, this fragment of the future.

Rush for Men,11/11/2013,Siebter,M,49,,17,Amphetamine Sun,"The year 2000 seems to me, in retrospect, not to have been a particularly exciting time in terms of perfume.

However, I spent a total of about twelve minutes per year in perfumeries back then, so my depiction of a historical review may not hold up entirely. Had I stumbled upon Rush at that time, I would surely have picked it up, but I don't recall seeing it back then. Today, the last bottles of Rush are being offered for a lot of money on eBay; I was lucky enough to acquire it for a relatively moderate sum.

I wouldn't pay the prices being asked on eBay, but I can understand why it has a loyal following, as even today there are very few fragrances that have a similar vibe. Rush is a woodsy scent with a lot of incense, but unlike the retro scents Envy and Gucci Pour Homme that also emerged from Tom Ford's Gucci era, it feels very contemporary and modern. Typical of its time yet not retro in feel, perhaps because the era was anti-retro, looking forward with anticipation.

Rush is first and foremost a rush of speed. The hyper-dynamic opening is among the best I have ever experienced; like a blindingly bright tornado, this scent engulfs me in the first hour. Ice-cold incense, musk, and a blueberry note that I don't see mentioned anywhere else are at the center, soon joined by the coniferous wood accord that I will describe in more detail shortly. Rush does not come across as synthetic in my nose; nevertheless, it is not a forest scent. If the opening of Rush had a sound, it would be that of a lightsaber being activated. I mean this quite positively, as this scent is not aggressive; it conveys a pleasant inner tension, a go-for-it! mentality that I find pretty cool.

When I think of wood and incense, I immediately think of Comme des Garçons, who often explore both themes, and without a doubt, Rush could be a scent from CdG. There is even a CdG fragrance that Rush is often compared to: Wonderwood. Anyone familiar with both scents will hardly be able to overlook the similarities, even though they are quite different. What unites them is the distinctive wood accord, particularly based on cedar, cypress, and sandalwood; both fragrances also contain incense and patchouli. Perhaps some may know this: when you pile up mulch, leave it overnight, and then poke it the next morning, a resinous, ethereal steam escapes, very woody but not dry, rather incredibly fresh and a bit oily. The YouTube reviewer Kristo once described this in relation to Wonderwood as ""stardust soaked in motor oil."" Both fragrances perfectly capture this scent for me. However, Wonderwood is darker, not as transparent as Rush, and also more monothematic; Rush, on the other hand, has a clearly defined development with distinct phases.

The ethereal-woody heart dominates most of the scent's progression. The scent cloud's reach is rather limited but persistent; it won't fill halls, but within its aura, this fragrance is quite dominant. Gradually becoming a bit darker, it still feels effervescent, fresh, and absolutely optimistic; it also conveys a vibe that is not necessarily sensual but certainly hedonistic. Woody scents are often dry, dark, and sometimes even gnarly, but this fragrance is never so, despite its pronounced woodiness. When I wear Rush, I do so because I feel decisive, spontaneous, and confident.

The longevity is quite okay, typical for an EdT at around seven hours, sometimes less. The base is characterized by very soft sandalwood, contrasted by musk and patchouli, both absurdly clean, which keeps this fragrance uplifting until the end. I really enjoy the varied progression of Rush; it follows a clear red thread without becoming boring. And hey: it simply smells really good; high-end designers rarely achieve better. Despite the CdG resemblance, this fragrance is also an incredibly good all-rounder. It probably wouldn't withstand a winter storm and doesn't quite fit a funeral, but otherwise, it's suitable for almost any occasion. Rush is not a unisex fragrance in the classical sense; however, I now consider the categorization as a unisex scent in many cases to be just as limiting as the division into femme and homme fragrances; Rush is a masculine scent that can also be worn by a woman. It also resembles Wonderwood in this regard."
Rush for Men,04/24/2013,Leimbacher,M,2870,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Cyber-Space Clearing,"About €2 per ml for this discontinued treasure (50ml - €102)... a real risk and by far the most expensive scent (in relation) in my collection! I took the plunge despite my concerns, as you can never be sure if the bottles are too old or have gone off. But I was not disappointed.

Gucci Rush is positioned almost exactly between the 2 Pour Hommes and is extremely pleasant and unique. It oscillates between futuristic and woody, is ultra-synthetic, and reminds one of a cyberspace world. But I have rarely smelled such a good fragrance that, precisely because of this synthetic and plastic nature, is truly one of a kind! Rush is anything but rushed. It is likable, calm, relaxed, perfectly styled, and fitting to the bottle as if it just came out of Kubrick's sci-fi masterpiece 2001. I smell lavender, cypress, many soft woods, especially the finest sandalwood I know. And there is plenty of that, even in cheap perfumes. And here you can see how it is done right. On top of that, a light touch of musk completes the perfect, elegant everyday and office scent that is probably 100 years ahead of its time. It reminds me of an illusion of a clearing in the woods and an ultra-sterile, painted forest image that one wants to fall into. But it is all artificially created. Whether everyone will like that is another question. For me, occasionally, definitely, and perfect for the office. Just a shame to wear it daily/often, and I will be careful not to press the spray head too often. Although I would love to press it more often :)

The bottle is grand and typical of the turn of the millennium, when it was unclear where the journey was headed. But definitely spaced out and ultra-chic. Unfortunately just plastic, but very well made and reminiscent of the now huge apple brand. Longevity is unfortunately a bit lacking, the magical spell from the art forest lasts only 6-8 hours. Creamy, bright, delicious, elegant, gentle. Gucci makes me swoon once again! The sillage is also rather weak, more of a casual aura than a cloud of fragrance.

Another real treat from Gucci, as good as PHI and extremely rare now. But at the eBay prices and immediately after the first sniff, you can tell that the fans are right and that you hold something extraordinary in your hands, which does not flaunt but simply offers solid uniqueness from a time when Gucci still dominated the mainstream market!"
Rush for Men,06/09/2022,GregoryPeck,M,3,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,"Gucci ""Rush for Men"": A Fragrance Addiction Career","During earlier times of peace and until then unprecedented freedom, I found myself on a winter flight towards the tropical islands under the wind aboard a South American vulture machine, where I purchased a bottle of a fragrance that was so completely different from anything I had sniffed up to that point. My first, intoxicating impression was shaped by the perception of new, artificially but very pleasantly perceived scent substances, like those emanating from a freshly opened bucket of latex dispersion paint, which surely must have been similar to the components of the fragrance in the cellar of a mushroom farm. Leaving the cellar of the mushroom cultivation station via the scent bridge of the mushrooms, one enters a damp, moss-covered coniferous mixed forest, with an extremely woody-resinous atmosphere. The base for me was the smell of a handful of moist humus from the forest floor.

I was consistently blown away by this slightly artificial, green-earthy-spicy-resinous scent and surely evaporated more than 3 liters over my skin surface into the surroundings in the following years. Since the H/S was not overly pronounced, not much was left from a morning application, but certain reactions from people in the morning public transport suggested that not everyone shared my enthusiasm for this fragrance. Now and then, it actually happened that individuals suddenly fled from me, coughing and crying like a baby.

I may be mistaken, but as far as I remember, one of the main components was a form of oak moss, which over time was proven to have a highly allergenic effect and therefore could no longer be used. To my knowledge, this led to the discontinuation of the production of Gucci Rush for Men, and thus to the end of my specific fragrance addiction career.

In the meantime, apparently new oak moss aromas have been developed/found that no longer (so strongly) act allergenically, along with many new natural but also artificial aromas. These inspire the creation of new fragrances and enrich the ""scent space."" When I recently discovered the Parfumo site, the first action was to search for Gucci Rush for Men in the database... and to find the ""duplications"" that come very close to the original scent from back then.

I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the initiators and organizers of this database for creating a freely accessible opportunity to explore the world of fragrances."
Rush for Men,12/05/2009,Apicius,M,1328,,9,Appropriate Name,"Unfortunately, this fragrance has been discontinued, but you can still find remnants online.

Rush for Men,04/18/2010,Maulwurf84,M,48,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Keep it simple,"I scored a 10ml bottle of Gucci Rush cheaply on eBay. Since Gucci fragrances usually match my taste, I took a chance with a blind buy - and I don't regret it. The bottle is probably very old and may have been poorly stored. I guess the scent is no longer present with all its notes, and the longevity has likely suffered greatly. The lavender top note can only be sensed, and the incense has unfortunately also disappeared. Rush starts off for me with a strong cedar note, ending in a creamy sandalwood base. Very simple, but very well done. Just like FrieMo, I initially found the scent a bit synthetic, but that has changed now; I find it very authentic and natural. Those who like pure wood scents (like I do) should enjoy Rush. However, the absurdly high prices you have to pay on eBay wouldn't be worth it for me. As much as I like Rush, I have to say that it doesn't work well on my skin: Like so many cedar scents, Rush turns slightly sour on my skin.

I did some research and found a few fragrances that are said to come quite close to this discontinued Gucci creation. Mourning Rush fans should test these:
Diptyque - Tam Dao (very very similar)
Carolina Herrera - 212 (from the heart note)
Creation Lamis - Si Sure Stormy Men (available for about 10 bucks)
Pal Zileri - Sartoriale (is supposedly almost identical)
Christian Lacroix - Tumulte pour homme"
Rush for Men,03/31/2010,FrieMo,M,75,HELPFUL REVIEW,0,Plastic,"You don't get to smell a fragrance like this every day. Because it no longer exists.
The opening is very hmm artificial.
The initial scent smells like plastic, but that's not a problem. On the contrary, it's something different and somehow good.
Then the lavender comes in and brightens up the plastic a bit. But soon the fragrance becomes woodier, warmer, rounder, and comes to an end.

A beautiful synthetic scent. (Emphasis on beautiful AND synthetic)"
Rush for Men,04/16/2011,Skylab,M,184,,3,Interesting Composition,"I was lucky enough to snag this fragrance (100ml) for a mere 2.- Euros at a flea market. Even more profitable, I was able to sell it on eBay - because this scent is truly a ""must have"" among fans. Just look at the bids on this sales platform...

The bottle design is simple and clean. The plastic gives it a futuristic and spacey feel.
However, altogether it gives off a rather cheap impression.

The scent itself is unobtrusive and clean.

The opening is spicy fresh...the further development is sweet woody.
It had recognizability and, looking back, it was one of the best Gucci fragrances.

Gucci Rush For Men is an all-round fragrance - suitable for every season and every occasion.

Therefore, it's incomprehensible why it was discontinued...

In hindsight, I am plagued by the thought of whether it was a mistake to let the fragrance go...well, I had only worn it twice...so there’s that ;)"
Rush for Men,12/28/2009,Andi136,M,242,,4,No longer available...,"Hmm....
I still have a little bit of it left. I don't know if I should really be sad about the discontinuation of this fragrance.
It smells a bit too much like cedar/cypress and all that woodiness; lavender is only present for me in a very light form.
Overall, I have to agree that it's relatively synthetic.
I never bought it; I received it as a full tester when it was discontinued. I probably wouldn't have bought it."

The Voice of the Snake,08/24/2025,Omnipotato,M,388,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Top tier earthy oud-leather,"The Voice of the Snake is one of those that isn’t necessarily innovative or ultra-unique but has instead taken an existing genre/DNA to its pinnacle. I see it as a combination of the rose/oud/ambrocenide of Ombre Nomade/Nouveau Monde , the woody earthy notes of Guilty Absolute pour Homme, and the dark filthy leather of Le Gemme - Falkar.

A reviewer said in a review of Dark Lord - Ex Tenebris Lux that Alberto Morillas used Guilty Absolute pour Homme as experimentation then perfected that experiment in Dark Lord. I can kind of see that, but I think the perfection was truly achieved one year later in Voice of the Snake. Funnily enough, both Dark Lord and Voice of the Snake have reviewers comparing them to Voldemort. Is it just the names that are inspiring this connection or is there some aromachemical common among these fragrances that is summoning He Who Must Not Be Named?

Because there is absolutely something sinister about Voice of the Snake. Biting leather, deep earth, venomous animalic oud. And no sweetness as the antidote to counteract it. Just all in on these ultra-dark yet sharp notes. Don’t let the “saffron” note fool you. There’s no medicinal spiciness here, it might as well be “leather” in the note pyramid. The oud is not too overwhelming, but it is a similar style to Ombre Nomade, so if you don’t like the oud there, you will probably not like it here. It dries down to a dark, deep, woody, mulchy patchouli. And it is potent! 12 hours on skin for me, and at least 6 of those it is projecting heavily.

I think even retail price is fair here, since this compares favorably with Bvlgari’s private line as well as the midrange of LV’s line in Ombre Nomade, but Voice of the Snake is currently available for $230 on Jomashop which is frankly a steal as far as I’m concerned."
The Voice of the Snake,08/19/2020,Alans,M,2,,1,Unapologetic dominant,"You will find all sorts of fine analysis on the notes of this perfume. Since I have nothing else to add to those, I'll save you the technical stuff. But I will say that one thing that strikes me about this perfume is that unlike other fragrances that put an effort in balancing notes off and creating a harmony with highs and lows and sharps and smooths, etc. this fragrance is bold and rich. The creators have sort of unapologetically stated it's dominant features, without feeling the need to sugarcoat it with unnecessary hints and notes. That aside, it's one of the most long living perfumes I have ever tried. The more interesting fact is that no matter how long after use, if you can still smell it, you will smell all of it's base, subnotes and features. It's as if all of them attenuate together, which indicates they have been well balanced in the first place."
The Voice of the Snake,10/26/2023,Jaular,M,7,,1,The Tom Riddle Parfum,"What a special perfume and it really is the perfume that Tom Riddle would use, elegant dark and very cold.

It cannot be used indoors with more than 2 sprays.

It is a beast in projection and duration.

It is very worth it and despite being a dark perfume it is not too difficult and its trail is delicious"
The Voice of the Snake,03/20/2020,Atanarjuat,M,33,,16,Snake Sense,"Voice-of-the-Snake wearers possess very special sensory organs to ensure their survival.

Snakes, for example, can have varying degrees of visual acuity. Visually interesting in this case is especially the nice presentation of the delivered overall package. In the midst of the finely patterned - protective of the valuable content - packaging lies the heavy porcelain bottle: deep black, artistically ornamented.

Snake wearers absorb scent and taste particles through flicking and their tongue. The sense of smell is particularly well developed in snakes; otherwise, they wouldn't have any of their own bouquet! Through the bifurcation of the tongue, the Gucci snake can spatially orient itself with the information it has gathered. The two tongue tips act like fine measuring devices that can distinguish even the smallest differences in scent molecules: deep shadowy patchouli, serious saffron, and finely cultivated dark woody oud. A pleasing, attractive oud. Equipped this way, they can perceive their surroundings even when their sense of sight is limited. Preferably at night. This is especially important for locating prey animals, but also for escaping potential enemies or even finding partners for reproduction. The scent aura slithers between mystique, the mysterious, and - due to the fine, pure composition blade - enhancing libido. Discreet delicacy throughout the softly smoldering scent progression.

While some senses in snakes are excellently developed, the sense of hearing is quite the opposite: snakes are nearly deaf. They can perceive ground vibrations through their lower jaw. In some species, such as the Voice-of-the-Snake wearers, this means they are not only warned of approaching enemies but can also locate and catch prey at night. The only sound present is the stretched hissing of the snake bottle when spraying the venom - a distinctive spray head, a soft whisper.

Snakes can also detect the smallest temperature fluctuations. Through thermal perception, our snakes can particularly well track warm-blooded fellow humans. This means they can hunt even in complete darkness. However, even during the day, the scent remains discreet and the snake present.

Voice-of-the-Snake wearers are clever, have a keen mind, dislike haste, are interested in the deeper meanings, and remain enigmatic and mysterious (sillage) while being extremely loyal beings (longevity) with an infallible sense for their fellow humans (scent).

The Voice of the Snake is a truly enchanting and simultaneously unconditionally unencumbered, subtly dark, and conspiratorial fragrance. I hereby warn you of its wearers!"
The Voice of the Snake,07/30/2019,Mörderbiene,M,46,,13,Just Another Rose-Saffron-Oud,"No! Not at all! No Rose-Saffron-Oud!

After a guided tour through the most beautiful bottles in a small perfumery across the pond, which I had initiated without any ulterior motive by mentioning my preference not only for Penhaligon's scents but also for their containers to the friendly saleswoman, several unsolicited fragrance samples found their way into the little bag, including this relatively new Gucci.
Although I had commented quite favorably on the Gucci bottles of the new series during said tour, my expectations for the scent itself were limited. These low expectations were somewhat confirmed after my test of the rose fragrance from the series yesterday.
This allowed the fragrance to surprise me all the more - positively.
The oud takes center stage and comes without any sweet floral notes, rather harshly, and is supported by quite bitter saffron and deep, dry patchouli as supporting characters. One might think that this combination could be somewhat one-dimensional without a counterpart, but in this case, the interesting part is taken on by the volume. It doesn't storm into the bar, clumsily with baggage, loudly demanding a drink and rudely insulting everyone present, no, it is the stranger with the grim, proud gaze and a threatening aura, who has been sitting alone in the dark corner all evening, silencing the newly arrived intruder with a silent look. This guy knows what he has, and everyone else knows it too, without him having to shout it out loud.
Creaky-dry, bitterly wicked, and yet completely still.
I like it very much!"

The Voice of the Snake,11/08/2021,TristanKalus,M,130,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,The Unruffled Snake,"A dry gust let individual grains of sand trickle over the glossy black scale segments of the slowly winding snake. The leathery segments glided almost smoothly over the dry, rugged ground, over brittle woods and through sporadically growing saffron and patchouli flowers.

Gucci's The Voice of the Snake comes as a thoroughly dry oud fragrance. In the first moments of spraying, a very intense medicinal form of the oud accord used here unfolds.

You have to like it - I do!

Once the first veil of oud has settled, it becomes distinctly leathery. The leather note used here most likely results from the saffron and lies more in the light and airy spectrum, rather than in that of heavy and dark leather. This gives the fragrance, despite its intensity, a certain lightness and delicacy. The whole is accompanied by a subtle sweetness of saffron and a warm, nutty, almost cocoa-like hint of patchouli.

And that’s it. Gucci's Voice of the Snake is neither greatly complex nor does the fragrance exhibit a noticeable progression. However, that is not what bothers me here. I had to think long before I figured it out - it’s the coumarin. In my opinion, a little too much has been used here, which results in me being reminded of Viktor & Rolf's Spicebomb Extreme from time to time.

In conclusion, it can be said that it is quite a nice release, but for me, it lacks enough unique features to make it a staple in my collection."
The Voice of the Snake,08/03/2024,NiceSmell,M,241,,4,Into the Desert...it Takes Your Breath Away,"Recently tested Gucci The Voice of the Snake and what can I say. 2 sprays on the test strip and then I smelled it...I was momentarily breathless.

It is brutally strong. Even days later, it barely faded. The full power of the ouds, little patchouli, and even less saffron (in my opinion) I can barely sense in the background. Only 3 ingredients are listed, but they pack a punch. Alberto Morillas has delivered a masterpiece here.

From the very first second, hard leather, quite smoky. You have to like that. And if you are a fan of it, this is a top recommendation.

That's how I imagine it. In the desert, having not drunk anything for a long time. Slowly, the dizziness sets in and you lie on the ground in the sand. A rattlesnake looks me straight in the eyes, hisses with its tongue, and rattles its tail...ready to strike.

Longevity and sillage...very, very strong. Less is more. 1-2 sprays maximum!!!"
Tears of Iris,08/30/2025,KT4267,F,14,,1,An eyelet dress iris perfume,"It opens with what I call the “sweet spot” for Iris: balanced perfectly between an earthy, rooty iris and a powdery one. Never truly tipping too far one way or the other. The iris at the open is similar in shape to Iris de Nuit by HEELEY (not quite as carroty as this one however) but settles to a steely, cool, iris very similar to Harmonist Royal Earth.

Once dried down, this is a shier iris, sitting close to the skin. It’s no powerhouse.

I had been sampling this off and on for about a year before I made my decision to purchase. So despite what others point to as performance issues (and they are correct) it’s such a beautiful soft fragrance that I wanted to add.

To me, this is a white eyelet dress: soft, delicate."
Tears of Iris,02/11/2022,Turandot,F,839,,57,Something is always...,"For a long time, I was a devoted fan of iris, as I found the often delicate buttery note enchanting, and over time I had several iris fragrances in my collection. Until - yes, until I grew weary of iris. Instead of being softly creamy, I found it rather powdery and, after prolonged use, even dusty and oppressive. From L' Erbolario to Le Galion, Prada to Guerlain, I was constantly searching for the iris that used to bring a smile to my face, but in vain. I almost resigned myself, but then Gucci announced the Tears of Iris, the first revisions were promising, and the beautiful video in the advertisement did the rest. I participated in a sharing. Should I come close to my iris dream again?

I was about to rejoice. There it was, the finely powdery, lovely, romantic pastel note that makes you forget everyday life, a hint of nostalgia, a bit of shabby chic, and due to the opulence, I already planned to dose the sample from the sharing as discreetly as possible, so I wouldn't fall into the temptation of ""more is more"" and thus destroy the fragrance's aura.

The disappointment came so unexpectedly that it felt almost like a shock, because after hardly an hour, the Tears of Iris had dried up, and I could only faintly sense the excitement that had moved me just moments before, close to the skin. Gone - simply gone! I don't know what went wrong in the development of the fragrance, as other iris perfumes have always had a normal progression. So it can't be the iris itself. Anyway, I felt like many other fragrance enthusiasts - the longevity is not worth mentioning, and thus the fragrance was stripped of its soul. For the delicate nuance of the scent that lingers after hours, I don't need to get too close to my piggy bank.

I will use up the sample and put the topic of iris on hold for now. Perhaps I will also return to my roots and treat myself to ""Hiris"" by Hermes again."
Tears of Iris,05/06/2020,Kieran,M,9,,15,You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be,"Every time I wear this fragrance and perceive its scent, I have the song ""Iris"" by the Goo Goo Dolls in my head. This is not only due to the name similarity but also to the lyrics and the mood that the song conveys.

Lines like ""And I'd give up forever to touch you"" or ""You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be"" wonderfully reflect the unattainable elegance that the fragrance radiates, as well as a feeling of security: ""When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am."" A place of refuge on one's own skin.

The fragrance always remains in balance. It is mature, yet not outdated, but rather experienced. It is dry, yet lively enough not to be boring. It is floral and powdery, while also being woody. Suitable for all genders equally.

""And all I can taste is this moment, And all I can breathe is your life"" translates excellently to the longevity and sillage of ""Tears of Iris."" Unfortunately, the place of refuge does not linger long on the skin and can only be perceived in close proximity. Time with the fragrance flies by as if it were just a moment, yet in this moment, there is so much, as if ""Tears of Iris"" has breathed its whole life into it.

Gucci encourages layering the fragrance with perfumed oils and Acque Profumate from The Alchemist's Garden series to make the place of refuge your home. However, I do not want that; I would like to spend more time solely with ""Tears of Iris"": ""And I don't want to go home right now."""
Tears of Iris,02/09/2019,Smellie13,F,28,,23,The Ashes of the Phoenix,"After just discovering the wonderful iris fragrance ""Ida Violet,"" I did not expect such a quickly following divine top note to come flying at me when I sprayed ""Tears of Iris,"" like a colorful bird with the colors of the rainbow, simply beautiful. The driest iris clouds my senses; I am truly overwhelmed. Stay a while, you are sooo beautiful, I think, and I am in absolute fragrance heaven.
However, I fall abruptly from scent cloud 7 after about 5 minutes when I suddenly can perceive nothing, but really nothing at all. Highly irritated, my nose wanders back to my wrist repeatedly over the next quarter of an hour; I did spray it on, or was it all just a dream...?
And then, slowly, as if from nowhere, the scent rises like the phoenix from the ashes. It returns, but now it is transformed.
Slightly spicy angelica root makes the scent stronger now. I experience it as if the fragrance is divided in two. At first, you get the full iris charge, but after a short creative pause, the other notes unfold. I would then describe it in this further phase as woody-spicy. The iris plays more of a background role, with musk harmoniously accompanying it.
By the way, the process is slowed down when sprayed on fabric; the fine top note lasts longer, and it becomes less woody-spicy, but as Serduszko already described, rather a bit lipstick-like, which I prefer.
In the statements, a similarity to ""Misia"" was mentioned, and the question of a true Morillas was raised.
To investigate this, I sprayed all three fragrances in parallel.
Well, the common denominator with ""Misia"" is probably the spicy note. In direct comparison, ""Misia"" (I used the edP) is clearer; there is no woody musk note here like in ""Tears of Iris.""
As a true Morillas, it can confidently be labeled, as the fragrance in the second phase features finely intertwined notes. Compared to ""Nylaia,"" which came to mind, there are no scent similarities. Even though ""Tears of Iris"" returns after a short dip, ""Nylaia"" has more radiance; positively put, ""Tears of Iris"" remains much softer and closer to the skin.
Do you know the Harry Potter episode ""The Order of the Phoenix""? The beautiful phoenix can heal with its tears until it turns to ash again, only to rise once more.
Overall, I quite like the fragrance, but I shed a small tear for the beautiful iris at the beginning; thus, the name ""Tears of Iris"" resonates with me personally very well ;-)
P.S.: After many, many hours (yes, I can still smell it ;-) the iris mixes in more clearly again. There remains a light sweetness reminiscent of grape sugar-fruit, as I already know from ""Magnum Iris"" or ""Silver Iris."""
Moonlight Serenade,04/29/2019,Gandix,F,181,,36,More than just Lavender,"Well, those who know me know that I hardly ever like lavender, actually I prefer it in the garden and not as a fragrance.
But this is so completely different.
The opening is like running your hands through a huge lavender bush.
Very, very authentic.
Even I, as a non-lavender fan, have to give it respect.
It's also quite powerful.
Fortunately for me, unfortunately for lavender lovers, it quickly pulls back.
I don't specifically smell sage.
And then this change comes along.
Everything is already quiet and still, calming, just as lavender is said to be.
A beautiful, subtly vanillic tonka bean joins in very gently, with a breeze of musk
and I would say, there's also a tiny pinch of amber.
The herbs are still present, albeit very subdued,
and give the whole thing a wonderful spiciness.
One could almost think there's a hint of the pepperiness of delicate feather carnations in there.
But I must emphasize, everything is happening very, very close to the skin.
I am practically hanging my nose on my wrist,
to smell more and more of this wonderful scent.
It's a fragrance that you don't really perceive as a perfume, but rather just as a
""This person smells good"".
It's a scent that I would confidently wear for a visit to a hospital,
without disturbing anyone.
It's a fragrance that would gently lull the person opposite during a job interview, without him/her noticing.
Actually, it's meant to be layered with the other scents in this series,
but I would consider it too precious for that.
It's far too quiet to assert itself against something else
and I simply wouldn't want to mess it up.
You can't just spray this scent quickly in a perfumery for testing,
you need a lot of calm and leisure,
to explore it.
And you might need a bit more of it.
Then it becomes a very, very interesting journey.
It has pleasantly surprised me.
A Morillas, indeed.
Aaaaand, those who like it powerful will be disappointed. And also, those looking for a lavender scent will be disappointed after 10 minutes.
I am thrilled."
Gucci № 3,10/23/2015,Cumulnimbus,F,119,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Autumn in tweed and leather,"I'm wearing today this incredible perfume and had to write about it. I really think it is one of the most perfect autumn perfumes I've come across. When I smell it, it makes me long for countryside walks, in woolen jumpers and coats, and leather boots of course. Tweed and leather, those good old things.

Green chypre, full of oakmoss, narcissus, leather, rubbery tuberose and a hint of dense red rose. Aldehydes give a sparkling effect to it, but they are under control. So the result is creamy, green, animalic, autumnal but still shiny.

Very chic and uncommon to today’s commonplace for scents. Strong and long lasting too. Worths every cent of the edt, I own too a perfume extrait which is even better, to cry for actually. Why next generations have to be punished not to ever smell it, I will never understand.

Pure magic."
Gucci № 3,11/28/2011,Medusa00,F,841,,26,"My 400th Review, a Tribute","For days I pondered which fragrance to dedicate my 400th review to. I didn't want to write a critique for this occasion. But thanks to a dear perfume enthusiast, I have a sample of Gucci 3 (Extrait). Now, where better to sing praises than with a lovely Chypre? However, I must note that not all Chypres automatically win me over. There are Chypres I wouldn't even want to be embalmed with when I'm dead.
Ah yes, Gucci 3 is from the past, and it smells like it too. But I don't belong to those who claim that everything was better back then. Many things were different, some better, some also crap... Fragrances from the past were better than other fragrances from the past and sometimes even better than some from today.
Gucci 3 is a scent for big girls, those whose eggshells behind their ears have already come off, or for a lively grandma who rides motorcycles with her grandson, treats herself to stylish clothes, or travels the world. I don't mean the lady over 60 who, as I often hear from my clients of that age, says: ""Oh, Mrs. ... that's all very nice, but I don't need anything anymore, I already have everything."" Just the other day, I would have liked to ask the permanently permed lady (at most 65 years young) if she has already paid for her burial plot. Well, they don't wear perfume anyway.
Gucci 3 is a dark, floral-spicy Chypre that starts with a concentrated dose of aldehydes, but NOT in a soapy form. It immediately gives way to a dense spice note that can't solely come from coriander. The floral flood in the heart is so complex, opulent, and not sweet that I can't identify a single note. For all those who fear fragrances from the 1980s, I can say: Opulent: Yes! An 80s bomb? No!
The base is (for all Chypre fans) worship-worthy. A fine leather note, dark and warm, ambered, elegantly woody. I will keep an eye on Gucci 3; I have a lot, but not everything that brings me joy."
Gucci № 3,08/14/2011,Chanelle,F,752,,18,Gucci's Showcase Chypre,"Guccio Gucci, who, like Thierry Hermès, originally sold fine saddles and leather goods, stood for me as the epitome of style and quality, just like his label founded in the 1950s. Gucci as a corporation has had its ups and downs, like almost every other fashion house, and after a major crisis, it managed to get back on its feet with the help of Tom Ford, even becoming more profitable than before.
But - at what price? Gucci, the label, may play a significant role internationally again - but if Guccio, the father of the label, could smell what is marketed today under his name, he would be turning in his grave.
Not so with Gucci No.3! This fragrance deserves the recognition that I also have for early Gucci items: It meets a high standard, is an absolute noble chypre, a signature candidate, and - timeless.
Unfortunately, it is hardly available nowadays, as it was discontinued years ago during the restructuring within the corporation.
The best always go first.
After a green-aldehydic opening, the fragrance quickly becomes warmer, silkier, slightly fruity, and even has a minimal resemblance to Mitsouko in the heart note, although without the peach and without a distinct presence of a single floral note. The base is skillfully balanced, a leathery note amidst a bouquet of oak moss, fine woods, and amber, radiant and vibrant. A fragrance like a silk scarf, like a buttery soft leather bag, like handcrafted shoes. Luxury that one loves for a lifetime."
Gucci № 3,02/25/2015,Leimbacher,M,2870,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,20,"If you tip over, that would be silly","Such an old Chypre treasure,
you are worth more than a simple chat!

Your beginning may have tipped for sure,
but in the end, you really pulled it off once more.

You’ve proven to me once again,
Gucci back then spared neither forest nor meadows,
rightly belonged to the olfactory giants,
offering no fragrances like today, at best good enough to lease!

You couldn’t smell more like the 80s,
even John Rambo would crawl before you.

Full of moss, forest, flowers, meadows & brush,
you belong in the executive suite, driving every boss mad.

Whether aldehydes, iris, bergamot, or amber,
you adorned even the brightest stars with dark Ramba Zamba.

Is it the patch, the moss, or just the leather?
You’re something like Jil Sanders Man Pure - not everyone liked you.

Slowly you then departed from us,
only then did the mourners sing slowly.

Are you the boss, and that as a woman,
wear this little water - and you often hear Wow!"
Gucci № 3,09/11/2017,Serenissima,F,1222,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,12,"Verona, Romeo and Juliet and a Duck as a Supporting Actor","Few of my fragrances felt just right to accompany me to Italy for a few weeks like ""Gucci N° 3"".
First of all, the former saddlery managed to create a great masterpiece with this scent; secondly, at that time I still didn't own the ""Voyage"" version of Cartier's ""Panthère"", which was my constant companion back then.
Even with my always very extensive luggage, it would have been audacious to lug the heavy crystal bottle in the red leather case.
So ""Gucci N° 3"" accompanied me to Northern Italy.

This fragrance is also a child of its time: a rich chypre of noble craftsmanship.
In the opening with aldehydes, bergamot, and other green components, it resembles many of its fragrant contemporaries. -At that moment, a good acquaintance greets me.
The floral heart note is of particular olfactory richness. Alone, jasmine, lily of the valley, and rose cast their spell. Together with daffodil, rich tuberose, and the iris root, which I always find a bit unusual, all senses are already fully engaged.
A heavy, sensual base (initially dominated by musk and leather) is completed by amber, oakmoss, and other spices. These round off this fragrance creation to perfection.
""Gucci N° 3"" floats full, harmonious, and mysterious, surrounding one for a long time with its unique charm.
Only after many hours does a still light trace remain.

Thus, ""Gucci N° 3"" was a lovely companion during my stay in Abano Terme. And of course, it couldn't be missing in Verona.
Instead of using the bus rides to the opera performances in the arena, I had pre-ordered tickets directly from the organizer and also reserved a hotel room in the city.
I didn't just want to experience the arena on the picturesque Piazza Brà; I wanted to indulge myself with a bit more time in this city.
The evening performance of ""Tosca"" was very successful. The security measures at this major event didn't bother me as a West Berliner: that was familiar to me. One of the heavily armed police officers even carried the two rented cushions behind me.
What a sight that must have been! First the usher, then me, all dressed up for the evening, and behind me the heavily armed man with the two green cushions!
These things later kept the poor gentleman sitting behind me busy: he had to keep picking up the cushion, originally meant for the back. He did it patiently and kindly!
(As my mother often used to say: Can you manage without all the fuss?)
The night was clear and correspondingly cool. But precisely because of that, the stars shone particularly bright during ""E lucevan le Stelle""!

The next day was dedicated to a more extensive exploration of the city until my taxi driver arrived in the afternoon.
My first stop, of course, was the house of Romeo and the Casa di Giulietta in Via Capella.
I too stood in the courtyard and looked up at Juliet's balcony; touched by the tragedy of young love.
But of course, I asked myself: who were these two young people?
Created solely by William Shakespeare (or was it Christopher Marlowe)?
Or do they live in each of us? Doesn't every Juliet in us seek her very own Romeo?

However, I also wondered: how could Juliet's nurse keep complaining about her aching feet? The distance between the houses isn't that far.
In the end, I concluded that it wasn't the distance and frequency of the trips that caused the pain. No, it was surely the very bad road paving back then!
Because every woman who went to the arena in her summer shoes had to take those shoes to the cobbler the next day.
During the season in Verona, the cobblers in Abano Terme had their high season.

Those who have made it this far will rightly ask: what about the duck?
Yes, this duck appeared on stage in August 1994.
The summer was very hot; the open-air stage at Spandau Citadel had ""Romeo & Juliet"", performed by the ""Spandauer Vagantenbühne"", on the program. So: off we go!
Even that evening, despite the heat, I wore ""Gucci N° 3"": it was simply part of ""Romeo and Juliet"".
This rustic location is situated on a peninsula, surrounded on three sides by the Havel, lined with reeds. Therefore, the performances there also include various waterfowl as constantly changing extras.
The evening was still very warm, it was quite crowded, and a slightly shortened, somewhat parodied version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" delighted the audience; it would surely have pleased ""Master Shakespeare"" as well.
But apparently not all viewers: after the intermission, it was much emptier - not a disaster in the heat.
From the reeds, the waterfowl could be heard: the bright whistling of the coots, the ducks telling each other their goodnight stories. They formed a completely natural sound backdrop.
On the forest-fringed stage stood a scaffolding with a platform and a suggested balcony: Juliet's house.
The older lady behind me asked reluctantly: ""What is that bundle of rags up there?""
The family flinched, part of the audience chuckled audibly: this bundle of rags held Romeo and Juliet!
The heart-wrenching scene began: Romeo put on his shirt and Juliet desperately asked:
""Are you already leaving? The day is still far off! It was the nightingale and not the lark!""

She didn't get to the lark. A duck had finished its own evening ritual and loudly announced itself: ""Quack-quack-quack-quack!!"" echoed across the open-air stage!
First, there was stunned silence - then very loud laughter!
Romeo and Juliet stood helplessly on their scaffolding. The beauty of the scene was destroyed: by a duck! The audience was rolling with laughter - those two up there had lost the thread!
It took several minutes before Romeo, somewhat dejected, finally left his Juliet and the tragedy took its course.
The final applause was loud and grateful, still interspersed with soft giggles.
It was an entirely successful evening!
(If that had been foreseeable, the RTL cameraman would surely have stayed!)

Since then, for me, ""Romeo and Juliet"", whether in image or sound, (and of course also ""Shakespeare in Love"") is accompanied by the fragrant memory of ""Gucci N° 3"" - and of course also a duck!
Feel free to call me an art philistine - no one can take this vivid memory away from me!"
Gucci № 3,06/16/2022,Minigolf,F,2512,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,14,Heroic Courage in the Shift Knob!,"What have I cursed about numerous ""modern"" Gucci fragrances. Much of it is mass-produced, mainstream, ""crowd-pleasing,"" all sorts of little-known ""waters"" that come and go.
But the ""older models"" more than make up for these disappointments! The older ""Guilty,"" a poem for herb-rough floral scents, the older ""Pour Homme,"" a skillfully distinctive fougère.
And this one here, unfortunately long discontinued, which is a highly masterful example of a ""full chypre.""
As mentioned by some of my ""predecessors,"" the Italian Gucci company's journey began similarly to that of ""Hermès."" With leather goods and saddles and other equestrian supplies. Then came travel accessories, watches, jewelry, and FRAGRANCES.
The fragrances were probably a small business risk at the time, because besides Gucci and Hermes, a whole range of fashion, jewelry, watch, car, design companies, jewelers, and other ""fragrance-foreign"" businesses also ventured into fragrances.
And ""Gucci"" certainly showed some ""heroic courage in the shift knob"" in this regard!
And one of these masterpieces is ""Gucci N°3,"" created by ""Firmenich's"" perfumers. In this true ""full chypre,"" you can still smell the quality of the ingredients and their refined combination even after a long time. Without compromising the top, heart, or base notes. But wonderfully ""aged"" in honor, which makes it so magnificent.
With the first ""spray,"" a wonderfully green-spicy citrus fruit-laden, slightly aldehyde-enhanced strong top note emerges, hinting at all the ""delights"" that may follow.
A floral, slightly herb-sweet ""tumult"" of aromas finds its place, all contributing to a cheerful ""commotion."" With fine edges and corners. A long projection is a matter of honor. However, it never becomes overly pompous or intrusive. Because none of the aromas is ""too much.""
A slow transition to the ""base"" still allows ""head and heart"" to be clearly recognized, nothing is overshadowed or displaced. It is always just another addition to what is already there when bitter, woody, grassy-earthy, and true oak moss facets join in. This now ""complete"" scent endures for hours, lively, almost tactile, and transformable in a magnificent manner! Beautiful!!!!"
Gucci № 3,05/06/2010,Kittycat,F,280,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Gucci No. 3 - it's been a while,"""Gucci No. 3"" was my second fragrance that I owned, or rather the first perfume that I bought for myself. Before that, I always used mini bottles of ""Charlie"" by Revlon, which I received as gifts from time to time.
Just a side note.
This fragrance is a solid Chypre, as it is no longer produced or created today. The floral notes are rather green and herbaceous, with a woody base. The aldehydes provide a certain lightness, making it feel less heavy than other Chypre fragrances.
A scent that you don't get tired of quickly.
Unfortunately, it is probably no longer in production :-("
Gucci № 3,01/21/2024,Lauser93,M,1199,,3,A Quite Solid Women's Fragrance,"Now I have another vintage miniature to test. Gucci № 3 is quite nice so far, but it doesn't blow me away. The longevity is quite good at around 8 to 9 hours, while the sillage is a bit weaker.

The top note starts aldehydic, green, herbal, and fruity thanks to bergamot and coriander. The heart note offers a sea of flowers consisting of lily of the valley, daffodils, jasmine blossoms, rose water, iris, violets, and tuberose. The base feels quite overloaded and smells earthy, rooty, leathery, animalic, woody, balsamic, and forest-like. I detect oak moss, musk, vetiver, and patchouli.

This is an old-school chypre that, in the end, didn't ""catch"" me. Therefore, my miniature will move on."
Flora by Gucci Gracious Tuberose,10/07/2012,Coutureguru,M,237,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Buttery Springtime,"Flora by Gucci Gracious Tuberose is a lovely surprise!! I bought it unsniffed from inflight duty free a few nights ago and can't stop wearing it!

This Tuberose is definitely gracious (as it's name implies) ... a note that has the reputation for misbehaviour in most fragrances containing it has been tamed beautifully here. Fresh up top, the Rose and Orange Blossom combination with the Tuberose in the heart is utterly inspired. A 'buttery' green effect is immediately evident ... which is all at once surprising, but very interesting too. I also get a substantial resiny Cedar as this fragance dries down.
Gracious Tuberose has good sillage and slightly more than average longevity, lingering for at least 6 hours on my skin, even in the tropical weather I currently find myself in. I've had more than one compliment over the last few days ... always a good indication that something is doing the job it's supposed to!

I seldom wear anything that smells 'fresh' ... Gracious Tuberose delivers springtime in a bottle without feeling like a slap of eau de cologne ... simply lovely!!"
Flora by Gucci Gracious Tuberose,05/07/2012,ArkangeL,M,156,HELPFUL REVIEW,1,Sheer Tuberose,"The Flora Garden collection is not as magnificent as Mugler's Garden of Stars, but Tuberose is my favorite out of the line-up. Unfortunately, Violet and Mandarin are the sisters that were separated from the others at birth (when launched) due to exclusivity. So, I can't say how I feel about them yet. Tuberose is not anything like Michael Kors or Fracas. Its a white floral with shared attention on green notes. Very light, airy and sheer. When I smell this, I think of Miss Dior Cherie L'eau. Another fresh, white to green floral, composed of bigarade orange, white musk, caramel and patchouli. Quite classy."
Flora by Gucci Gracious Tuberose,02/24/2019,Cumulnimbus,F,119,,1,Green and transparent tuberose,"Transparent, fresh and almost green flower bouquet water. Diluted and inoffensive tuberose and orange flowers, turned green through the addition of watery violet leaves and dewy white roses. Cedar is noticeable in the drydown. The peach is very subtle, fresh and not dominating at all. The freshest tuberose perfume in my collection around my favourite flower, it is very clean and refreshing, pretty easy to wear, with an almost minimal style that matches a white simple white dress and a polished ponytail for a warm summer morning. Not avant garde, uncomplicatedly contemporary. Moderate sillage and 4 to 5 hours longevity."
Flora by Gucci Gracious Tuberose,05/09/2017,loewenherz,M,916,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,13,Queen of Spades,"Sometimes I think with great enthusiasm about the strangest things - some of them for many years. I come from a family where card games are quite popular - so 'real' card games, not something like Uno or Mau-Mau - and even as a boy, I sometimes wondered how the boys, queens, and kings might look outside the well-known cutout. (I was also preoccupied with news anchors in a similar way, but that faded away eventually.)

My all-time favorite among the face cards is the Queen of Spades. In the game of Doppelkopf, a Queen of Spades is not a bad playing card either, but I always found her 'other' appearance particularly interesting. She is the only queen in the so-called 'French' deck that is shown in profile - and unlike the Queen of Clubs, Hearts, and Diamonds, she is the only one who does not smile. When the French deck is used for oracle purposes, the Queen of Spades is considered 'the foreign woman' - one who is opaque and mysterious.

She also wears less jewelry than the others - pearls and a simple bracelet - and appears overall a bit 'less polished'. She wears a dress (or just a top - who knows?) in the colors of Italy - her green cloak is trimmed with fur. The flower in her hand - to which she is inclined, but seems not to really smell - is usually a red tulip, sometimes a rose in older card games. Everything about her seems a little harsher than the other queens - a bit more serious and less sweet.

The tuberose is one of the polarizing floral accords - and one that I, who quite enjoys ignoring the often arbitrary distinction between women's and men's fragrances, perceive as rather feminine. There is something fleshy about it and something sensual and mature, with little youthful quality. And despite the playful opening of peach and bright flowers, Gucci's 'gracious tuberose' carries the same seriousness and maturity that pleasantly distinguishes the Queen of Spades from the others.

Conclusion: a mature almost soliflore of at most medium strength. And whatever one might not love about tuberose, Gucci's Gracious Tuberose has surprisingly little of that. And while I will probably never find out how the Queen of Spades looks 'down below' - I am quite sure she wears this scent."
Flora by Gucci Gracious Tuberose,07/20/2016,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,5,gracious brightness,"Even early in the morning, the air in the bedroom was still, and the radio host announced a hot day.

So, I wanted to choose a fragrance that is as transparent as possible, without heaviness - but with a certain expression.

I don't want to smell citrusy, but still bright and fresh.
Gracious Tuberose seems to be the perfect choice!

Gracious - according to Leo: gracious, kind, elegant.
I find the adjective ""elegant"" to be the most fitting.

The intro is soft and delicately tart with peach and violet - but gains summery brightness through the orange blossom and the prominent tuberose.
The impression is radiant white.
Slightly softened, the snow white is complemented by mild woody notes.

The fragrance remains feather-light - fortunately, it is not overly fleeting, but stays perceptible for a long time.

Although not necessarily a summer scent, the gracious tuberose is also well wearable in heat.
Of course, it fits into other seasons as well.

A pleasant fragrance, with subtle elegance, that skillfully adapts to the wearer and the temperatures."
Guilty Absolu de Parfum pour Homme,11/04/2025,Mitty2415,M,2,,2,Great designer fragrance,"From open to close this is a work of art, orange blossom and almond hit you hard off the rip giving a sweet and just a touch of bitter feel to it, its creamy and seductive, sophisticated and mature. The projection is great and sillage is wonderful, as it dries down you get more of the leather and wood and settles into a glorious mellow man smell. nnIt checks all the boxes for me, this is my first 10/10 fragrance the only downside is price of designer fragrances hitting over 200 for 2 oz, they keep going up. But it’s such a well made fragrance get a decant and try out for winter and fall it’s sexy!!"
Guilty Absolu de Parfum pour Homme,10/08/2025,Eliseoo,M,12,,1,"Okay, Bisch, I'm impressed.","This is like the Elixir if it wasn't muddled with sweetness and actually had some thought put into it.

The opening is very similar to the Elixir, if it had a softer vanilla and was less in your face. Sadly the rum note isn't as boozy or prominent as I hoped it would be, but that is completely okay as the tonka bean makes up for it in the dry down.

They really microdosed the labdanum, chili, and leather notes, definitely supporting notes that do make the fragrance darker and do a really good job at it. I will include, that if you're here for the chili note, Guilty EDP is the best one for that. It is a lot softer and less nuanced here. Now for the tonka bean, the almond amplifies the tonka bean and I could even detect some cherry facets.

The base really completes it with the multifaceted tonka bean and benzoin, they pair really well, in the air its a very delicious and rich smell.

This is 100% a modern and safe release, however what I'm impressed by is the complexity of the tonka bean, which is almost never seen in designer releases. As a Gucci Guilty fan, this is by far the best one in the line. Is it as unique and bold as the original Gucci Guilty Absolute? No, but it performs better and can be worn a lot more. This a great take on modern sweet DNAs with a dark spicy twist, and I respect it for being that way."
Guilty Absolu de Parfum pour Homme,09/03/2025,Jeffrey03,M,24,,10,An elixir de parfum that didn't need a successor!,"Even though I'm not particularly into the game when it comes to older designer fragrances like Dior or Chanel, I have managed to try quite a few over time and found my favorite designer scent in Gucci Guilty Elixir, the ""predecessor fragrance"" to this one.

Since I work at the airport, I was able to try the new Gucci Guilty Absolu de Parfum at the Duty Free today, hopeful that I might find a new designer fragrance for myself.

At first sniff, the scent struck me as quite spicy; some unlisted pepperiness didn't appeal to me much. After a few minutes, the classic EDP DNA comes through, albeit riper, more mature, and niche-like, with more edges and not as ""youthful"" as the predecessor, but unfortunately, I liked nearly every aspect of that one. After a short while, I feel like I can better distinguish individual notes. I get an interesting sharpness from the chili and also a slight boozy rum note. Overall, as mentioned, the scent is more mature, edgier, niche-like, and in my perception, a bit spicier than the EDP, which unfortunately makes me like it less.

In my opinion, the EDP from Gucci didn't need any change, or at least not in this direction. I had hoped that I would like the ADP better, but unfortunately, that is not the case; nonetheless, the new interpretation is interesting.

I can't comment on longevity and sillage, as I only tried the scent once for a while on my wrist, where it held up and also seemed quite strong, so I assume that, similar to the EDP, it has some power! The bottle is nicely made; the price-performance ratio remains to be seen, as the EDP has also become cheaper over time, and the MSRP is quite a number! If you like the EDP, you might want to test this one and form your own opinion!"
Accenti,10/13/2023,MrsGuerlain,F,548,,5,Always in my heart,"Apart from smelling amazing this scent is from the same year as my son was born. I did not meet it before 2003, though, when I went on a vacation to Florence. One of the cities on my ‘to visit’-list at that time. Now on my ‘to visit again’-list.
This city is full of historic places, and having just a weekend I had to be pickish with my choices. My first priority was to go to the Uffizi Gallery, but when I arrived, there was a sign stating that the waiting time was two hours for visitors who had ordered tickets in advance. For others - four hours. I decided not to spend so much precious time of my short vacation on standing in line. Instead I went for a stroll down the narrow, curvy alleys, heading for the Dome, Cattedrale de Santa Maria del Fiore.
While walking there and knowing that the oldest perfume shop in Europe is located in Florence, I thought that maybe this would be something to do instead of looking at art. Going on a perfume shop hunt. I had an example of ‘The trip goes to Florence’ in my hand - this was before the smartphones - and started my journey looking at the map of the inner city.
It was a wonderful walk. And in one of these small streets without cars I found a small ‘Profumo & Pharmaceutica’. I went in and was greeted by the most friendly and service minded person ever. She did not speak more than two words of English and my Italian was limited to ‘Mille Grazie’ but it did not matter. I told her I was looking for a new scent - ‘nova prufomo’, I think I said, and we ended up spending two hours trying scents and having a blast. She kept saying ‘good?’ and I kept saying no or yes. Finally I ended up buying Accenti. When I left the shop, I had forgotten all about the Lady of the Flower’s beautiful church. I went there the next day.
Accenti has a special place in my memory, my nose and my heart. It has made it to my top 20. For some years it was my signature scent. It is a marvelous perfume, powerful and unique. I love the way it keeps changing, sometimes it is the rose, sometimes the peach, sometimes the jasmine in front. It reminds me of this particular trip to Florence, this pocket of time in which I walked around the beautiful city and felt the breeze of history. Accenti has an Italian feeling to it. Thank you, Dominique Ropion, for making this.

Accenti,02/02/2012,Lola82,F,361,,3,Big Florientals Swan Song,"It's chic sexy and demands your attention
the typical 90's glamor transitional era
when Calvin Klein introduced us with the
first unisex fragrance CK One and still
we were going though wanning years of the
big orientals of the 80's i.e like Obsession Poison
Red Door & Giorgio of Beverly hills Red
accenti reflects that swan song of the big florienals before the tread for lighter watery florals.

It opens with a sweet and a bit tart of
raspberry in a few minutes dries to an note of tangerine and peach the drying down turns to a powdery vanilla with nuance of tonka bean and a big heap of Sandalwood. the florals like the Rose
Jasmine and Lily of the Valley are very hard to detect sadly overshadowed from their louder siblings the sandalwood
raspberry vanilla and peach;

It's intoxicating richness that is an
jewel in perfumery that is sadly going to be missed."
Accenti,02/05/2022,Lolalibertin,F,22,,3,Smells like cold marble hall within a fruit garden,"It is indeed sweet and fruity, and has a light oriental vibe, but still not fully oriental to my nose. Very interesting composition. Might be cloying if sprayed on the skin with wrong chemitry. But i have found an ultimate twin to this one: ""Bogner woman III"" (discontinued and hard to get). Bogner smells even more intense and more fruity, it lacks that tonka-raspberry combination, that might be unpleasant to someone. Back to Accenti: still great Gucci from 90´s with great sillage and lasting power."
Accenti,12/07/2019,Drseid,M,828,,1,The Great Dominique Ropion Strikes Again...,"Accenti opens with a splash of clean, slightly aldehydic mandarin orange with hints of peach before moving to its heart. As the composition enters its early heart, the moderately sweet peach takes the fore, joined by a co-starring floral trio of almost plum-like honeyed jasmine, soft, airy rose and clean lily-of-the-valley, with the fading mandarin staying just detectable in support, pairing with slightly powdery vanilla and moderately sweet sandalwood rising from the base. During the late dry-down, the slightly sweet sandalwood and gentle dusty vanilla take the fore, with remnants of the peach remaining in support through the finish as the florals vacate. Projection is average and longevity above average at around 10 hours on skin.

Let's cut to the chase... Ropion has created a masterwork with Accenti. I am not a peach fan in compositions at all, but it is impossible not to be intoxicated with its masterful use in Accenti; coupled perfectly with the complex honeyed Dior Poison-like jasmine, airy rose and relatively clean, slightly indolic lily-of-the-valley floral trio. The sandalwood and vanilla are also used deftly, adding moderately sweet grounding to the peach-laced florals, then providing a well-integrated soft landing through the finish as they gradually take the fore. The composition from top-to-bottom smells absolutely incredible, with no note or accord seeming out of place, all melding together perfectly. The bottom line is the sadly discontinued $200+ per 100ml bottle on the aftermarket Accenti is some of Dominique Ropion's finest work and well worth seeking out even at its current lofty aftermarket price point earning an ""outstanding"" 4.5 stars out of 5 and a super-strong recommendation."
Accenti,04/21/2018,Thatsmr2usir,M,67,,2,Great 90's frag!!,"What a great old school, fruity, non apologetic fragrance that was created in the 90's but could have very well been manufactured in the 80's do to it's loud opening as many 80's fragrances were designed. This starts off with peach, raspberries & floral notes of rose & I also get some white floral as well.

There is vanilla, sandalwood & tonka in the base to add depth to the fragrance. It is a well balanced fragrance especially for a mass marketed designer brand. This opens up loud, heady & projects very well for the first 1-2 hours. And it last at least 8 hours on me as I am referring to the EDT. This is nothing short of a feminine fragrance. I for one hate to classify fragrances to the men/women category as I wear whatever works for my skin regardless whom it is marketed towards, tho I cannot help shake the feeling this is more suited towards the dames.

It is a shame that Gucci discontinued this beauty as this was when Gucci as a perfume house WAS one of the best in the mass market designer game. Since the fall of Gucci Envy for men, this house has taken a downward spiral into the gates of hell with it's current creations which are uninspiring & non pleasing to my nose. The great Tom Ford helped this house ALOT when he worked for them, but once he left, it was curtains & mini blinds for Gucci!"

Accenti,01/13/2019,FlirtyFlower,F,81,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,25,Illuminati - The Bookshelf,"When the young woman crosses my path, I feel as if someone has turned off the light in her eyes. The glow, the life, the unbearable lightness of being. Her gaze not only reminds me of a zombie but also of a person with a bowel obstruction.

But what happened that brought everything to this point?

As I stand in front of my fragrance shelf in the evening, I am almost overcome by a moral scent hangover when I encounter Gucci Accenti, one of my former loyal fragrance companions, again.

What was it like back when I was still a little scent punk? I sprayed myself with all sorts of things. Only those vintage fragrances were so strong back then that one could feel as if being gassed by this atomic bomb sillage.

But with the spraying of this fragrance, all sorts of other memories awaken in me.

All I can say is tonka bean. But I had forgotten for years what tonka bean even smelled like... It is somehow powdery, fruity, and then comes this vintage touch. But how does one explain vintage as a scent?

Like a bad omen, I also recall the funeral blues by W.H. Auden from my bookshelf:

Stop all the clocks,
Cut off the telephone.
Prevent the dog from barking
With a silent key.
Silence the pianos
And with muffled drum
Bring out the coffin.

Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead
Scribbling on the sky
He is gone.

He was my North, my South,
My East and West.
My Sunday rest
And my week’s stress.
My talk, my song,
My day, my night.
I thought love would last forever:
Wrong, I was wrong.

You stars are not wanted now;
Put out every one.
Pack up the moon
And dismantle the sun.
Pour away the ocean
And sweep"

Accenti,12/27/2012,Apollonia,F,4,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Gucci Makes a Statement,"I can only agree with my predecessors. It is truly incomprehensible that this fragrance is no longer being produced, as it is really something very special and in no way a generic scent.
Unfortunately, I only own a sample, which is already half empty.

On my skin, I primarily detect spicy and floral notes, which is why I perceive the scent as slightly diva-like; that is to say, I think it suits confident women who like to stand out, but still prefer to be subtle rather than obvious. It gives one a beautiful feminine, sensual aura without being intrusive. In my opinion, Accenti is a fragrance for women between 25 and 50 who want to emphasize their self-confidence and zest for life.

For me, it is one of the best fragrances I have ever tested."
Guilty Love Edition pour Homme,05/03/2025,Moonrock79,M,5,,2,Heavenly smell,"When I blind bought my JPG Flower Edition back then, I was really worried.
Because I’ve never owned a floral based perfume before, so I was nervously anticipating to try it.
The day came when it arrived and oh boy!
It was love at first spray! And I knew I would be hunting for more floral based scents.

Now for the Guilty Love Edition.
This starts off very fresh on me.
Not out of the shower fresh but more clean like a very expensive floral soap.
Then the full strenght of the floral and sweetness quickly add on top of the clean/fresh scent. The scent becomes unisex at this paticular point for me.
The dry down is just heavenly and exhilarating! Clean, (a faint minty) creamy, floral, a bit powdery and soft sweetness.
It gives an elegant, beautiful and a really good happy vibe.
I also think the orange blossom provides quite a character.

This perfume smells very unique and high quality to me.
I’m definitely going to buy another bottle for backup.

I had this on today. 3 sprays for testing. One on the collarbone, one on the back of my neck and one on my wrist. It was 15 degrees celcius but cloudy and rather windy. I was occasionally getting a whiff of the scent, whenever the wind shifted.
When I was indoors, the scent stayed constantly and I would say that the sillage was an arms lenght and leaves a good scent trail.

The longevity was 9+ hours on my skin.
Worth mentioning is that I have a very dry skin.
I use NUXE Huile Prodigieuse Multi Purpose Dry Oil Face Body Hair Spray on my upper body daily before I go out.
So the longevity on my perfumes get a tad bit longer on me.
I think women can easily wear this too.
I definitely would not mind it on my wife.
I would be constantly sniffing her, but that’s another story…lol"
Guilty Love Edition pour Homme,01/29/2025,Felixthreeon,M,1,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,White florals done right,"Spectacular release. It is like an eau fraiche of the elixir, with good performance. Easily the better of the two in warmer situations, and this thing generates positive reactions from people like nothing I've ever seen. If you like white florals, this is one of the more modern masculine-leaning interpretations. I would put this squarely in the MYSLF ballpark, but that is more feminine-leaning. This one is the grand slam, and MYSLF (both iterations) are the runner picked off at first base. I believe this is a limited edition, as well. Either way, it is a LOVE for me."
Guilty Love Edition pour Homme,09/27/2025,RudiMentaer,M,9,,1,Forever Young,"I'll say it right away and without preamble: The color of the bottle does not lie. The scent is truly nothing less.

You can clearly recognize the Guilty line. But this one is fresher, more synthetic, creamier, fruitier, and a bit less floral than Guilty pour Homme EAU DE PARFUM or Guilty Parfum pour Homme. It is quite loud, but of course not as potent as Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Homme. The orange blossoms also shine wonderfully here.

Who likes it?

I see a young man in spring. In great spirits, sun-kissed, fashionably dressed, and with a mischievous glint in his eye.

Who doesn't like it?

More mature gentlemen, who find their happiness in fougère or cardamom, might feel a bit out of place here.

How good that I have been 20 for over 30 years…

I've read several times that many buy the brand just because they want to be someone they are not.

""Maybe there's something to that,"" I thought to myself this morning.
Then I applied it and adjusted my sunglasses.

""I am young.""
""I live in Florence.""
""What does the world cost?""
""I am Gucci!"""
Guilty Love Edition pour Homme,03/12/2025,ComputerMaus,M,264,,6,Valentine's Day for Him and Her,"I better take another look at the packaging. Yes, indeed. ""pour Homme"" is written there. However, Guilty Love Edition pour Homme EAU DE PARFUM is so unisex, it almost leans towards the feminine, that one can hardly believe their eyes, or rather their nose.

Upon spraying, the fragrance starts with a synthetic, indefinable freshness (could that be juniper? Please...), but quickly becomes sweet and, above all, incredibly floral-creamy. The orange blossom is absolutely at the center here, supported in the first hour by a slightly sharp fresh note (and at this point still somewhat related to the Guilty pour Homme EAU DE TOILETTE DNA), but over time it becomes tamer and more affectionate. A super cuddly, friendly scent.
However, so much amiability is also relatively unsexy. So it's not a fragrance for a first date, but one for a solid partnership and certainly ideal for a cozy evening for two in spring or summer. But it also suits gatherings with friends and (innocent) parties.
Well-made floral fragrances that can also be worn by men have always captivated me. I love Sunshine Man and ""Fleur du Mâle | Jean Paul Gaultier,"" and Guilty Love Edition pour Homme EAU DE PARFUM reminds me a bit of the latter, although even softer, less masculine, and even less bitter.

The floral scent projects well for 2 hours and then fades, but lasts almost 9 hours. Quite decent. And long enough to fill a Valentine's afternoon. Oh, what a pity that Valentine's Day is already over this year. Such a perfectly fitting fragrance for it."
Flora by Gucci Glamorous Magnolia,12/18/2012,Callas,F,187,,16,Winning Scent,"Yes, it is my giveaway scent and it has won as well.
I had to wait a few days and, a bit hesitantly, I sprayed the glamorous magnolia. I don't usually like it too floral, but I was very pleasantly surprised.
The green notes leave a smile on my face.
FGM starts very dry, slightly bitter, with a paired sweetness of the freesia, which is subtle enough for me.
I confess that I don't really know the scent of magnolia. I do have one in my front yard, but since it is very young, it doesn't emit such a powerful magnolia scent in spring yet. According to some minor research, the scent of magnolia is simulated through artificial means. Essences of rose, jasmine, neroli, ylang-ylang, and synthetic aroma substances are used for imitation.

I find the further scent development fruity, and green still plays a good supporting role. I experience a tingling in my nose; something is happening here. Spring fizz?
FGM is marketed as a spring fragrance, which is understandable, as the magnolia takes the lead here. However, this is not so relevant for me.
Today would be a day, for example, when I could very well imagine the scent on my skin. Although it is winter, the thermometer showed about 10 degrees today.

The base note develops woody, still bitter green. The sweetness has become even more subtle.
I can sense a hint of chocolate, but probably only because it appears in the pyramid. So, gourmand lovers, you will be disappointed here.

I like the scent and am still happy that I was able to win it thanks to parfumo.

Addendum from the internet: “Magnolia scent inspires the imagination and stimulates creative creation.”

Well then, I’ll spray some........

Speaking of spraying; the longevity is average to good. I only sprayed subtly. That was a good three hours ago, and I can still perceive the scent well. The sillage is rather subtle."
Flora by Gucci Glamorous Magnolia,08/21/2015,FlirtyFlower,F,81,,12,Kissed by Schoooooooookolade....,"Actually, I wasn't in the mood to start a new fragrance flirt. I was just going on vacation and didn't really have much money.

To my dismay, I had forgotten my then-signature scent J’adore at home. Well, okay - 20 euros - that was the maximum I could spend on a fragrance flirt from the duty-free shop at the airport...

I asked for Davidoff Cool Water Woman, as I wanted to connect those aquatic notes with the scent of the sea. Well, tough luck. The salesperson wasn't going to let me have that. With that question, I became “Davi-doof” to him.

“Are you crazy!! - Do you want to smell like millions of others! - Come on, Gucci has released a Glamorous line - you should try that and then we’ll talk....”

So I tried... Gardenia was great, but it turned too sweet on my skin.

With Flora Magnolia, I initially sensed a citrus scent, and I love citrus fragrances. Then I detected floral notes.

But I left the store without buying anything... Until...

Suddenly, a fine, extraterrestrial-galactic noble chocolate scent unfolded, paired with angelic peony and sandalwood, which I can't describe.

I was enveloped in the finest fragrance I had ever smelled.

Since vanilla turns too sweet on my skin, this was the perfect counterpart that developed well on my skin.

Unfortunately, the sillage isn't as strong as I would wish. However, I find the longevity of 5 hours to be really good.

What can I say, this fragrance flirt cost me quite a bit. With a budget of 20 euros, I ended up spending 80 euros on a fragrance, but I haven't regretted it to this day.

From this flirt, over the years, a great love for fragrance has developed. I'm soon buying my 5th bottle.

And I thank the salesperson for helping me find this love for fragrance and uniqueness. Because each of us is unique - we just have to dare to be so."
Flora by Gucci Glamorous Magnolia,05/05/2015,pudelbonzo,F,2405,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Glow and Glory,"First of all - I also love wearing Flora - especially because of its enchanting lightness and romantic floral notes.

Could Glamorous Magnolia keep up with that?
Definitely!

This fragrance shines in glow and glory with bright freesias, green notes, and a tangy fresh citrus peel - right from the start.
Then, the pale pink magnolia blooms in a truly glamorous way, adding a gentle sweetness to the fresh-green entrance.

Another highlight is the fine chocolate, which skillfully merges with the sweetness of the magnolia.

A special fragrance blend that certainly has a glamour factor, yet still presents itself romantically.

My friend gifted me this beautiful fragrance today, which is also fitting for the season - and we admire the elegant magnolias in the garden together."

After a long search, it had to be the very best... Then the discovery: Like a precious treasure, I carried it home. It became a very close confidante, yes, a beloved: the Glamorous Magnolia.

She is a lovely and delicate one, who absolutely lifts the mood with her pleasant character. Her first breath is fresh, a little green, and slightly citrusy. Her indescribable beauty truly shines when she reveals her heart: wonderfully dense magnolia and peony blossoms that radiate in all their glory. A warm, slightly powdery sweetness beautifully rounds off her presence, her completion, allowing her to emanate enjoyment and joy for her admirers for many hours.

My unique friend is neither intrusive, nor kitschy, nor overly sweet. How else can I describe her? ...simply one of a kind and incomparable...
I just can't get enough of her: my Glamorous Magnolia."

It may sound strange to say this, but my untrained nose detected something very sour, almost rotten, at the end of every breath of this perfume. I’m so sorry for everyone who loves this fragrance. But I just can’t stand it. Now for the good news:
I gave Glamorous Magnolia a chance (especially because its color promised freshness). I love, love, love this scent. And I think I know why by now. Personally, I just don’t like floral fragrances that are simply sweet. However, here the magnolias are combined with wonderful citrus notes, which I personally really enjoy. Moreover, the sweetness of the magnolias is not a sharp sweetness, but rather a delicate, caressing sweetness. This results in a soft, green, fresh, yet warm fragrance that I find very pleasant."

Flora by Gucci Glamorous Magnolia,08/14/2014,NadsSpatz,F,596,,0,Magnificent Magnolias,"~ Inspiration ~
Last year I tested Gucci's ""Flora"" and also received a sample of ""Glamorous Magnolia.""

~ Bottle ~
The hexagonal shape corresponds to that of the original version, from which the new ""Garden Collection"" with fragrances like Magnolia, Tuberose, and Gardenia has developed.

~ Fragrance ~
It is not just made of Magnolia, but this forms the centerpiece of the scent.
With fresh citrus peels, green notes, and freesias, it starts fresh and slightly herbaceous. Blooming magnolias and peonies give it a sweet-floral and slightly powdery character. Musk, sandalwood, and dark chocolate round it off with a woody warmth.

~ Longevity ~
On my skin, it lasts about 6 hours (on clothing and hair a bit longer). 1-2 sprays are sufficient, as it is quite intense and synthetic.

~ Occasion ~
A nice everyday fragrance for spring, summer, and autumn. In winter, it is too floral for me.

~ Conclusion ~
It bears a slight resemblance to ""Oh Lola"" by Marc Jacobs."
Bloom Profumo di Fiori,04/21/2024,Zaneexplain,M,23,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Blossoms,"Man oh man, this is straight white spring blossoms bottled into a scent. Spring has sprung with such vigor these last few weeks where I am, that you can't go anywhere without powdery and soft florals dominating the air - and Gucci Bloom can give you the same sensation wherever you are.

It's mostly ylang-ylang and for the duration of the scent. A very linear but powerful fragrance. You can spray this on your clothes and I kid you not, will be there the next morning still just as powerful. I'd definitely say it's feminine, but I think a warm floral on a man is just as suitable too. I mean I've been wearing it for a year."
Bloom Profumo di Fiori,03/22/2025,Telekinec,F,498,,2,The power of white florals,"Gorgeous, heady and sophisticated white florals. Jasmine and tuberose are clearly the stars here. Exuberant white fragrance: carnal, powdery, and fresh with a beautiful creaminess. I do detect a hint of green, like smelling a freshly picked flower and inhaling all of the flower's parts: petals, heart, stem and leaves. Ylang-ylang also offers its presence, giving the scent a lovely creaminess, but also a hint of tropical sweetness that further complexifies the scent and adds a beautiful layer to it. Drydown is warm, creamy, musky and powdery.

It's a very complex scent that honors the white flowers in here. Not my thing since I'm not a fan of powderiness and I'm not that into white flowers, so it won't be making it into my collection, but I do recognize it's a very strong fragrance that has lasting power. For people who love powderiness and white florals, this might be a great choice!"
Bloom Profumo di Fiori,05/14/2025,Wario,M,21,,1,Bloom Profumo di Fiori,"The opening really goes strong with the white floral notes. Jasmine and the Rangoon Creeper found in the others. However, the ‘sun-drenched wood’ accord here does really bring a bright and sunny feeling to Profumo di Fiori.

Creeper starts off the strongest to me. Then, the jasmine really kicks into overdrive for a long while.

Solar notes have become more common in fragrances over the past few years. With the blend of floral notes, this perfume does have a warm and somewhat buttery quality to it. In the early stages, at least.

Ylang-ylang comes in to further this trend. A nice yellow floral touch to the jasmine dominant mix.

The sandalwood stands out as the non-floral part of this early. Well, aside from that generic wood note, that is sun-drenched. Later, this gets muskier, not to a huge extent. Just, more noticeable than the woods.

As it dries down, the tuberose and the jasmine sort of split duties as the leading notes. Ultimately, more of the tuberose. The ylang-ylang sticks around somewhat, but whatever is left of the Rangoon Creeper has gone into oblivion it seems.

In the end, this is a sunny and upbeat white floral with bits of ylang-ylang, musk, and wood."
Bloom Profumo di Fiori,12/16/2024,Ziemelumeita,F,7,,1,My favorite floral scent,"This is quite a strong white floral scent that some people will not appreciate. I love it because it's not as light and airy as other floral perfumes but stronger and headier, almost spicier. My sister told me I smell like a barn the first time I was wearing this. It's still very approachable, but better and more nuanced than the original Bloom. It's the ""ugly"", unglamourized side of the countryside."

But boy oh boy can you not tell. This beautiful floral really works well with human body chemistry. The sharp initial floral dries down into something aquatic and lush. As an avid SSRI enthusiast, this perfume has saved my life more than once when it came to my own personal underarm swamp situation. How can you tell I've sweat through my shirt when I smell like Gucci Bloom Profumo Di Fiori? That's right, you can't! I'm wet and unstoppable!"
The Eyes of the Tiger,05/22/2025,ClaireV,F,969,,1,Adorable baby powder,"An adorable powder puff of a thing that takes the cleanest, most golden resins and grinds them down into a fine talc that begs to be laid down thickly on a bosom. It smells babyish and coquettish in the best way possible. Last Sunday, I put this on in Fiumicino airport and it clung to the sleeves of my cashmere cardigan all the way back to Nairobi, cocooning me against far less pleasant smells in a blissfully white, pearlescent cloud. I smelled like a freshly cleaned and lotioned baby. Almost a week later, it still lingers on the fabric."
The Eyes of the Tiger,01/18/2021,Sniffsniff,F,23,,59,Under my Amberella,"I was annoyed. Really annoyed. You know that feeling, right? That latent annoyance. You read and read, for days on end. Pyramids. Up and down. Every Egyptologist would turn pale with envy. So many beautiful pyramids. And then you pick one. Eureka. The pyramid of your unfulfilled fragrance dreams. That one that contains everything you’ve ever dreamed of in a pyramid. You absolutely need it in your small, exquisite pyramid collection. And I mean SUBITO!
And then the postman arrives and drops a completely innocent padded envelope in your mailbox. Salivating and with flapping lips, you rush outside, immediately tear apart the carefully sealed packaging, and spray the first drops of the long-awaited dream pyramid onto your wrist in a trance-like state right in the hallway. Instinctively, you raise your hand and ... ZONK! Well. While your lips, succumbing to gravity and disappointment, seek their way downwards, you already wonder how a fragrance that is perceived extremely positively by so many people can be so painfully mediocre. And why did this damn pyramid lie so brazenly? And you know what? If it had only been this one time ...
But no. The more you test, the less you like it. You’ve probably become more discerning, no longer allowing just any old Ambrocashmeralonemaltolfusel to be slipped under your nose. And that’s where the misery begins.
Do you smell that too? That base? Yes, exactly! I mean that Baaah-sis of space musk that makes us all smell a bit like Hans-Jürgen's old sweatshirt after the fabric softener bath. I’ll just put on my hate cap right away. We’ve picked ourselves a nice hobby - you and I. And then this nonsense also costs real money! One is allowed to lose their temper over that. After all, not everyone is born with a high tolerance for frustration.
But I don’t want to just complain here; that’s not good for mental balance in the long run. And it causes wrinkles - except for me, of course. Because sometimes, things turn out quite differently. Then the corners of your mouth can actually point towards the ceiling. You’ve probably experienced that now and then too. It happened to me just recently when a small, inconspicuous spray bottle rolled out from one of those hastily torn envelope remnants.
Gucci was written on it. Well, that can go horribly wrong. They can create beautiful fragrances. Undoubtedly. But unfortunately, they often also shamelessly achieve the complete opposite. The Eyes of the Tiger. Mon Dieu. We’re fishing in quite lyrical-botanical waters here. If the name is too over-the-top, I’m always ready for confrontation. It’s like with children. If eight-year-old Quentin-Cassian fumbles while tying his shoes, I also find it hard to applaud.
But no, Gucci has a concept, of course. I just say: Amber. In faraway China, amber symbolizes the soul of the tiger. And what is considered a mirror of the soul? Yes indeed. You see, that’s how the circle closes, and we’ve clarified why this (I’m just going to shout it out into the world) stunningly beautiful, softly vanillic, and cuddly resinous amber scent is named as it is. And do you know what the best part is? Nothing annoys me here at all. And that means something. Normally, I jump out of my skin at the slightest thing that isn’t exactly where I want it to be. These tiger eyes are the purest sedative for my sanguine nature; they comfort, they envelop, they provide warmth and security. Not a tiny bit of synthetics, nothing! A perfectly rounded, deeply harmonious fragrance, whose extraordinarily natural quality justifies its (well, exorbitantly high) price. Or let’s put it this way: Compared to other outrageously overpriced fragrances, ""The Eyes of the Tiger"" smells significantly more high-quality.
When I set out this morning to comment on this fragrance, I spritzed myself with four hearty sprays from the little test atomizer and made my way to the stable. Drizzle, just above freezing. A gently resinous sweetness envelops me on the way across the fields. The weather is secondary. The fragrance warms me. Rain? So what? It protects me. And it does so without the specific amber heaviness that clings to so many heavily ambered perfumes, which I absolutely detest. Let’s be honest - that viscous amber feeling that often carries a hint of animalic ... it’s no good. Yuck! That annoys me right back. It feels like some clever clogs has gelled the air when you breathe. But no need to worry. The tiger eyes are free from gelatin and puma cages. The scent progression is overall quite linear and unremarkable. Here too, the fragrance remains true to its calm, grounded aura. The feather-light resinousness of the top note gradually transitions into the most beautiful vanilla base I know. I perceive a very slight powderiness, which never becomes dusty or cloying, but merely prevents the fragrance from drifting into the sticky-heavy side of vanilla. I find the sweetness perfectly balanced and never piercing or shrill.
Oh, and if you’re expecting a punch with a club-like sillage because you absolutely want the entire northern hemisphere to partake in your good taste in perfume, I’m afraid I have to disappoint you. You’ll have to go to Louis - he has something for that.
You see, I really like it. It’s balm for my annoyed soul. A fragrance for arriving, for being with oneself, not a scent for escaping, but a destination scent. A therapeutic fragrance. Perfectly suited for treating acute pyramid traumas. Did you notice? It doesn’t have any."
The Eyes of the Tiger,01/04/2020,Jambo,M,14,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Heart of the Tiger,"I have been quietly reading along for ages, and usually, there is a collection of comments for each fragrance that describe what I think in a more refined way or at least provide enough information to make my own comment unnecessary. There are rarely fragrances that I truly chase after and need to experience for myself to form an opinion - this is one of those. Why? I’m not quite sure. Maybe it was the name that reminded me of the universally beloved movie hero :)

Basically, the ""title"" describes almost everything. Almost everything? Well, not quite. Fans of the film series will have seen all parts including Rocky 6 aka ""Rocky Balboa,"" for all those who haven’t (Rocky is one of the most underrated film series for me and is far from getting the depth of its character recognized in the mainstream) - Rocky 1-5 is practically the life story of a nobody who fights his way up from the streets of Philadelphia, loses fights, wins fights, gains wealth, loses wealth, turns friends into enemies and enemies into friends, but fundamentally always fights with himself - an outwardly rude, stubborn, whiny, eruptive, and cynical person, but inside an empathetic, sensitive, and sad soul in a constant battle with himself. In the sixth part, the series culminates, and Rocky has reached the end of his career, his dearly beloved wife has died, his wealth has faded, his relationship with his son is strained, and his other social interactions are marked by (self)-pity. He indulges in memories of past days and sinks into a permanently melancholic state of mind because the measures of his self-worth, first professional success and then familial success, have crumbled, and he sees a broken man in the mirror who has no goal in sight and has lost his zest for life. He imparts a lesson on life attitude to his son, which has since become part of the standard repertoire of every YouTube motivational video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk82j1jQw_8), but which probably applies just as much to him as it does to his son. Nevertheless, a never-ending, small fire burns in his heart, and the motivation that brought him to this point still sparkles in his eyes - this indomitable will to show everyone and not give up, despite the adverse circumstances, which also leads to a reconciliatory ending of the series and gives Rocky the chance to finally make peace with himself and his soul.

So much for the digression - now to the perfume. How does all of this fit together? For me, the title ""Eye of the Tiger"" actually doesn’t fit the perfume at all, nor does the music. The symbiosis of an animalistic, untamed tiger to a cuddly little tiger happens for me more in the heart, and that is exactly where the perfume belongs. The spicy-smoky start with amber gives way after a while to the powdery, balsamic vanilla with a hint of rose. I can relate to the ""dustiness,"" but it doesn’t bother me at all. There is nothing to criticize about the sillage and longevity, absolutely high quality. For me, it’s a fragrance for a cold, sunny autumn day when the wind blows a bit harsher than usual and you see the slowly browning leaves reflected in the puddles. Summer is now over, autumn has long taken hold of us, and the longing for warmer days alleviates the nostalgia of the colder and darker days a bit. If there were a Rocky score that accompanies this perfume a bit better in my opinion, it would be this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdcAwpXK1a4

Conclusion: The perfume is far more complex than I expected, and if I had to describe how Rocky's heart smells - this perfume would describe it perfectly. At first, it’s a bold, almost intrusive companion that becomes gentler over time and offers a sense of security without suffocating. In any case, I am smitten, and if it weren’t so expensive, I would have taken it home right away. Unfortunately, it remains only on my list of perfumes from which I will acquire a decant when the opportunity arises and use it on special occasions."

So, who recognized the intro??
Honestly, is it because I'm a child of the '80s or do you also hear the resonant name ""The Eyes of the Tiger"" and immediately think of the first few notes of Survivor's ""The Eye of the Tiger"" from the movie of the same name (the third part of the Rocky series with Sylvester Stallone and Mr. T.)?
Ridiculous, because it creates a complete misassociation!
Gucci's ""Tiger Eyes"" have nothing to do with the struggle for survival on the streets, the challenge of wanting to assert oneself against an opponent, or the thrill of a fight. It's not an exciting perfume in that sense, but rather a pure cuddly scent!
Here, Alberto Morillas once again shows that he really excels at creating scents with a cuddly factor and skillfully showcases the balance of amber and vanilla. Have you smelled it all before? Not quite..., at least not with Gucci. Because in my opinion, this fragrance does stand out a bit from the brand's usual style. These ""Tiger Eyes"" don't pierce you with their gaze, but rather brush against you softly and tenderly. The cistus and the hint of an unlisted touch of musk (my nose agrees with that of Yatagan) give it a special sparkle, reflecting a trace of subtle eroticism and perhaps just a tiny bit of hunting instinct. More like a tigress with particularly flirtatious eyes who might be a little in heat?
The scent is certainly persistently cuddly and enchants with its sweet-ambery smoky soft aura.
If Rocky had worn this for his fight with Mr. T., the two surely wouldn't have gotten out of the clinch, and if they did, it would probably have ended in an invitation to a candlelight dinner..."

now it’s summer and I just couldn’t resist trying it from my cabinet. I remembered the scent as sweet, floral, and very long-lasting... nothing very extraordinary, but also not unpleasant.

Now, sprayed on in summer, it reminds me of a certain sunscreen or was it the oil from Hawaiian Tropic? I definitely feel like I’m in vacation mode now... for a hot summer evening at the beach bar, it’s certainly not the worst choice...

Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Femme,03/20/2025,UnicornCoco,F,374,,1,The Scent is Fun,"even though I won't be adding it to my collection, as it is a bit too close to ""Hubba Bubba"".
It starts off very sweet, which I like, right away with a spicy unusual note. I guess it's osmanthus. Fortunately, there are no citrus notes. Then it gets even sweeter (wisteria) and just a tiny bit fruity. That's the moment when the scent starts to remind me very strongly of the pink chewing gum.
After 40 minutes, ""Hubba Bubba"" is gone and tonka bean is very present, a bit of fruitiness remains and vanilla brings the next, warm soft sweetness.
It is a joy to sniff, but I wouldn't want to smell like this myself."
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Femme,12/24/2023,Christacita,F,60,,7,"Of Guilt, Forgiveness, and Marzipan","Dramatic sounds fade into the biting night, filled with piercing cold. Sounds, emerging from a dark brown violin, whose heaviness recently tells of a sorrowful sadness. First timid, quiet notes that suddenly pick up speed, as if their only goal is to escape the frosty sub-zero temperatures. Vivaldi's Winter. An all-encompassing sadness, whose beginning is based on a tragic guilt and thus continuously takes its course. Overwhelming, like the weight of a gigantic stone on innocent blooming daisies. All-consuming. No light shines nearby, only individual flames burn in the blazing beyond, far removed from any real existence. The hellish tunnel continues to expand, dark and invincible.

What would she give for a spark of hope in her utterly discouraged being! What would she give for a few meager gestures of love and forgiveness in this suffocating emptiness of loneliness! What would she give for a bright spark of light in this all-consuming, darkness-occupied world!

Time takes its course and changes fundamentally as if by magic. There it is. The patch of earth, illuminated by individual bright rays, far away yet so close. Velvety expanses, violet tones that produce joyful sounds. Vivaldi's Spring, those gentle tones of the Allegro that can even awaken bears from their hibernation. The burden disappears as quickly as it once crept in. From here to now. The elixir of life is here and waits to be tasted, to become healing and whole. The elixir that symbolizes forgiveness.

To the fragrance. Even if individual opinions differ vastly from mine, I still stand by my own. This scent embodies the elixir of life par excellence. It is joyful, graceful, dense. Once, guilt (Guilty) may have been at work, to rediscover itself anew - not entirely harmoniously. With this fragrance, those times of guilt are over and are replaced by the elixir of life and proverbial forgiveness. Once sprayed on the wrist, it enchanted me immediately. The top notes consisting of citrus and flowers come across to me as creamy marzipan. I love it. The base lingers on me for quite a long time, releasing pleasantly warm essences that feel earthy, woody, and simultaneously gourmand. An absolute dream. Since ""Rush | Gucci,"" I have found my way back to the House of Gucci after 24 years.

The elixir of life has its price. Well, in a few weeks, I will turn 50. Perhaps I will treat myself to this expensive bottle for the occasion. Merry Christmas, dear ones.

""Forgiveness is the greatest task of love - and its greatest risk."""
Guilty Elixir de Parfum pour Femme,10/23/2023,Ergreifend,F,528,,17,The Downfall of the House of Gucci,"Clearly referencing the current Netflix series in the title.
But I don't even find the series exciting, let alone the fragrance.
I actually like the book much better (The Fall of the House of Usher
short story by Edgar Allan Poe) and, as so often, things are not presented as originally as they should be.

I honestly have no idea what Gucci has produced here, as it is as uninspired as so many newcomers from designer houses. Yes, I have been constantly complaining lately, except maybe about the new scent from D&G. That one was quite alright. But this here is an outrage. Especially for so much money. Some regular brands can do better and for significantly less money. It's a shame really, because Gucci had fragrances in the past that were enjoyable and that people liked to wear. Guilty was my guilty pleasure scent back then; I emptied several bottles. Even today I find it lovely, but I have become more discerning. I think you know what I mean.

This scent here smells like the many €10 Bipa fragrances - artificial, overly sweet, with flowers thrown in. A pronounced, piercing opening that carries so much violet, which is already overwhelming. Rose that spreads everywhere, but is as artificial as a rose from AliExpress. Creamy undertone, with an indefinable cosmetic note. Vanilla sugar dusted, sinking into warm, damp earth. There’s not much longevity; it oozes oily, spreads insignificantly on the skin, before it gets a truckload of artificial flowers dumped on top.

The scent itself has no progression, no depth. It just oozes along. It sneaks around like a newborn kitten that isn’t yet steady on its feet.
The longevity is pretty poor for an elixir, and the sillage is the same. I can’t find joy in the bottle either. It would certainly look good on the vanity of a 14-year-old. Sorry to the fans, but that was my first association with the bottle.

Well, what else can I write? Everything has actually been said. Once again, a flop for me. Inside, I would have been excited because it is a Guilty and evokes many memories, but this one is simply quite unsuccessful."
Eau de Gucci,08/08/2024,SwabGames,M,86,,1,Beautiful and unexpected,"As I brought the bottle to my nose, I smelled florality and a hint of vanilla. Hyacinth, ylang ylang and lemon open up at the beginning. An unusual feeling of freshness, like in a forest. Then the aroma began to smell floral, everything smells: jasmine, lilac, lily of the valley, iris and rose. Although there are a lot of flowers, it seems that you have come out of the forest into a clearing strewn with flowers. At the end it starts to smell like cedar, moss and vetiver. Although the aroma tries to show sweetness at the end, the aroma still smells like wood, a very beautiful tree."
Eau de Gucci,10/16/2025,MrsGuerlain,F,548,,1,Anaïs Anaïs with add ons,"I do not remember how I got my hands on the gorgeous fragrance, and it came without the top - but I do feel lucky. This is on level with Gucci Eau de Parfum, which I am very fond of. Actually, I have come to think that Eau de Gucci is a beautiful mix between Envy EdT and GEdP. The top is definitely Envy, fruity and fresh, almost sparkling and when the top fades, the Iris and the other flowers push on and softens the scent. I do sometimes make a comparison to Cacharel’s Anaïs Anaïs (the original from 1978). But EdG performs way better and has this very delicious citric aspect, that AA lacks.
EdG is long lasting and wraps me in a haze of uplifting notes for a whole day. I wear this when the temperature is below 10 degrees.
Do not hesitate to buy, if you get the chance.

Eau de Gucci,06/15/2014,Kugeldistel,F,101,,19,Bellissima,"Eau de Gucci was the second women’s fragrance launched by Gucci after Gucci No. 1 and exudes Italian-urban flair: A spritz and Villa Borghese, Trevi Fountain, Colosseum, Spanish Steps, Via Condotti, or Piazza Navona flash by. If I had to describe Eau de Gucci in one word, it would be “sophisticated.” Despite the “Eau” in the name, which suggests a light refreshing water, it is a demanding class fragrance full of life that radiates effortless elegance and stands on equal footing with Gucci's masterpiece Gucci No. 3.
By definition, Eau de Gucci is a pure Chypre with bergamot and lemon in the top notes, and oakmoss, vetiver, and musk in the base. However, this fragrance is nothing like a typical Chypre, as it is soft, cuddly, and full - the woodiness, often bitterness of a Chypre is completely absent here. The notes of Eau de Gucci are so complex and skillfully woven into a dense fragrance veil that I cannot filter out individual components. The overall impression is that of a white floral, slightly spicy scent with green undertones and a hint of sweetness, where the floral bouquet is rather abstract in nature, meaning it conveys the idea of a white floral fragrance rather than the scent of white flowers themselves.
In the 80s and 90s, Eau de Gucci was sold as a fresh summer fragrance (inexpensively) and the perfume books from that time also list it under floral-fresh fragrances. A look at the fragrance pyramid mentioned above shows how much the definition of “fresh” has changed over time. With heavyweights like ylang-ylang in the top notes, tuberose and lily in the heart notes, and amber, musk, and vanilla in the base, Eau de Gucci today would almost be considered a Floriental. Additionally, Eau de Gucci Concentree (in the blue packaging) also had a hint of an animalic note (civet?). Corresponding to its time of origin, Eau de Gucci also scores with long-lasting wear and quite a strong sillage."
Eau de Gucci,10/01/2017,Serafina,F,479,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,11,No rule without exception!,"I am not a fan of Chypre! Most of the perfumes I got to sniff as a child in the 70s seemed to belong to this fragrance family. Of course, I didn't know that back then. But some perfumes that I received as samples (I was curious about everything fragrant!) or that were used by my mother's friends gave me headaches.

Even today, I can rarely identify a single note in the typical perfumes of the 70s, aside from the distinctive oakmoss. Now I know that oakmoss is not necessarily my favorite note - too often it comes across as bitter, harsh, or even sour on me at first. However, some floral Chypres do belong to my repertoire; I find most of them to be elegant, slightly aloof scents that are well-suited for more serious or festive (mostly evening) occasions, such as theater, opera, concert, or even Christmas parties (no, not the extravagant kind!). But I still cannot quite warm up to herbal-green Chypres.

""Eau de Gucci"" is presumably a floral Chypre according to the pyramid, but in my perception, it has more of an autumnal-woody quality. Again, I cannot identify any individual notes. For years, I have been using a mini that I regularly bring out in September because I find it fitting for the early autumn mood. Now I have also acquired a vintage bottle. Why do I like this one and others Chypres less? Kugeldistel has already mentioned it - the bitter oakmoss is very subdued here. This makes the scent more pleasant, even though it remains distinctive and unmistakable.

And the vintage has a very decent sillage! I also really like that about this perfume."
Eau de Gucci,12/10/2012,Jennytammy,F,60,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Floral Chypre with a Strong Character,"At the outset, Eau de Gucci is very fresh and citrusy. The bergamot and lemon combine with a noticeable spiciness, probably from the balsamic galbanum, which snuggles beautifully between the citrus fruits. You can immediately tell that this is a very rich fragrance with a strong character.

As a tuberose lover, I must, however, search in vain for it here, just like for the lilac. Iris and rose push themselves to the forefront, while the lily of the valley tries to keep up, but it’s simply too small and fails to do so.

In the base, it doesn’t change too much. I can detect a hint of amber, but I don’t recognize any vanilla at all.

All in all, a very beautiful fragrance and a floral chypre as it should be."
Eau de Gucci,01/02/2010,Snowflake,F,112,,6,"Once again, a top fragrance that is being taken away from us.","A great all-rounder, I am really sad that it is no longer available!"
L'Arte di Gucci,11/02/2013,GothicHeart,M,133,,4,L'Arte di faccia tosta ...,"L'Arte, huh?... Well, what can I say? It matches its name perfectly. Art... The art of indifference and nerve! Because even negative aspects demand a certain artistry. And here, this snob Italian lands a blow! She takes no prisoners! Insolence and sass galore! Rose as a note in perfumery, is not something I am truly fond of. (When it comes to male fragrances especially, I find it almost impossible for rose to be harmoniously blended in the composition. Untill now, only Loris Azzaro's Acteur and Alain Delon's Iquitos have found a not just decent but stunning way to do the trick.) But here rose shines! And not in a usual and, more or less, expected romantic way. No! A dirty and marginally vulgar rose it is that drags you by the nose... It is the scent of a woman who, under her expensive suit ( a Gucci one doubtless), hides leather underwear and a stiletto. A stiletto that she shall not hesitate to use, if all else fails (most unlikely). She had the misfortune of being born in a fin de siecle. In an era when the loud and hyperbolic (nonetheless dazzling) enfants terribles of the '80s started walking the path to oblivion and the watery and optimistic voices of the '90s started to gather attention further still. But she didn't care about it. To tell the truth she NEVER cared about anything! And today, even after so many years have passed since her departure for the heaven of lost scents, she still remains a serious contestant for the title of the most ""Fuck you!"" and ""In your face!"" attitude of the last decades..."
L'Arte di Gucci,03/04/2013,BronxBeauty,F,58,,5,Pretty Nearly Perfect,"Like many writers on this blog, I own many, many chypres: dry green, herbal, fruity, rosy -- you name it, I've owned it. For me, perfume pretty much requires oakmoss. There are two green chypres I consider pretty nearly perfect, and both were made by Gucci: L'arte and Gucci 3. (I prefer the latter slightly.) Both are wonderfully juicy, lush and well-blended, not elegant and austere as some French chypres are. If you like the genre, you must try them."
L'Arte di Gucci,07/20/2014,ScentFan,F,336,,5,"Oh, My! Hello ...","I utterly concur in your conclusions, but disagree with your imagination, GothicHeart. A woman wearing this isn't hiding leather or a stiletto under her clothes. She's got nothing on at all under there. Onlookers -- or I should say ongawkers -- see this plainly under her expensive silk dress. Everyone's polite, of course. Her jewelry's real and she's wearing the 80's version of Jimmy Choos. The guy she's with is a rakish, rich, worldly scoundrel who wants other men to ogle his conquest. They're dining late at the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, having just come from the theater. When they get home, he's going in the back way so they can strip naked and get in the pool under the moonlight. Inside they'll drink champagne. She says she'll never forget this night.

Or so I imagine.

L'Arte di Gucci moans passion and elegance. It's a woman who makes lyric love all night and the next day writes poetry. True, if anything interferes she gets a stiletto. Minor detail, though.

Hubby hunted an unopened vintage original down for me, I fell so in love with this rosy Chypre/Oriental. It's in line to be in my oriental shiff-fest underway, but a whiff of it this morning demanded instant review. If I could only have one fragrance, this treasure is one of the few I could live with forever."
L'Arte di Gucci,01/17/2022,Lolalibertin,F,22,,2,Holy Gucci!,"This one is a true Art of perfumery for me! I really treasure my every bottle of this discontinued beauty. For me this is an epitome of one-of the kind perfume that is not made anymore! I wish i could have twice as more as i have of it now so it would last me a lifetime. Prepare to be noticed when you wear it, not everyone likes it and understands it nowdays (it IS a heavy scent and really bold), but you going to feel yourself like a million-dollar lady! Pure sophistication and class! But this is strictly a cold time fragrance for me, i would kill anyone near me wearing this one at summertime.
A LOT of roses and big jar of honey with some spices (coriander anyone?) and you will get an absolute ÜBERsexy, animalistic fragrance that is full of passion. It takes some nerve to wear it, but if you can handle it you won´t regret. EDP is a lasting monster, lasts for over 24h on my skin and even longer on clothes.
Use it with caution, do not over spray it or you might end up having a headache. 3-4 sprays are more than enough.
But in general this is a true masterpiece and one of my most favorite and outstanding fragrances! All later Gucci edition don´t even come close to this one! Truly THE BEST Gucci ever made for my personal taste. (Gucci nr 3 is amazing as well and is on the same level of quality)"
L'Arte di Gucci,06/11/2021,Leimbacher,M,2870,,21,Ape-mazing Aldehyde Masterpiece,"“L'Arte di Gucci” belongs to no decade, no color, and hardly to any company or DNA. It is simply a Grand Dame, for whom neither time, hype, nor money matters.

Aldehydes. Everywhere I smell aldehydes. Clear, bright, fine aldehydes. Underlaid with a blue-blooded, fruity-fluttering rose that also breaks boundaries. “The Art of Gucci” - if only the brand would reveal itself like this more often nowadays… Herbal, chypre, a bit green, a bit prickly. Beyond any doubt. A scent that massively blows me away. Definitely ready for the close-up. Rarely wearable in my mind - but that’s it for critiques. Otherwise, a queen in the Colosseum. A perfume for Anita Ekbergs in the Trevi Fountain. Incredibly noble and magnificent. Intimidating.

Bottle: a piece of jewelry!
Sillage: elbow elegance
Longevity: 8-12 hours - wide range.

Conclusion: feels more Chanel than Gucci. And that is a compliment of the highest order. This olfactory masterpiece is an extinct dino, of which every bone should be preserved, praised, cherished, and cared for. Timelessly beautiful. Died as an idol."

L'Arte di Gucci,10/29/2010,Fran,F,253,,0,Grandezza,"From the series ""holy grails"". This time: L'Arte di Gucci. When: early 90s to late 90s. How many bottles: only three pieces, but always the large bottles, and it was quite expensive back then, and one of them was even the Eau de Parfum, which was extremely intense and long-lasting. A long and deep love. When it was no longer available in German retail, I searched for it during every trip abroad. It is completely incomprehensible to me that L'Arte di Gucci disappeared relatively quickly back then. A shame.

After I had already discovered some favorites (Magie Noire, Coco), L'Arte di Gucci hit me like a bomb. I confess: I bought it after my best friend (with permission). She, in turn, received it as a gift from her then-boyfriend. He simply went into the rather professionally run small city perfumery, got advice, and hit the nail on the head. She loved the scent immediately and for many long years. And I couldn't resist either; I was immediately captivated by it. So, the scent, not my friend's boyfriend.

L'Arte di Gucci was a super elegant, radiant, loud yet finely composed Chypre blockbuster with stunning Italian Grandezza. The grand entrance, the crowd around you parts as if by itself, the enchanting aura surrounds and radiates. No old-fashioned aldehydes disturb, everything here is 90s-modern, chic, noble, luxurious. A rather dry scent, radiantly bright yet sensually dark, sour, but by no means flat, rather very deep, with a classic oakmoss base. Very full-bodied, yet very sharp-edged, pointed. The others are soft and cuddly; L'Arte had edges and corners, yet it was so self-assured and feminine that it was still very captivating.

Dress code: the little black dress, the grand gown, or - very sexy - the black fitted business suit with the bright white blouse with the pointed, open collar. Although I wore it more to lectures or parties back then; business was not yet on the agenda."
L'Arte di Gucci,12/16/2017,Serafina,F,479,HELPFUL REVIEW,13,How much is a work of art worth?,"Presumably as much as the wealthiest lover is willing to pay...

No, I will not pay the astronomical prices for which a normally-sized bottle of “L'Arte di Gucci” is offered online! Even for the miniatures, some proud sums are demanded. No, I will instead content myself for now with my two miniatures, which, despite their considerable age, are still intact.

Although I am known not to be a fan of chypres, I do make exceptions for certain floral chypres and grant them my sympathy. “L'Arte” is an opulent blend of floral notes, where the aldehydes and oakmoss prevent the scent from appearing sweet or playful. Instead, they give the fragrance a slightly austere elegance, which I particularly appreciate at festive evening events during the pre-Christmas season or even on Christmas Eve itself. And I detect a dark base here that would do honor to many current perfumes that boast of containing oud. No, oud is certainly not in here - but this dark base truly makes “L'Arte” a small work of art for me.

I find the bottle extremely fitting for the fragrance!

Perhaps one day a bargain for the normally-sized bottle will come along...

Addendum (02/18): I have since managed to snag a large bottle!"
L'Arte di Gucci,08/28/2012,Florblanca,F,1168,HELPFUL REVIEW,11,Here it really packs a punch!,"A few weeks ago, I was asked to take a look at Gucci No. 1. I did just that and quickly found what I was looking for. However, during this search, I also stumbled upon other Gucci fragrances that are no longer available today. My enthusiasm for Gucci No. 1, along with Fran's wonderful comment and my curiosity, led me to seize an irresistible offer from L'Arte di Gucci.

I must admit that this scent is not for me. There are very, very few Chypres that I like, as they must meet very specific requirements for me. L'Arte di Gucci does not meet those, although I have to concede that it is a truly wonderful Chypre, and every Chypre lover and Chypre enthusiast should know it.

The opening is sharp, angular, almost piercing, and it overwhelms me a bit.

But the heart note reconciles; dry, fine, bright, absolutely unsweetened, yet in full bloom, it envelops me in a rather impressive scent cloud. In other words: the sillage is quite remarkable. I feel as if the fragrance is moving in this stage. It gets louder, then quieter, softer, and then sharper again - nothing is calm and relaxed. L'Arte di Gucci is the fragrance for a very self-confident, strong woman, because wherever she appears with this scent - she inevitably stands in the spotlight.

Towards the base, it becomes really dry and dark green. I suspect moss, but something resinous also comes through, as even the base is not calm and relaxed, but continues to follow the tenor of the entire fragrance.

L'Arte di Gucci is one of the most beautiful and pleasant Chypres I have tested, and even though it is not for me, any Chypre fan should fall in love with it. I can only agree with Fran when she says it is a shame when such fragrances are discontinued!"
Bloom Intense,03/04/2023,Sjefke,M,32,,1,In Love,"I really like perfumes with white flowers. Jasmine and tuberose are my favorite. Still, the Bloom line never once convinced me to buy one. It lacked conviction. I therefore had few expectations of the new Bloom 'Intense'. Mainly because of the patchouli and spices added to the notes.
But I couldn't have been more wrong.
The white flowers, especially tuberose and jasmine, open the fragrance in a soft and sweet way. They smell so realistic. I think the sweetness comes from the coconut. Soon the patchouli joins the fragrance. Where I normally hate patchouli it is now beautiful. It makes the tuberose woodier and that in combination with the coconut is great. Somewhere the ginger buzzes around the flowers. The smell doesn't change anymore. It gets softer and softer, after which it slowly goes out like a candle.
Kudos to Gucci for this flanker. Gucci Bloom 2.0
A golden move to add coconut and make the patchouli more dominant."
Bloom Intense,10/22/2024,Maddyfor,F,16,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,An old new acquaintance,"I stumbled upon Bloom Intense by chance in the perfume shop... The shelves at Gucci are currently very colorful and filled with flowers due to the new flankers... in contrast, the black bottle - which looks almost minimalist in this line - caught my eye.

When sprayed, it starts with a beautiful and soft orange blossom - nice, but nothing special, I thought. Then I somehow forgot about it while shopping.

At home, then hmmm... what is this?! And why does it seem familiar? It must be something older... Vintage vibes? A very, very noble floral scent wafted into my nose. Warm woods joined in... it felt so familiar. It seems so much more interesting than the bottle suggests, lush and opulent... but not overwhelming.

A few days later, I was struck by a bolt of realization... I know where the association comes from. It is owed to the Queen of the Night, which we already know from the old version of Dior Addict (2012) EAU DE PARFUM. It is not a 1 to 1 copy, nor an alternative... but the similarity is definitely there. This is where the vintage touch became clear to me.

A very, very noble and beautiful scent that still feels modern. It was still easily recognizable on the jacket from the day before. This bottle had to be mine... I really can't help it..."
Bloom Intense,09/15/2023,FlirtyFlower,F,81,,35,Only Vintage is More Beautiful!,"How about vintage vibes?
How about expensive cream?
Really floral, like a dream from Provence?

Actually, there should be a comment here about the regular Bloom, which embodies true beauty through the rangy, the neroli, and the tuberose, but unfortunately also represents intense stuffiness.

However, when I test the Intense, I have to admit that I am holding a genuine candidate for purchase in my hands.

The beauty lies in the high quality of the natural ingredients. There is no synthetic scent detectable.

And the floral aspect is so beautiful that I almost sink into it like a cloud.

It is lush without being suffocating.
It is refined without ever appearing banal for even a second.
It is interesting, even without the keyboard of individually perceivable components.

Okay, the sillage isn't super strong, but enough to have a pick-me-up for cold gray days by your side every day!

Vintage-creamy!
Vintage-floral!
Vintage-beautiful!

Absolute recommendation for testing!"
Gucci pour Homme,06/01/2023,ChicoRoch1,M,163,,2,The first Gucci,"This classic indeed is distinctively from a different/much better time. This fragrance doesn't shout, doesn't pout, and doesn't even last that long. What it DOES do is wanna pull you in for a closer whiff. When that happens you can easily smell all of those classic Masculine notes not seen or smelled so much nowadays. Notes like Carnation, Cedar, Oakmoss, and leather just to name a select few. I love Everything about this Classic Chypre, from the ingredients to the distinctive bottle. I was 5 yrs old when it was launched in 1976 and if I was of age back then this beauty EASILY would've been my go to scent of the night. I say that because, to me, this was/is a definite nightlife fragrance. Man things are so different now it's almost depressing. I mean, do people even go out and dance anymore?? This, along with Halston Z-14 was likely all over Studio 54 and other haunts as well. I love the earthy leathery and quite subtle scent this exudes without chopping your head off. The only drawback is the price as it's severely expensive so you have to dig deep to acquire this gem. I received a great deal though on this one and I'm looking forward to buying another from this long gone masculine era. So this is in my top 10 and it'll stay that way for a long time to come."
Gucci pour Homme,06/19/2024,Krmarich,M,225,,1,The greatest dancer!!!,"I arrived a little late to this party, yet after watching House of Gucci, I had to find a bottle of the original inspiration for men. This lost masterwork speaks a different language in today's market for men. In fact, it is totally foreign to anything sold or bottled after 1990.

The composition is fairly classic for its time. It seems so subtle with its streamline notes. Citrus, vetiver, carnation on leather and cedar sound dull in today's market. It doesn't shout or project very far. It seductively draws others in to get a better wiff. Its anything but dull. In fact, it's exciting as an inch of fresh cut bills in your wallet. Most modern ""blue trends"" are no comparison for today's crowd. This was when tattoos were vulgar.

The 1970s was ""so free to do what or who you wanted"" and this was what men who had carloads for money would wear for a night on the town. This smells like wealth, prestige and status. If you had the cash, then you had a pair of those gold lined shoes to go with it. Otherwise, you might be a ""wanna-be"" in the crowd. I imagine those wealthy men at Studio 54 who would mingle with the ""commoners"". If you were single, people might swarm you. Remember the disco classic He's the Greatest Dancer? "" The best designers, heaven knows-Halston, Gucci, Fiorucci..."" I get it now!"
Gucci pour Homme,11/17/2014,Drseid,M,828,,0,The Attack Of The Composition Killer Anise...,"Gucci pour Homme (original formula) goes on with a short lived blast of natural lemon with powerful oakmoss from the base immediately detectable underneath coupling with aromatic lavender and carnation. As the composition moves to its early heart the lemon vacates as the oakmoss gains strength, now joining a potent anise and musk-laced leathery labdanum with the carnation remaining in support. During the late dry-down the anise driven development abruptly transitions to powdery vanilla and amber over slightly sweet sandalwood as traces of the supporting musk remain through the finish. Projection is average to slightly above average and longevity very good at 10-12 hours on skin.

This composition is a real puzzler. When one reads the amazing list of notes it is hard not to sniff Gucci pour Homme without a positive disposition to love it; after all, the composition has a lot to recommend it... The natural lemon at the open is amazing though all too brief (most likely made even more brief and minimized by the age of the vintage bottle I acquired). The co-starring green oakmoss and leathery labdanum (rock rose) smell great together, leading to a quite remarkable abrupt transition to the powdery vanilla and sandalwood driven late dry-down. That said, while I do *like* the composition the love has surprisingly eluded me. I suspect the culprit that is holding me back from completely embracing it is what can best be described as a musky anise heart accord that just overpowers everything in its path at times and feels a hair out of place in this chypre. I would almost expect this kind of accord in a classic fougere, truth be told. So while the composition smells impressive on the whole, the anise plays spoiler, relegating it to ""good"" but not ""great"" status... The bottom line is the $100 per 30 ml bottle on the aftermarket discontinued original Gucci pour Homme smells very nice on the whole and features some high quality materials but the musky anise heart accord holds the composition back from its full potential, reducing it to a ""good"" to ""very good"" 3 to 3.5 stars out of 5 and a recommendation with minor reservation."
Gucci pour Homme,11/02/2014,Cappellusman,M,358,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Vintage Treasures - Vol. VI,"Another gem from my legendary visit to the ""Ferrari"" perfumery in Bolzano in September.

Yes, Gucci could still do it back then. With this, its first men's fragrance, Gucci set the bar so high that they could only surpass it once (""Nobile"") or reach it again (""Envy"").

I wore ""Gucci pour Homme (1976)"" back in the 80s, when I was olfactorily interested, but by no means as passionate about perfume as I am now. A very good fragrance. The kinship noted by Zaphod with ""Trussardi Uomo"" does not reveal itself to me; the Trussardi is far too dark, gloomy, and ill-tempered, while this fragrance here appears quite friendly in contrast. The look at the fragrance pyramid does not mislead; just as classic as it is structured, the scent unfolds. Wonderful transitions between the fresh-citrusy opening and the spicy heart/base notes. For me, it's a classic suit fragrance, not heavy enough for the opera, but clear and unobtrusive, perhaps for a business lunch.

I have the vintage OF as an EdC in the splash bottle, as was common back then. Therefore, one must naturally make compromises regarding longevity and sillage. I believe that the EdT in the 80s had real punch, but I can't say for sure anymore.

The colleague is very hard to come by. A mini or two is still available, but OFs can almost be called phantoms, as rarely as they have crossed my path so far. Well, I own nearly 100 ml, and that should last me a while..."
Gucci pour Homme,09/21/2012,Zenkido,M,21,,3,Very familiar...,"I eagerly unboxed it today because I have been looking forward to this scent for a long time. Letting it sit directly on the back of my hand... sniff... sniff... delicious... classic... herbal... but somehow so familiar....

I pondered with my eyes closed about which scent Gucci pour homme reminds me of... mossy green... patchouli is detectable... pepper... citrus... then sprayed Horizon by Guy Laroche on the other arm and lo and behold: to my nose, hardly any difference. It may be that better-trained noses can discern the nuances, but I cannot. Gucci is perhaps a tad ""softer,"" ""soapier.""

For those who only care about the scent and not the collector's value, they should really consider the much cheaper Horizon in comparison. I would be interested to know if other noses smell it the same way I do.

Unfortunately, I can't contribute more as a first comment on this classic because I've already said everything else in the review of ""Horizon."" :-)"
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense,10/24/2025,minilover92,F,20,,1,love it!,"sweet and soft to begin with. yes, it has „intense“ in its name but it’s not too overpowering. perfect for a warm spring or fall night. it smells like a fruity cocktail. i find myself smelling it from time to time cause it’s just so lovely. people will definitely give you compliments and the scent lingers for hours! if you love sweet, dreamy scents, this will be for you."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense,09/06/2025,Ladymarie,F,50,,1,A sweeter fruity version of gorgeous gardenia,"I really like it. It somewhat resembles a sweet, fruity candy while still retaining the floral creaminess of the gardenia. It’s a more intense bolder , sweeter version of its gorgeous gardenia predecessor. It lasted all day and even could smell traces the next morning though I would not say it was noticeable to others at that point."
Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Intense,08/20/2025,Xavica,F,311,,1,Where's the Gorgeous Gardenia?,"It smells exactly like the original, though I have to admit this new version delivers far better longevity and projection (though, given how weak the original was, that’s hardly surprising…).

As for the scent itself, to me it’s mostly brown sugar and red fruits. Not unpleasant, but far from remarkable – too sweet, too ordinary, and the gardenia? Completely missing, as far as I can tell.

What I do love, however, is the bottle. Its vintage silhouette, paired with a vibrant, modern color, gives it a delightfully playful edge."
Guilty Love Edition pour Homme,05/08/2020,Leimbacher,M,2870,,19,Love Is Everywhere,"Gradually, the ""Guilty Pour Homme"" line from Gucci has indeed turned into a somewhat successful series, which (certainly not just) I personally did not believe after the first few flopped releases. ""Love"" is the new, green version, roughly a summer flanker. What can this limited edition, which spreads itself nicely on the shelf, offer?

Let's put it this way: it is a nice, refreshing scent. But it is not the next hit for the line. ""Guilty Love Pour Homme"" is a bubbly, sparkling vetiver sunny boy somewhere between generic and very pleasant, invigorating, sexy. A good hint of chemistry (swimming pool, sunscreen, mowed artificial grass) resonates, but at the latest, the bright, erotically clean vetiver backbone more than compensates for that. Fruity, citrusy, tingling from the belly button to the little toe. A decent, short-lived summer companion. It doesn't hurt anyone, and no one will miss it when it is gone and forgotten in a few years. Especially not those who have bolder, character-stronger colognes in their collections.

Bottle: great green, nicely frosty
Sillage: discreet and not overpowering
Longevity: this green fellow never exceeds a meager 4 hours

Conclusion: Pause for thought. A bubbly, tingling summer pleasure between mowing the lawn and the chlorine pool. There are prettier scents. There are worse scents."
Bloom Parfum,05/29/2025,Ursaw,F,166,,2,Flowers growing between the railway tracks,"The start, while it is too sweet for me personally, is very yummy. Jammy apricots on fresh spiced bread. Gentle musky vanilla below. Mellow white florals. It's lovely. The apricot note in particular is adorable, I can almost feel the slight fuzz of its skin when I sniff it.

Moderate sillage – maybe an arm's length, but barely. Once you're in the cloud though – it's quite potent, if not overwhelming.

I've tried two different Blooms, this one and Bloom EAU DE PARFUM, and both of them handle their white flowers in an identical manner. Heavy, but very creamy and clean. Honeyed. On the verge of being gourmand. Delicious. A smell of a warm summer evening.

Unfortunately, both of these perfumes share another similarity – an unpleasant drydown. I suppose it's balsam's fault in this particular case?

About ~2 hours in apricots and most of the flowers wither away. What's left becomes bitter, and not in a fun way. Reminds me of the unlucky flowers that grow between the train tracks and sometimes get drenched in black tar and machine oil. Unfortunate.

In another hour it all fades away. Leaves a faint bitter aftertaste. Fuzzy vanilla. Not the nice kind of fuzz like there was at the start, more like touching a fluffy synthetic sweater. But to me Gucci's drydowns often smell like that. Ah well."
Bloom Parfum,03/13/2025,Ziemelumeita,F,7,,3,Perfect summer evening scent,"When I first saw the bottle and list of notes I knew this fragrance was made for me and I wasn't wrong. It is complex and unique - one of those rare moments when designer just gets it right. Jasmine and tuberose is a beautiful combination present in all Blooms, but in this flanker it really lets the other notes shine. The cardamom and black balsam give it a smooth and velvety sweetness that doesn't overwhelm you, making it a perfect evening fragrance for summer. I can't wait to have this in my collection."
Bloom Parfum,05/09/2025,nyedufte,F,43,,2,milky chai latte,"GORGEOUS chai latte, cardamom, milk, cinnamon, dry wood. might be my favorite release this year. a tinyyyyyyy hint of something fruity in the dry down. passion fruit? i think it might be the tuberose that I'm interpreting weirdly. it only makes it better though. great for warm-spice fragrance lovers!!"
Bloom Parfum,09/28/2025,Xavica,F,311,,1,An Unfortunate Association for a Spicy Jasmine,"I tested Bloom Parfum by Gucci, and at first, it unfolded as a delicate jasmine - soft, floral, and unmistakably elegant. But quite quickly, it took on a spicier character. The cardamom here immediately reminded me of the seasonings in… the French boudin blanc (!) I could have sworn there was nutmeg in there too. This unexpected association made me see the fragrance through a very personal, slightly whimsical lens.

Unfortunately, because of this rather unfortunate connection, I didn’t enjoy the perfume. I simply cannot imagine walking around leaving a sillage of… boudin blanc!"
Bloom Parfum,09/24/2025,AwhShucks,F,15,,1,Nice Light Floral,"I like this Parfum a lot, it was an impulse buy because I thought it smelt nice and the bottle was elegant. I chose the small option because it was a bit expensive for me at the moment and didn't want to regret it, but to my surprise it wears really well! It has a slight musk tone but keeps the sweetness throughout the wear time. I am a big fan of Jasmine and White Floral so Bloom is right up my alley. It lasts about 6-8 hours depending on the activity. I would recommend this parfum!"

Bloom Parfum,03/16/2025,Triplesixxer,M,4,,7,Incredible Flower to Spray,"I am a bloom fan, many are not. I definitely sense that. But I can't imagine how anyone could not like this one.

The regular one smells like the premises of the local flower shop, this one has those notes too, but it comes across warmer. The cardamom makes it mildly spicy, it radiates beautifully.

Upon the first spray, it seemed almost light, but after 30 seconds, the depth of this wonderful fragrance unfolded. The vanilla and musk smell completely natural, for me, it’s one of the most beautiful women's fragrances, even though I usually prefer lighter scents.

I would buy it for my wife anytime again, I would wear it myself too. Simply amazing.

The only downside: the bottle is really beautiful. But why on earth is the label crooked? Well. It doesn’t detract from the fragrance at all.

I love everything about it."
Bloom Parfum,10/04/2025,ProudBo,F,7,,0,Subtle bottle that reveals its presence when you unscrew it,"It is the apricot that brings a magic of sweetness and depth at the beginning, almost something dark. Standing under the Christmas tree, aware of itself while everyone else is still focused elsewhere. Ready to enchant and soothe you with Christmas magic and weight. Funny, although such tropical fruits... it really reminds me of Christmas scents."
The Virgin Violet,10/14/2023,MoniBonboni,F,175,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,If only the violet weren't so short-lived,"First of all, how beautiful is this packaging? The box alone is very high-quality, has the look of textured leather, then the pouch, and then the beautiful bottle. Inspired by the first perfume vessels that once stood on wooden shelves in pharmacies, the fragrance is available in an elegant, white lacquered glass bottle with a porcelain-like appearance, adorned with golden accents.
The swan as a symbol of the purity and grace of the scent.
Released in 2019, the nose behind it is Alberto Morillas.
The first haute perfumery line from Gucci, ""The Alchemist's Garden."" The collection, consisting of Eau de Parfum, fragrance oils, and Acque Profumate (""fragrance waters""), was inspired by the art of alchemy and perfume creation. Each fragrance is based on a special component that represents one of the house's distinctive codes and can be enhanced, muted, or blended into a completely new, unique scent with other fragrances from the collection.
Violet combines with musk and iris flowers to create a soft, powdery scent. Timeless and calming.
For me, it is definitely a winter fragrance.
A beautiful violet scent, delicate and nostalgic; unfortunately, the longevity is very short.
Elegance and comfort. Well-behaved and properly made. Not a scent for a hot night. Also not a fragrance to wear while out and about, but perfect for moments when you want to appear mature, relaxed, and elegant.
Sillage is good, and unfortunately, longevity is not. But when has violet ever been long-lasting?"
The Virgin Violet,06/11/2019,Hägar13,F,7,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,4,Recipe: Crushed Violet,"Since I have been working in a ""Kneipp"" kindergarten for some time, I occasionally try out some recipes with plants and herbs at home.
I love the scent of violets, and since a few grow in my garden, I wanted to make violet sugar.
So I set out to pick violet flowers, and since there weren't enough (I wanted to leave some standing), my son had to go look for more (he found some at the cemetery).
The violets went into a mortar.
You probably know the movie ""Perfume,"" that's how I felt while squeezing the essence out of the lovely, delicate little flowers.
What remained was a mushy mixture that gets mixed with sugar.
Now everything is poured onto a piece of paper to let it dry well.
When I smelled the violet sugar after an hour,
I was shocked - it was no longer my beloved violet scent! I had to retreat from the concentrated essence; it was piercing, yes, biting.
And that's exactly how Virgin Violet smells.
Okay, the base becomes more subdued and powdery/creamy, bearable.
In this case, Gucci has done a good job; the scent itself is very authentic and natural,
but for me, it's just not it.
However, my son found the smell very tasty and occasionally sprinkles the violet sugar over his food."
The Virgin Violet,02/23/2019,DarkWinterCS,M,291,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,A comet full of powder and violets meets the skin,"Now, how does one describe a scent that is better explained visually than with pure words? Just imagine a mouse strolling over the mirror shelf of a makeup vanity, stumbling upon something beautiful and falling into a large pot of powder. On the way to its destination, it takes a detour through the cupboard with baking ingredients, leaving its prints in the vanilla sugar.

To find a comparison with other fragrances, I would say it lies somewhere between Tom Ford's Fucking Fabulous and - what I consider - the unisex Valentino Uomo Intense. It is slightly less sweet and creamy than Fucking Fabulous and a bit less spicy-leathery than Uomo Intense. The quality of the fragrance is clearly evident in that it never veers unpleasantly in any direction. Instead, it always remains pleasant on the skin, feels luxurious, and showcases its lasting and unobtrusive sillage at the best moments.

One can forgive the fragrance for not developing further after the top notes. The heart and base notes remain consistently high quality, characterized by a delicate powderiness and a hint of vanilla and musk.

I must now treat the start and the consistently constant note in this fragrance separately. Here we have the intense and radiant strength of violets or violet flowers. This note is present with such intensity that one might think they are bathing in a sea of violets. However, it is never over the top, allowing me, as an opponent of floral scents, to actually love this fragrance. At the beginning, I had to ponder whether I could find pleasure in it, but ultimately the scent won me over.
The mentioned longevity and sillage are exceedingly present, but never in a way that is bothersome. I once sprayed the fragrance on my forearm and could smell it through the ends of my sleeve throughout the day. Here, we easily have 10 hours on the clock.

In conclusion, it should be said that fans of TF Fucking Fabulous and Valentino Uomo Intense should take a look at this one, as the quality and performance are spot on. The design of the bottle is, of course, worth mentioning."

Neither trying nor provocative.
They are friendly companions that delight the nose.
And so does Intense - just with an elegant attitude.
With this scent, you can go to a concert or theater, as the fragrance exudes elegance - without disturbing the surroundings.
Moreover, it is not a chypre, and thankfully, it lacks that scratchy note.
The violet lightly dusts the fragrance, and plum and vanilla provide softness.
The lychee is gently sweet, accompanied by enchanting ylang.
But all the ingredients are well-balanced, so Intense does not stand out awkwardly.
A successful fragrance - that has nothing to be ashamed of."
Guilty pour Femme,02/12/2022,WickedGame,F,11,HELPFUL REVIEW,4,"Goodbye my Love... Luckily, I got backups.","The old Guilty Intense cannot hold a candle to this misguided improvement. ...I have had a deep emotional connection to the mentioned perfume for 8 years.

A few weeks ago, now available in our stores, I soon found a sample of this new variant in my Douglas bag.

The following happened after the initial spray:

No glamour, no elevated elegance, no underlying eroticism under the guise of feminine fragility...
Instead, a sweet arrow of fruity/floral origin pierced the air.
It dragged a fat banner behind it that read
""Oh yes, look at me everyone! Notice me! Here I am! Now comes GRANDMA!!!!""

At first, I thought the floral note was gardenia, but then I was laughed at by the tuberose, flanked by lychee and plum...
Later, tuberose along with the fruits mutated into floral chewing gum...
The fruitiness here overshadows the floral aspect. This makes it feel very playful on one hand, but also too much on the other. The once lovely lilac is nowhere to be found. All in all, I perceive it as a cheap, uneven dupe.
The whole thing is well thought out and designed to imitate the old version in a cheap way...

The best part of the perfume is the dry down... which seems to consist SOLELY of patchouli... overshadowed by fruity-fermented remnants.
From start to finish, I had the impression of having aged years with each spray... As if Gucci (the brand) tried to appeal to that generation of perfume users who aged alongside the old Guilty Intense over the years,
I also had to think of my grandma and that I should maybe call her again. She used to wear a similar perfume.
Longevity and sillage are merely the same. However, this version feels too cheap for me to ever spray it again.

The old version is only available at astronomical prices now.

I apologize in advance to everyone who celebrates and loves the new scent."

The perfume impresses me with its floral-rosy scent.
The smell fades after a few hours, which I don't find problematic since I generally don't spray much. Three sprays are good to be noticed - one to two sprays to smell nice.
Personally, I find the scent not too overpowering. Other people notice it, but they don't feel ""overwhelmed.""
I believe that the scent can be worn in everyday life. However, due to its elegance, I will personally use the perfume for special occasions."

Flora by Gucci Glorious Mandarin,01/19/2015,Leimbacher,M,2870,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Vitamins in Pills,"A tangerine, full of juice. Delicious, natural, almost at Guerlain level. Tasty, fruity, slightly sweet, yet not boring and even at the end not generic, but interesting & high-quality... all of this is NOT Glorious Mandarin from Gucci's Flora series!

The scent doesn't start off too badly, but then fades unusually quickly, until it completely loses its strength after just a few hours. The fragrance is quite sweet, with very little tangerine for the name. I can imagine that the body lotion works better, as the sweetness combined with creaminess would probably create a better symbiosis with the wearer's skin than the boring perfume. Musk, jasmine, and a bit of tangerine - finito! That's too little for me, but at least you can't spread any mistakes other than boredom. I would have loved it if they had really incorporated a stronger (or any) Pina Colada accord. Maybe then it could have become something like a creamy-feminine version of the great 2014 Summer CK Ones. As it stands, there are dozens of more skillful tangerine fragrances on the market - foremost among them Mandarin Basilic and Mandarine Ambree."
Flora by Gucci Glorious Mandarin,06/04/2013,Rattlebell,F,6,,1,I expected something different...,"...however, it turned out to be a positive ending for both of us :)

I was really looking forward to Glorious Mandarin, but since I already had Mandarin Basil from Guerlain, I expected something fresher and more mandarin-like.
The first time I tested it was therefore very sobering; I was disappointed.
It was too sweet for me, simply not mandarin enough (if that word exists), and it left a somewhat sad impression.

A few days later, I received the body lotion as a luxury sample thrown into my shopping bag. I tried it that same evening and was completely thrilled by the wonderful scent on my body!

It's a lovely fruitiness, slightly sweet, still not enough mandarin, but the scent smells great on me!
I don't find it too artificial now; the fragrance is pleasant, has something elegant about it, and I especially enjoy wearing it in the evenings.
Since I often get asked what I'm wearing, it has become one of my favorites!

I think many expected something different, which is why it may not always receive good reviews. I no longer want to miss it in my collection! :)"
Flora by Gucci Glorious Mandarin,01/23/2013,Rebekka98,F,8,,4,Plastic Mandarin,"I have this fragrance in a small sample here. How good that I was able to try it, otherwise I might have fallen victim to a blind buy frenzy given the delicious pyramid. Praise be to you, Souk. Since I became a member here, I have sniffed a lot, and I have rarely been truly disappointed. Perfumes are often not my thing, too sweet, too green, too who-knows-what. But still, I can appreciate the quality of the creations, even if I would never buy them. Glorious Mandarin disappoints me because - yes, why? All I can smell is sweet-synthetic-artificial-cheap-lemon-mandarin.
I don't want to offend the four of you who own this fragrance, but I would be interested in the opinions of the owners.
I feel no development; it remains static with its plastic mandarin scent. Do you know the plastic lemons that you can buy with synthetic lemon juice in the supermarket? Just imagine that in mandarin. The longevity is quite good, though. I often wonder why I can sniff out the perfumes I don't like so persistently, while my favorites often evaporate much too quickly. Maybe it's because the ""stinkers"" just annoy me so much, while the ""good ones"" belong to me so much that I no longer perceive them as foreign scents?
Do you feel the same way? If you're interested in this sample, I'd be happy to send it to you. Maybe the fragrance will then receive a more positive review."
Bamboo,06/07/2025,CurlyHen,F,42,,2,My accidental love,"Gucci Bamboo is called my ‘accidental love’ in my collection. It was a leaving present gift from a colleague 8 years ago. She made me open and spray it in front of her and was hit with a very sharp and detergent like opening that my nose disliked and I had to hide it with a smile and a ‘mmm lovely!’. It sat unloved in a drawer for 4 years and then my colleague joined my new team and the guilt kicked in. I thought I’ll wear it on her first day and maybe use it up at work until it’s done so I don’t have guilt. And surprised myself that when the bottle was done I just had to get myself another bottle. Most of my perfumes are unlike the others. So this one is a keeper for me, it’s lovely on my skin. There’s the obvious fresh, citrus opening from the bergamot, mandarin and orange blossom with a slight juicy floral round sweetness of pear, lily and jasmine. A powdery, very slightly spicy, musky dry down with the sandalwood and a very slightly spicy tease of ambergris with a layer of comfort from the vanilla in the base. I love this on my skin, I get delight from an almost sweet, milky, creaminess that must come from the ylang ylang that gives this lovely, subtle hint of honey every now and then when I move. I see this perfume described as a simple, uninteresting scent, and I know I’ve obviously developed a strong emotional memory to it, but to me it’s a classy, fresh with hidden complex gems that I just love and will always enjoy wearing this."

Can be used very generously and every day. Fresh, lightly fruity, but not salad-like, with a very slight earthy base note that still doesn't overwhelm, but allows the freshness to linger.
A great spring-summer scent for ""messing around."" Maybe a tad too expensive for what you get. But the bottle is well-designed. I like it angular!"
Gucci by Gucci,11/16/2010,Woelfin,F,243,HELPFUL REVIEW,9,Much better!,"The EdP is in my closet. I bought it - as always - blind; I like doing that. And I find it very herbal, although the base is really delicate and beautiful.

With the EdT, they loosened the knot a bit, which I really like. The typical Gucci by Gucci note remains, but this version is nowhere near as herbal as the EdP. It doesn't feel any less mature, but it is much more pleasant and feminine, right from the first sniff. The previously mentioned ""fruity"" aspect also comes through much better. (BUT one should not expect a delicious fruity scent).

One thing is for sure, I've never smelled anything similar to Gucci by Gucci before. You just have to experience it."
Gucci by Gucci,09/08/2009,DonVanVliet,M,287,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,I like it!,"Just like the perfume variant, I also like this version of Gucci by Gucci. A quite delicious, fruity scent. I like it!"
Flora by Gucci Generous Violet,08/09/2025,Kerkyra74,F,669,,1,I'm somehow out of it,"I'm sorry for everyone who likes the scent...but to me, it smells bitter in the opening, rancid as if Insolence EAU DE PARFUM had been spilled and someone mixed in violets and ink. Leather ???? Yes, the kind that got wet and wasn't treated and is now crumbling away. Sometimes you have fragrances that start off horrifically and then develop beautifully. I often experience that, but this one was already in other hands due to my impatience. Well, it doesn't get any better here...I also perceive a Maggi note and Indonesian patchouli. To be honest, even a plastic note. The last time I smelled that was when I rushed past a 24/7 shop on vacation that offered china at unreasonably low prices."
Flora by Gucci Generous Violet,02/11/2016,Möwchen,F,60,,12,Moments of Happiness!,"Sometimes there are happy coincidences in life, like today. I was actually looking for a nice spring fragrance. I should have been called by Engelsrufer, but unfortunately or fortunately, I didn't hear them. And since I never get anything for Valentine's Day, I wanted to treat myself. So off to the perfume store!

I don't know how many scents I sniffed. The new one from Escada, the new Poison Girl, the new one from Lancome, the new Velvet from Dior, the new Daisy from Marc Jacobs, the new one from Chloe in Love, etc., basically everything that's currently trending. But what can I say... it bores me, it bores me. One is almost like the last, so actually all just new softened or modernized versions of old classics or non-classics, depending on how you look at it.

Now this fragrance from Gucci's floral line isn't really new either, but for my nose, it was an experience today. Just by chance, in a small discount shelf on my way out, I saw the 100 ml bottle, which was half off. I had already sniffed too many fragrances, just one more and then I would leave. And this one knocked me off my feet, convinced me immediately, and I took it with me.

The longevity of this EDT is incredibly good! It's actually a classic. There are many fragrances with violet, but many can also come off a bit old-fashioned or smell, as I always say, a bit like hairspray. This one is for me the most beautiful violet scent that has ever come under my nose. It's fine-powdery, velvety like a cat, and at the same time as dangerous as a big cat. And the subtle wild leather note makes it irresistibly sexy! Forget the little violet being demure and pure, nooo... this fragrance is not that. So it's not just for the romantic ladies among us.

I find this fragrance more beautiful by the minute, and I feel so lovely with it, like the most beautiful rose in town. These are moments of happiness for me!"
Flora by Gucci Generous Violet,10/10/2015,UweUndBernd,F,45,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Gucci Première intense,"Inspired by the beautiful comment, I set out on a quest. And it was not without its challenges - testing it seems impossible. No perfume store had it. I should have taken the note in the ""Did you know?"" section seriously: ""This fragrance is only available in Gucci boutiques.""

I know the Gucci store, they have bouncers and I always feel like a criminal because I really can't afford to dress there. Besides, Hermès, Chanel, Longchamp, etc. are right next door, and I always end up wandering around for ages, leaving my account empty because I always find something I like.
But I love the smell of leather, and violets make my heart skip a beat. So I searched the internet and ordered a small bottle online. I was almost bursting with excitement. I thought of my brown suede jacket, the matching fringe bag, and the scent of violets in spring. So I unpacked the bottle right away and sprayed it generously. I start sniffing - But what was that? No sweet violets, no rugged leather. I am met with a floral-powdery blend that feels very familiar. It smells like Gucci Première, albeit a bit more robust and intense and without the orange blossom, but still very similar. I am disappointed. However, it clings to my skin forever; in my shirt, which had hidden from the washing machine, I could still smell it very intensely three days later. And it survives a shower too."
Flora by Gucci Generous Violet,07/26/2014,Clarissa,F,67,,17,The Violet from the Big City,"Be like the violet in the woods, modest, virtuous, and pure,
not like the proud rose, that always wants to be admired!

Many of you surely remember this saying from the time when grandmas, aunts, and friends wrote pretty sayings in your poetry albums and adorned them with all sorts of cute pictures.
I managed to save my poetry album over several decades and still smile today at the many meaningful sayings and well-intentioned advice.

But what is it about a generous, lavish, magnanimous, selfless, open-hearted, and bountiful violet (so the translation at leo.org)?

First, I must go back to last weekend and the following days that I spent with my beloved in Berlin.
Clarissa, in a generous mood, wanted to invest again.....!
No, not in real estate or even in gold, a new fragrance was the object of desire, and I was in the right place in Berlin.
At first, it was a scent from the Chanel Exclusives that I wanted to invest in, then my heart briefly fluttered for a Micallef fragrance.

Held back by my beloved, who couldn't quite get excited about the selected fragrances, I gave in to reason and postponed my investment plans once more.

While strolling along Kurfürstendamm, I wandered through the perfume department of a Karstadt store and discovered the generous violet from the Gucci Garden Collection, which I had not found anywhere else until then.
So I sprayed it on my arms and hands, as I was already out for a while and had tested quite a few, and on a paper strip.
What I then smelled exceeded my expectations of this fragrance - what a creamy, powdery, beautiful violet caressed my nose......!
So I went outside with my scent strip to my beloved, who preferred to stay outside with his cigar, and held the strip under his nose.
His comment was: ""This is the best scent of all that you've tested so far!""

I was astonished by his enthusiasm, as comments like ""too soapy"" (very popular) or ""You don't need that!"" often come up.

So what does this violet have that it charmed two hearts at once....?

First of all, I didn't buy the fragrance right away, but put the scent strip in my bag, which I then took out again when I got home and placed on my desk.
Again, this lovely scent wafted towards me, which had remarkably held up well on the strip.

So I held it under my better half's nose once more, and again his comment was that this was the best scent we encountered in Berlin.
Now it was clear, I had to have it, and lo and behold, it was even on sale at an online shop I like to use.
Two days of anxious waiting followed, and now it is finally here, and I am indulging in violet scent!

At first, the fragrance is wonderfully powdery, but quickly the creaminess follows, which I attribute to the iris butter and which I find very well-groomed and clean.
The suede from the base note is fortunately only subtly perceptible, as I do not like prominent leather notes.
This is not a modest violet, no, it is a very cheerful little flower that happily reveals its joyful heart to anyone who bends down to it.
For me, it is an absolute feel-good fragrance, wearable in all situations, and my clear favorite of the Garden series, as well as one of the most beautiful violet scents I have tested so far!

And when I now go into my garden and see the beautiful bunch of violets that has bloomed there this year as if from nowhere, I imagine that it also emanates such a lovely scent.......!"
Gucci Première,01/06/2015,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,9,very familiar,"Since my mother consistently wore this fragrance for weeks - indeed months - it is very familiar and pleasant to me.
It suited her sporty-elegant appearance wonderfully, which also reflected her relaxed, generous nature.

She liked to be well-groomed and tidy - unlike me - but generously allowed me to be myself.

We lived together under one roof.

And the scent, although elegant and somewhat luxurious, is by no means strict or dogmatic.
It has a stylish laissez-faire quality that suited my mom well.

When I cuddled her dogs, who naturally slept in her bed, their fur exuded this fresh-noble scent of orange blossom and champagne - as if they had rested on silk pillows at the Four Seasons.

They deserved so much class!

The Bulgarian rose warms the heart, and the leather reminds one of sturdy hiking boots worn for dog walking.

The creaminess of the woods corresponds to the cuddle hours when she snuggled with her loved ones on the sofa.

Premiere is pleasant for both indoors and outdoors.
It allows for flexibility - even room for interpretation.
Not a rigid scent - but a compromise-ready one.

My mom always said, while putting on her rugged boots:
Thoughts and dogs - must be taken for a walk outside!

For me, a fragrance for remarkable personalities."
Gucci Première,09/10/2014,Igli,F,57,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Confused,"A light, creamy feel-good scent that had me pondering for two days.
Namely, what it reminded me of. Every two minutes, I had my nose on my wrist, smelling something very familiar.
Rose, floral, creamy woods, not at all patchouli.
The longevity is unfortunately not that great, but that’s okay, I’ll just spray it again, I never run out anyway!

So now the solution:
Suddenly it came to me, the scent reminds me a lot of Eau de Lacoste, which I wore last year on vacation. Now I also know why vacation memories came to mind while sniffing!"
Bloom,09/09/2023,Ringtale,F,133,,1,"Okay, but nothing to write home about...","Sampled this. Reading the notes, I would have expected something more neroli- or orangeblossom-ish, but the neroli and organgeblossom are modest in this fragrance, which is good I think (nothing really cloying). Smelling the sample before spraying, the tuberose made me think: 'Oh no, not another Amarige-like scent, please!', but on my skin it is much more gentle. Wearable in spring and summer I'd say. I'm picking up quite some sillage when moving around; longevity I can't judge yet, but I expect that to be decent. I don't mind it, but it doesn't thrill me either.
A bit 'mainstream' and - loving the more vintage smelling perfumes - too modern for my likes, I guess.
Migraine prone persons should be aware that this can be a bit headache inducing."
Bloom,09/21/2022,Kurai,M,388,,2,Decent white floral,"Where many white floral perfumes are big and dramatic in presentation, Bloom EDT stays decent and evokes a pretty but harmless picture of a flower field in springtime. Honey bees dancing amongst rays of sunshine in the fragrant air. A bohemian vibe rather than burlesque.

I can not fully compare with the original Bloom EAU DE PARFUM as I have only tried that one on a blotter, but it seems the scent profile is pretty similar. A bouquet of white florals with little to no other notes. I reckon the EDT is a lovely spring or summer scent with its mild intensity. Definitely worth a try."
Bloom,12/14/2022,pudelbonzo,F,2405,HELPFUL REVIEW,14,A White Poodle on a Flower Meadow,"Currently, one perfume commercial after another is airing on TV - of course, it's the pre-Christmas season, and they want to entice customers with the scents.
I enjoy watching the clips, as they are usually imaginative and creative.
Moreover, they spark my interest in the respective fragrances being advertised.
Gucci has captured me with the snow-white poodle on a colorful flower meadow.
Does the scent live up to what this beautiful image promises?
I say a definite yes, as the lush jasmine is radiant white and vibrant - accompanied by enchanting tuberose.
The mandarin keeps the scent aquatic and transparent, so it doesn't become too much of a good thing.
The neroli adds a pleasant coolness that emphasizes the brightness of Bloom.
Light woods frame the scent profile.
Now in winter, it paints white ice flowers on the windowpane - in spring, it will reflect the sun's rays.
I am not at all fooled by the advertising, as the scent conveys exactly what the clip promises."
Gucci Oud,06/27/2014,Sandolina,F,3,,3,just tested,"So, after about 15/20 minutes oud top note, comes good old Gucci by Gucci EDP. Maby not same, but very very similar to GbyG. I mean it is nice perfume, but unnecessary. In this moment, oud is trendy, and Gucci follow this trend. However, notwithstanding, must say, I am a potential buyer ."
Gucci Oud,12/22/2014,Rickbr,M,190,,0,,"Focusing on the profitable trend of oriental perfumes centered on the agarwood accord, Gucci launched this year what is a flanker to its Gucci by Gucci 2007 creation. I think they chose this one maybe due the unisex aura of the 2007 one, although the result is only related to the it by the bottle and the secondary notes of musk, patchouli and pear. What is central and most noticeable is the now classic combination of saffron, rose and agarwood, which few brands have fled when they launch their ouds interpretations. Throughout the composition gucci oud seems to favor on me a little bit more the saffron and oud accord seems to go in and out of focus at times during the composition. At the opening, it has something quickly Animalic and smoky, blending with the pear and raspberry aromas. It's not as easy to recognize these fruits, it seems as if they had been dipped in a vat of rose-saffron-oud accord to give a slightly fruity and sweet tonality. After the fruity notes evolve, rose and saffron share space in the heart, with the rose being a little bit sweet and without any bitter nuances and with the saffron giving it leathery, powdery and spicy aroma. Finally, Gucci Oud ends in a more woody oud without medicinal nuances, and i also get some discreet patchouly earth at this phase. At that time, it fantly brings a Tom Ford Noir Noir resemblance in the skin, as a milder version of this. Honestly, this does not add anything new to the interpretation of this type of fragrance, but is concerned about offering something that not only stay on the oud and that seems to have plenty of development and harmony on skin."
Gucci Oud,12/25/2014,loewenherz,M,916,,15,Is Oud the new boring?,"There is a time window - and this window is not that small, I think it’s at least two years - during which one can still somewhat unnoticed jump on a fragrance trend, there are still combinations and variations to interpret it differently, to add something new to it, or if necessary, to quote it ironically. There are paths that have not yet been trodden or at least not widely worn.

Oud and especially the combination of Oud with rose are as well-trodden as the A3 between Cologne and Frankfurt.

There is something unworthy about a house like Gucci (even though pleasant scents were never their core business - they were saddlers, and they should remain saddlers!) to bother the world now with an Oud fragrance. I found Davidoff's Leather Blend too transparent and sales-driven, and unworthy of an upright perfumer to release an Oud fragrance in 2014. Montale might be allowed to. No one else.

Oud, don’t get me wrong - Oud is wonderful! I am always fascinated by what an inconspicuous fungus can do with a piece of wood. And there are many Oud fragrances from the years before 2010 that are wonderful - one like the other! The scent character of Oud is unmatched: radiant and metallic-glossy, at the same time hot and cold. Hard as a dagger made of Damascus steel and at the same time soft and sweet like ambrosia. A piece of Oud, called 'Jinko', from the 8th century is part of the Japanese crown jewels!

Gucci Oud is not a poorly crafted fragrance, not even that. And yet it lacks a lot - pioneering spirit and passion above all, but also depth and character and - if you sniff closely - a bit of quality as well. That it still doesn’t smell bad hardly reconciles here, because 'doesn’t smell bad' can no longer suffice for a rose-Oud fragrance.

Conclusion: Releasing this fragrance in 2014 is like saying: 'Look: Prosecco with elderflower syrup - something completely new!'"
Gucci Oud,07/24/2014,FLUidENTITY,M,246,,12,a) not reinventing the wheel; b) rather disappointing,"These were my first two bullet points that came to mind regarding G O. I had mischievously looked forward to this fragrance and could finally get my hands on it at my home base Munich at Oberpollinger and press the spray button.

Okay, some knowledgeable, competent noses had already expressed skepticism, and I must say: Gucci Oud is not that great. In principle, it doesn’t start off too badly, with a nice, interesting, stable top note that promises a lot, appearing dignified and well-ordered with a bit of pep, but then it lets you down, leaving nothing to follow that the nose would expect. While the top note was still interestingly compact with a spicy-fruity opening that suggests a truly noble and high-priced fragrance, the heart note is lackluster and even worse than the base.

The top note still has Montale quality. Some customers might pack the fragrance away after spraying it, as they are so pleased with the wonderful opening, but the further development falls flat because there is none.

The heart note with the promised orange blossom and rose reminds me of Dark Saphir by Agonist. (Please don’t take the comparison too literally, I can already see the noses jumping up) DS is also a fruity, floral Oud interpretation, but O here does not come close to DS at all. Here, the pyramid collapses like a house of cards, leaving only the cards scattered on the bottle floor, uh, on the table. The fruity-rosy-oud quality is understandable, but by no means satisfying.

The base is even less. And still for just under 140 euros. In the base, there’s a bit of wood with a little something else. A little something else that reminds of the spicy component from before, but is even thinner. So wood + to ensure it’s not just completely boring wood. However, by this point, the longevity has already become really weak. The sillage is not strong throughout. Only at the beginning is it quite okay. But for a rather high-priced Oud representative, it’s somehow not usable.

I hope I have been able to show with my lackluster writing style (stopped at 24 minutes during my first comment from my phone) that G O did not deliver what I had hoped for. I will not buy it, and my 60% applies to the top note. Unisex."
Gucci Oud,09/26/2015,Minzess,F,11,,10,A New Love...,"I'll say it right away... I have nothing from Gucci. Well, almost nothing. Now I have Gucci OUD. And I love it! A friendly saleswoman at Alsterhaus introduced me to it. At first, she wanted to pair me with some terrible scent from ESCADA (bahhhhh). I immediately told her not to come any closer with that stuff; I’m already allergic to the bottle. She asked me what I like, and I described... - she had just the right thing for me. Just the right thing? I don't know. She handed me the scented card sprayed with Gucci Oud. I felt dizzy! It smelled strong, initially way too strong and heavy. Then I caught fire. The rose and patchouli are clearly dominant... but what I like best is that the scent develops very dark yet warm on me. The woods are coated with saltwater. It smells like driftwood heated by the sun. Desirable. A little rose lingers and makes it a bit softer and rounder for me.

In short, after about 5 times at Alsterhaus for the ""Can I quickly test my favorite scent again"" meeting, I wavered from infatuation to love and bought it. It is expensive, but love, as we know, has no price."
Vanilla Firenze,11/01/2025,Omnipotato,M,388,,2,Smoky woody vanilla,"Not sure what went wrong with the ratings here (6.9 at the time of writing this review), but this is a decent smoky woody vanilla scent on par with Sultan in my opinion. On Fragrantica it’s a 4/5 which seems more reasonable, and I think the Parfumo rating will catch up. In the air it’s mostly just sweet vanilla, but on skin some smoky depth can be felt. Not quite enough to be a myrrh accord, but there is some resinous material apparent as well. Pretty linear, though some reviews are stating they can perceive a cardamom note in the opening which I didn’t. Sillage is quite soft but it lasts a while."
Vanilla Firenze,10/23/2025,paperdade,M,32,,2,Nuance on top of major mature smokey calm that Vanilla Firenze.,"Amazing Black Pepper and heavy Cardamom in the abundant opening, bitter, woody, starts off smokey. Recognize the The Alchemist's Garden in this, very mature, important, builds a nostalgic sweet segment, slight bonbon Cola like, think Enigma Roja. Classic, way way modern and novel. Balanced resins kept in check at elegance level, clearly all high quality ingredients. Get the Vanillas blend more in the mid on, dry, definitaly an acquired taste, personally can't get enough of it, amongts the complete black label part of the collection, get mature nostalgic with the perfect neatness to it. Very much pleased with the nonsafe blind buy, accurate Fragrantica pyramid but recommend checking out Gucci for detailed"
Vanilla Firenze,05/07/2025,M1KE,M,4,,0,Amazing and completely new to me,"As usual from the black line of the Gucci Alchemist Garden Collection, a proud bottle price of 345 euros. However, I must say that this fragrance is completely new and entirely unique to me. The scent was released in January 2025 and has been almost continuously sold out since then. The vanilla is strong and not artificial. Alongside it, there is a wonderful smoky note that makes the fragrance accessible to both men and women. I would describe it as neither feminine nor masculine. A perfect blend in my eyes."
Vanilla Firenze,04/02/2025,Dennis1104,M,995,,0,I believe there was more potential here,"Vanilla Firenze is essentially a solid fragrance.
However, I think it could have been even better.
There was more potential here.
The basic idea of combining a rather harsh and dry, yet somehow sweet vanilla with a pleasant smoky myrrh character is indeed good. Unfortunately, it somehow feels a bit uneven to me in parts.

The fragrance starts with this rather dry, but still slightly sweet vanilla. This slight smokiness is already hinted at in the background. There is also this very subtle floral character. I had actually guessed it was some kind of iris. But then I saw the notes and it was the iris.

After not too long, the myrrh accord becomes a bit more intense. I also feel like I can smell a bit of saffron. I think I can also recognize gentle woods in the background. The vanilla is still there, but now noticeably less sweet and just a notch drier.
It continues like this for my nose until the end.

The fragrance is super unisex wearable and has, in my opinion, quite appealing performance. The longevity on my skin is about eight hours, and I am very satisfied with that. It should be noted, however, that the sillage is somewhat milder. At first, the fragrance projects quite well, but then it noticeably becomes closer to the skin piece by piece."
A Chant for the Nymph,06/10/2023,Ostara,F,61,,2,Easy to Wear Tropical Floral,"A Chant for the Nymph is very pretty. To my nose however this is more tiare and ylang ylang than it is plumeria. It hovers around the wearer in soft, pleasant, sunny cloud. The prevailing character is smooth, billowy, and floral. There is a light nuance of makeup powder and pollen. ACFTN is all warm fluffy tropical florals throughout the wear time with not much of a discernable base beyond a smidge of vanilla and lactonic musk. All this smells really good, but not particularly distinctive or structured and that's okay.

This strikes me as the perfect scent for a bride to wear for a warm weather wedding, particularly a destination wedding in a tropical locale. If you're looking for something easy to wear that is joyful and optimistic, that radiates sunshine even, A Chant for the Nymph is a great choice."
A Chant for the Nymph,03/01/2023,Aleitao,F,6,,2,Dance while pursuing sunlight,"A beautiful creature dances gracefully in a clearing to a chant only she can hear.

This is beautiful floral on a bed of creamy musky vanilla.

You can smell that is made with high quality ingridients.

It's warm, not to sweet. Sunny, happy and warm

For sure it's signature scent worthy.
Unfortunately a little bit heavy on the wallet"
A Chant for the Nymph,12/13/2024,Schar002,F,58,,2,"A fragrance, a journey!","The strength of this fragrance is, for some, its weakness: Its absolute suitability for wearing in the South Seas, more specifically on the islands of Hawaii. There, it is as deeply rooted as the frangipani flowers in Hawaii. It fits there so perfectly, it’s unbelievable. It fits there even better than the local fragrance oils. Next to ""Oud Jaune Intense (Parfum) | Fragrance Du Bois,"" this was by far the fragrance for which I received compliments in Hawaii - especially from locals.
This fragrance managed to knock Oud Jaune Intense PARFUM off my wish list and moved into my collection during my -actual perfume break- while I was on vacation in Hawaii!
I found visiting a Gucci store in Hawaii somehow inappropriate; should my bottle run out, that will probably be unavoidable;-) (maybe then in Hawaii?!? ;-) )

It is really incredibly well made!
A truly wonderful frangipani scent, with plenty of sweetness and flowers. The fragrance is full and heavy, but: In Hawaii, I could dose it much more generously due to the climate than at home.
There, it doesn’t really fit into everyday life and is now used when I want to remind myself of Hawaii at home. And it will certainly also be used in the summer.
I wore it a lot on our outings, meaning outdoors. I can therefore imagine that it would be too much in office spaces, cars without fresh air, and indoor restaurant areas.
I don’t see it there either.

Of course, the question arises for what occasion it was created... perhaps the memory of the South Seas contributed to this?;-)

I personally am incredibly glad to have tested the fragrance as a sample. At home, during the first test, I immediately decided, ""This sample is coming on the trip."" And there it worked... I inevitably and in the best way associate it with Hawaii. And, as luck would have it, I found a bottle in the souk, which I discovered on Kauai, the morning before a helicopter flight. What a stroke of luck!
Back home, I enjoy the wonderfully beautiful bottle in the even more beautiful packaging. I like such things, even if you certainly don’t need them. And the fragrance... a dream!

Oud Jaune Intense PARFUM also received many compliments; I was firmly convinced that this fragrance would join my collection after the vacation. Ultimately, it seemed - to me - somehow too ""intentional,"" too pleasing, not ""specific"" enough to fit exclusively and immediately in Hawaii. (The sample came back almost completely full, used less than 5 times in 5 weeks.)

And that’s exactly what I wanted: A perfume that says 100% Hawaii, as I experienced it. No mental detours to the Maldives, to South Sea resorts... No!
For me: Hawaii. And nowhere else!

This may make it ""less attractive"" for many, but for me, it’s the main prize!
And that this dreamy fragrance is also in the most beautiful bottle ever... Life is beautiful! Aloha"
A Chant for the Nymph,06/19/2021,4ajbukoshka,N/A,83,,12,A chant for the Maikäfer,"It is summer. The air smells of flowers and blossoms, and at temperatures over 30 degrees, 4ajbukoshka meets her friends in a floor-length yet summery backless dress.
Freedom is within reach; you can not only hear and see it around you but also feel it and - in the form of ice cream - almost taste it.
The girls are carefree in a kind of hipster beer garden, ringing in the weekend with lemonade and boisterous laughter. It could be like this every day!
4ajbukoshka has now been wearing her new perfume for the second day in a row. Has anyone noticed? Njain.
The girls accept it without comment, while the similarly perceived green malachite has repeatedly caused (and will likely continue to cause) Jozha (affectionately called “Igelin”) to hold her sweet little nose in the air and ask what smells so sweetly of coconut, and then she literally sticks to 4ajbukoshka.
However, the May beetles seem to have a preference for nymphs, because although three young ladies are sitting at the table, they only fly into 4ajbukoshka’s hair (and get tangled there), on her back, into her dress, and everywhere else.
Does it look ridiculous how 4ajbukoshka, after jumping up from the table in a panic, hops through the beer garden whimpering, hoping to shake off her new fans? Very likely. She doesn’t know what’s chasing her until a waitress can calm her down, and she was afraid of being stung.

Conclusion: Was it worth it? No.
“A Chant for the Nymph” is really beautiful, no question.
It is un-sticky-sweet, floral-elegant, and quiet, with a barely noticeable projection (unless you hold your nose really close to the spray point, then you might feel overwhelmed, and it almost smells of white flowers).
In my hair, it amusingly smells woodier and a bit more bitter.
There’s nothing to complain about regarding longevity; it’s in the upper range (>= 7h).
However, it occasionally reminds me of “Vert Malachite” and... loses this battle decisively, as it lacks projection, a bit more development (or even more vanilla) would be interesting, and... it is not inspiring. Neither to sing nor to write a witty review. At most, to perform an anti-May beetle chase dance.
If it weren’t for the price, this would be a scent for the office, for weekdays, for non-special occasions like shopping, taking a Sunday stroll. Or something like that."
Guilty Love Edition pour Femme,04/29/2025,scentedindxb,F,11,,3,Beautiful Scent,"I loved it from the first sniff, and I bought it immediately. What a beautiful scent! I'm more into niche fragrances, but this one caught my attention! I wish the longevity was better but I don't mind respraying this all day. I'm planning to get another bottle cause I know I'll finish this quick. It's one of those perfumes that you reach for without thinking about it because it's so easy on the nose. I love the lilac in this."
Guilty Love Edition pour Femme,11/08/2020,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,13,Danger in Uniform,"I host some Guilty perfumes and always have to chuckle at the ""dangerous"" naming - because these scents are all ""innocent"" and friendly.
Just the way I like it.

The marketing department seems intent on ""demonizing"" them, which is completely unnecessary.

This endeavor reminds me of the charming bull terrier of our neighbor, who responded to the dangerous name ""Danger.""
The poor animal was cursed with the name, as ""Danger"" was the embodiment of kindness.
However, the appearance of a bull terrier with its strong crocodile-like jaws is not appealing to everyone.
And then there's such a combative name.
My friends certainly made a fearful detour around the dear creature - exclaiming: Danger in Uniform! Danger in a suit!
Despite this witty wordplay, the good dog deserved more pets.

And so Guilty Love Edition is a fine pink cloud that one wants to snuggle into.
Just as I like to cuddle into my pink silk pillows.

Love - yes - but more like infatuation or a little crush that lifts the mood - but remains casual.

Yet Love Edition is not arbitrary - just pleasantly friendly and light-footed.

The sweet fruits harmonize with the flowers - with the narcissus being soft and not piercing.
The violet adds a delicate bitter note, which remains transparent - thanks to the aquatic notes.
Jasmine provides bright elegance framed by equally bright patchouli.

Another beautifully rounded Guilty - and my verdict is: Not guilty!"

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraîche,10/14/2024,Missk,F,1357,,1,Green Bergamot and an Ocean Breeze,"Aquatics aren't usually my style, however I must admit that Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche is by far my favourite from the Flora range.

I wasn't a huge fan of the original Flora. Something in it just didn't sit right with me. I also found it unoriginal and plain. This Summer inspired flanker is much nicer. It's crisp, delicate and fresh. It also feels very feminine and clean on the skin.

Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche opens with green, citrusy bergamot and a refreshing ocean breeze accord. There are a fair few fruit notes in this composition, and while they are definitely present, they smell subdued on the skin. Osmanthus and peony predominantly feature in the heart of this fragrance, adding a fresh floral touch.

Due to the watery aspect, Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche seems like the perfect fragrance to wear to the beach or to the public pool. It is a very Summer appropriate scent. I doubt that I would crave such a fragrance during Winter.

Since its release in 2011, Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche has had quite a few good reviews and many fans. I can now see why it is so widely liked. I too wouldn't mind a bottle of this in my collection for the warmer months.

The projection may be fairly light on, however the longevity was impressive. Flora by Gucci Eau Fraiche lasts even longer on fabric. I highly recommend this flanker.

Original review written: February 2013."
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraîche,08/08/2025,Leimbacher,M,2870,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,6,Little Flowers and Fruits Fished from the Pond,"Wow, how many Floras are there from Gucci?! Anyway. I think I've clicked on the right one here, the one I'm wearing today... ""Flora Eau Fraiche"" - a... floral freshie?!

Forgive me, this scent doesn't exactly inspire me creatively. An uninspired Gucci concoction. Never bad, but despite the promising kumquat on paper, nothing stands out here. Soapy floral notes. Delicate fruit flesh. Subtle greenery. Pond and meadow. Cocktail and alcohol-free. Boredom and fluffiness. Politically correct. A lost rose for most of the time. No spark comes through, it feels fake... Don't get me wrong - it's never bad. But for me, it's also never good.

Bottle: square and sweet
Sillage: weak or tender?
Longevity: 3-4 hours, if at all

Conclusion: a watery-creamy Gucci bouquet without horror or applause."
Flora by Gucci Eau Fraîche,06/21/2011,Chanelle,F,752,,5,The Fresh Little Kumquats!,"I'm surprised that no one has shared their opinion on this yet - I've known the scent for 2 months now and so far, Gucci's fragrances have always flown off the shelves on launch day, what about this one?

I really like the top note; you are practically bombarded with bittersweet fruity kumquats. Unfortunately, they are just passing through, these wobbly little things. Once they're gone, the scent becomes floral-citrusy and still retains a bit of bittersweetness, resembling the heart note of Cafe Vert by Il Profumo. Great for summer. The base is spicy-fresh and woody, with patchouli taking a back seat.

Not bad!!"
Winter's Spring,01/14/2019,Skia,F,11,,19,It smells fluffy!,"Gucci jumps on the designer-exclusive-fragrance train, and they have really put in the effort!

The concept isn't really new. There are a number of perfumes, a handful of perfume oils, and three scented waters. This is supposed to allow you to combine your very own scent. The corresponding bottles differ in size, but also in design. And I find the design, reminiscent of antique apothecary bottles with changing animal motifs, somewhat kitschy, but still very charming; I can't help it!

I admit, the appearance has contributed significantly to my interest :D But certainly independent of that, I liked the scent from the whole range the best. ""Tears of Iris"" takes a solid second place.

But what does a squirrel have to do with mimosa?
According to the saleswoman, the scent is supposed to reflect the softness of a squirrel's tail. (Sounds a bit far-fetched at first).
On the Gucci website, it just says that the squirrel embodies the ""energy of the scent"" and that the scent is bright and cheerful.

And how does the cheerful squirrel smell? Quite clearly like mimosa, but nice!
I'm not a particular expert on mimosas, but I know ""Mimosa pour Moi,"" ""9.1 Komorebi,"" and ""Almond Cucumber"" well. And they all have in common that I find them not quite balanced and a bit too sweet.

This scent is different. Not extremely different; the difference is rather subtle at first glance, but in terms of consistency and especially in the development, I like it infinitely better. It really feels cheerful to me, somewhat airy-floral-bouncing. Like a squirrel jumping from treetop to treetop, if you want to stretch the motif on the bottle even further.
And above all - no joke - I find it smells somehow fluffy! Like a soft white rabbit on a spring meadow-fluffy.
A lively, energy-infused softness, not just a simple cuddly sofa.

I find neither winter nor pepper in this scent. I smell a very fine spring-like mimosa scent, initially with a slight almond undertone, beautifully unsticky in the development, and I believe there must be some green note in the scent that supports this fine balance.

Beautiful!"
A Midnight Stroll,07/06/2023,Mercer,M,78,,2,If you've smelled black shoe polish you've smelled this,"Take a pair of black leather shoes with some cypres shoe trees in them, open up a tin of polish and take a lighter and light the polish so that it softens up.

That's 100% identical to this smell. It's shoe polish, with some burning (incense) and then Cyprus.

I just can't imagine any scenario where you would want to smell like this, to the point that it's projecting more than an arms length off of you, and the silage trail is massive. In no way is this a safe blind buy.

It's uncanny how identical this smells to black shoe polish.

I will say, this is one of the best perfume bottle designs I've ever seen, I just wish it smelled as good as it looked."
A Midnight Stroll,02/19/2021,Landshark321,M,746,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,"Smooth incense with woody tones, very nicely done","A Midnight Stroll is my of Gucci’s collection The Alchemist’s Garden and is a lovely dark blend of incense, cypress, and cedar, so it fittingly is incense-dominant but leans wood as well. It’s dark and smooth, reminiscent in execution of By Kilian Incense Oud but fittingly with more incense and less oud. It’s not quite as ashy as Profumum Roma Olibanum—which I usually regard as one of the best incense-dominant fragrances in the market—so it’s an even smoother, slightly more mainstream/designer-esque incense-heavy mix that is nonetheless very wearable and fairly enjoyable, without much bite in the opening.

It performs pretty well overall, and in the US, is sold via the Gucci website and the department stores Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom, and its retailing pricing is $330 for 100ml. Also, I usually don’t gawk over bottle design the look of The Alchemist’ Garden’s bottles, most even more colorful than the black of A Midnight Stroll, are lovely.

Overall, A Midnight Stroll is great, and would certainly be made better by a lower price point, so I’d be curious to see if it’s available anywhere on the secondary market, and I’ll have to seek out some others in The Alchemist’s Garden.

A Midnight Stroll,12/13/2023,Linusjsl,M,1,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,7,A true treasure!,"Context: You are Erik Alfredson, leader of a Viking village, which will fight against a hostile village today.
You wake up to a tremendous thunder. It is dark, but the sun is already dawning through the window. You pull off the furs that kept you warm on this cool autumn night and get up. You give your wife, who lies next to you and is sleeping, a kiss on the forehead, knowing that you may not return from the journey you will embark on today. Upon arriving in the kitchen, you grab the bag of food that your wife has prepared for you. A loaf of bread and 2 wild boar legs. You put on your helmet, leave your wooden hut, and make your way through the forest to the village square. It is raining, and you walk briskly through puddles, the mud splattering up on you. Upon reaching the village square, you can already hear your men from afar, who will embark on the journey with you. They too know that not everyone will return. One of them is smoking a pipe, the scent of tobacco enveloping the village square. Now everything comes together. The scent of oud rising from the wooden huts around you. The leather of the furs you covered yourself with at night. The earthy smell that emanates from the rain-soaked ground. The tobacco from your men's pipes. The fear of what lies ahead. You set off towards your boat to embark on this journey together.

This describes this scent for me."
A Midnight Stroll,07/07/2020,TruuMax,M,75,,11,Search Without a Goal,"... I exhale the last big puff of my Parliament cigarette.

The cold, damp air mixes with the scent of fresh smoke.

For a few more meters, I carry the almost burnt-out butt with me and reflect.

On my life, my experiences, the things one survives, and what life still has in store for me. It is so peaceful... Just the stars, a gentle wind sweeping through the old town, and me.

This beautiful scent of a cold night slowly but surely drives away that of burnt tobacco, and I stroll further out of the city, heading towards the church. The damp earth and the typical church smell always fill this place with a very calm, albeit mysterious aura.

But now it is time to go home. Carelessly, I toss the butt onto the damp ground and stamp it out as I walk by... The first rays of sunlight of the day gently accompany me on my way home.

--------------------------------------------------------------

The fragrance truly smells like a nighttime walk in the rain. The first few minutes are almost aggressive and sharply smoky, but this quickly settles into a pleasant incense note. The cypress and cade wood together evoke for me that typical scent of a rainy evening in early summer.

It’s great for layering... But definitely as a base, so that the aggressive cigarette note can first fade away.

Very mysterious, especially at the beginning, still very masculine..."
A Gloaming Night,02/22/2024,Discoverduft,M,37,,1,Special but not fantastic,"tested thanks to a sample I had heard that it resembled harmonist fire hypnotizing, very present on social networks.

for me it's a disappointment, the scent is out of the ordinary it's undeniable, but it's a mixture of smoky smell with spices or even oud. At times like an apple cinnamon infusion mixed with nuit de feu lv.

A Gloaming Night,10/21/2025,paperdade,M,32,,1,"Epic home bringer that Gloaming Night, should've started the Alchemist's Garden with this.","Perfect craft, not sure how excitement and nostalgia can coexist so well like that, with the charm and style to it. It's a movie. Get the mature snug, not too much going on as far as multidirectional, got the rare standout, dense and solid. Opens up dark brown earthy, actually bit fresh fruity too, two days in don't get the Cinnamon yet, immediately Patchouli starts unfolding upon the bitter opening with sheer omnitemporal class, this was elegant in ancient times as well as having futuristicals to it in the present. All purpose, shut pretty much any scenario down with this because it will as well appeal to mass. Stunned by and very pleased with the blind purchase."
A Gloaming Night,04/24/2023,Ergreifend,F,528,,19,"Gucci, Gucci what have you done?","Unfortunately, another fragrance from the house of Gucci that comes across as so boring and insignificant that it is personally not worth 50€, let alone the over 300€ that are demanded on the Gucci website.

The scent itself starts quite subtly with patchouli, but this quickly comes across as extremely shallow. A puddle, scattered with insignificant, randomly chosen flowers lies under the moonlight, lazily casting shadows. A bit of pepper sprinkled in, some indifferent nutmeg, and also a touch of bay leaf. In the base, cinnamon creams with rose, but this does not come across as rich, rather distinctly pale, and there you have the whole structure of this magnificent specimen.

Longevity and sillage are just average, which is quite disappointing, especially since this is not a 20€ Bipa fragrance that can dissolve into nothing after a few hours. But here? Only the bottle looks appealing and has a touch of nostalgia. The content, however, is quite a flop.

This is not only noticeable with Gucci; other houses are also constantly declining when it comes to new releases. See my review of Prada's ""Paradoxe | Prada"" for reference.

Back in my youth, I much preferred Gucci Guilty, although it is not a milestone either, but certainly more interesting and rewarding than A Gloaming Night.

One can only ask: ""Gucci, Gucci what have you done?""
In this case, nothing at all, except for significantly raising the prices.
For a hint of boredom, well hidden, in a quite beautiful vessel..."
A Gloaming Night,10/12/2021,Ischgelroi,M,289,,8,Another flop from Gucci...,"Normally, I don't want to always give bad reviews, but unfortunately, A Gloaming Night has managed to receive a poor rating from me again. With Gucci perfumes, it's like with the brand's clothing: it looks great and is beautifully made on the outside, but that's about it. This comparison can also be applied to the perfume A Gloaming Night. The only truly great thing here is the bottle.

I didn't have high expectations for this Gucci after the last flop, Gucci 1921; the level could hardly sink any lower. Fortunately, the level hasn't dropped further, but it has only slightly increased. It's actually a shame that I have to be glad that the scent is just a flop and not a disaster.

The scent itself is simply boring without any character. I mainly smell cinnamon and soft patchouli, and although it's not listed as a note, a hint of rose. Unfortunately, cinnamon is the only note that can really assert itself, and I certainly didn't want a cinnamon scent here. I can only agree with ParfumAholic and say that I was hoping for something mystical and mysterious. A fragrance with only one note that is really recognizable seems very, very weak to me at almost €295, especially given the description of A Gloaming Night on Gucci's homepage. The scent also has no real development. A Gloaming Night just drifts along. The biggest problem for me is that it’s a scent that doesn't stick in your mind at all.

The longevity is also rather disappointing; after 6 hours, it was already over. The sillage is only above arm's length for an hour, and after just over 3 hours, it's already very close to the skin.

In conclusion, I can only say: Not like this, Gucci!

€295 for this joke is absolutely unacceptable!!!"
A Gloaming Night,09/25/2022,Kriskwiat,M,8,,2,Humble Love That Blooms in Attention,"The fragrance keeps every promise, but not everyone is capable of understanding its nature. Probably only a few. It cannot be defined, that’s true. Nor does it need to be. Its purpose is different. The scent begins with a magical opening, an attempt to describe it; the delicate-sweet and completely elegant trail of a charming woman, who humbly rains down on a red carpet. The continuation shows that her nature is reserved, yet this makes her stand out. Her uniqueness draws attention to itself."

Summer will be an excellent roll out opportunity for it, will give it more wear as I only just received it & its a like and keeper.. I won't say its anything revolutionary & surely there's something out there its similar to.
Find it at a cracking price & then its worth the purchase, at RRP i'd certainly not have bought it."
1921,06/15/2021,Haraella,F,35,,6,Gucci 1921…or…the wheel cannot be reinvented!,"I don't know what some people always expect! A new fragrance cannot always be the super new, never-before-seen composition.
There have been many brilliant perfumers who have created true masterpieces.
So, it's hard to create something completely new, especially when the fragrance pyramid is limited to just a few individual notes.
So. so what!
In my opinion, to put it simply, this is a fresh, crisp summer scent, as has been created many times before.
These days, people don't like to commit. The fragrance is marketed as ""unisex."" Strategically smart, as this allows for a broader audience appeal.
In my view, and this is my personal opinion, Gucci 1921 is a very classic men's fragrance.
I, as a woman, have tested it...and yes, I like it very much.
I also have no problem wearing it myself, especially now in the
summer.
And yet...I would find it better on a man, sexy and more interesting.
Whether one wants to spend a lot of money on such an average fragrance is up to each individual.
It's not bad, but the wheel has not been reinvented here."
1921,06/15/2021,Ischgelroi,M,289,HELPFUL REVIEW,13,This fragrance is a disgrace...,"I received my bottle of Gucci 1921 this morning. I was really looking forward to this fragrance from Gucci, especially given the high price for a fresh scent. Of course, I had to spray it on immediately.

Right after spraying, my expectation of a great and unique summer fragrance bursts. I start to think, what is this???

Unfortunately, I could answer that question just seconds later, and so could my girlfriend. Acqua di Giò pour Homme is my name, today disguised as Gucci 1921, with a little freshness and aquatic notes from Light Blue pour Homme Eau Intense added for improvement. I really don’t need to write anything about the notes or the development, because I could just buy the two previously mentioned fragrances or read the reviews about them. The result is the same.

I am really very disappointed with what Gucci and Alberto Morillas have produced. I really find it quite a disgrace, because we are truly talking about a fragrance twin here. I have rarely experienced such disappointment while testing.

The longevity is, what a surprise, the same as the two previously mentioned perfumes. After 5-6 hours, the whole drama is thankfully over. You can surely sense my disappointment and also my anger over this really poor release.

There is simply no reason for me to purchase Gucci 1921, unless I am looking for a new decoration in the form of a bottle for my apartment."
Gucci № 1,07/26/2014,ScentFan,F,336,,2,"Yes, it's brilliant","MasterLi's review inspired me to hunt down a miniature and, yes, Gucci 1 is one to be experienced. I love that swiftly after the accomplished top note. a little stank comes through from ambergris and musk rising into the indolic floral heart. This is awfully light on me, though. A watered miniature? Who knows? I'm just glad I got to smell this remarkable scent. With its bergamot-jasmine-musk-vanilla accord, it's almost a classic oriental, missing only amber. I've noticed that many of the perfumes I really adore have in excess of 20 notes -- this one lists 26. There was a time when great perfumers knew what to do with the olfactory version of ""everything but the kitchen sink."" Guy Robert certainly did. Fortunately, I have Amouage Gold that he also designed, reportedly using 120 of the best ingredients money could buy. Roberts said Gold Woman was his greatest creation to date. Wait, let me compare them ... Gold Woman is initially sweeter and in the drydown more powdery. It's clearly more complex, but to me it has a less subtle allure than his earlier stunner, Gucci 1. However, both are utter treasures. Now I'm wishing I had a full strength version of Gucci 1."
Gucci № 1,07/20/2014,MasterLi,M,376,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,The real deal,"They don't make them like this ANY more! This is what Gucci really is for people who remember the name and the brand. Very woody and slightly (sickly) floral. But at the same time warm and gives off a floral, almost herbal type vibe. This stuff is brilliant. Truly... They do NOT make them like this any more! (Which is a shame... A real shame). If you find this or have a bottle. Please, SAVOUR it. Make it last while you can. This is how real ladies used to smell like. Not like today's designer fragrance disasters."
Gucci № 1,08/10/2012,Iavas,F,15,,3,Found and Lost Again...,"...that was my encounter with Gucci No.1. About 3 years ago, I got a sample of it and at the first sniff, it was ""Yuck"", at the second ""Hmm..."" and by the third, I was in love. At 15, I was actually much too young for this scent, which is quite feminine, but I already knew back then that I liked heavy fragrances. This one is definitely among them.
To be honest, I am a bit overwhelmed by the huge fragrance pyramid of this scent; I can't really say what exactly I smelled - except for the sandalwood, which I always detect. The combination of patchouli and sandalwood with many flowers is actually a pretty good description of the fragrance. Heavy, sweet, but floral/herbaceous at the same time. At some point, a bottle of this EdP will find its way to me..."
Gucci № 1,06/24/2012,Florblanca,F,1168,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,22,I fear parfumo is my ruin...,"Many years ago, I briefly got acquainted with Gucci regarding ""Envy"". It wasn't that impressive, so this acquaintance wasn't pursued further. Last year, I came across a sample of two new Gucci fragrances, ""Guilty"" and ""Flora"". Neither of these led to a rekindling of the acquaintance.

Then, I was introduced to Gucci's no. 1 by a very nice expert, and a very dear parfumista (a thousand thanks at this point, dear Silverrain) gave me a drop of her precious extrait.

Even in the packaging, it smelled wonderful and somehow familiar. Then I applied it - being an extrait - very carefully, just a tiny drop, on my wrist.

What happened next is comparable to the reaction that cats show when you give them a valerian sachet to play with (cat owners know what I'm talking about *gg*). I was completely taken away and utterly unresponsive. It was indeed an olfactory orgasm that I experienced here.

Gucci no. 1 bears a great resemblance to the wonderful Fidji (Vintage!!!), but is distinctly more feminine and softer. The harsh beauty of Fidji is missing here.

I truly cannot pick out a single component here explicitly. It is such a fantastically composed whole, as I have hardly experienced before. The direction is soft, fine, bright, and femininely floral, the accords float like fine veils and alternate. Despite this wonderful perfection, the scent never becomes boring or monotonous.

Gucci no. 1 is a very sensual, very mature feminine fragrance that captivates me from the very first second. With a good sillage, it achieves an equally good projection, and the longevity is simply top-notch at a minimum of 24 hours!

I have done everything to track down this fragrance, as it is ""discontinued"", and I am very happy that I can use it extensively.
*
Addendum:

In the meantime, two bottles (one for spraying and one pouring bottle) of the no. 1 EdP have joined my collection.

The EdP offers a completely different facet of the fragrance. In the top note, a very fine, soft scent of night jasmine lingers here for about half an hour, as I know it from Spanish gardens. Very authentic, like those small, white flowers that release a warm, delicate floral aroma at night.

Only then does the well-known ""Fidji note"" slowly develop, which the extrait has already shown me.

Why would anyone let such a wonderful fragrance fade away without a sound?????"
A Song for the Rose,01/13/2022,Virginie,F,11,,2,"A Song for a Rose, hidden rose behind lemon balm","I just received my decant of this one. I was intrigued by the scent but frankly. It's not a rose perfume at all. The main accord I am getting is lemon balm, not even lemon grass. No woodiness. The rose stands in the back and you have to search for it because the lemon balm is so dominant. I do not dislike lemon balm since we always had it and I enjoyed squeezing the leaves to have my hands smelling lemon balm. I can imagine that I will actually enjoy this fragrance in hot weather because of this lemon balm and the freshness it brings. Just not what I had expected by the name and the listed notes. Would I buy a full bottle? most likely not, will I still enjoy my decant? hopefully in summer this year!"
A Song for the Rose,07/30/2019,Mörderbiene,M,46,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Painting Without a Canvas,"What’s inside is what it says on the label: roses.
Climbing roses, to be precise.
The clouds in the sky pass quickly, creating a wild play of shadows. Just when the rose bush is in the shade, damp and slightly sour, its blossoms immediately shine again in the sunlight, juicy and almost fruity.
The scent has a soapy undertone, not of the classic kind, but much more like modern liquid soap. This soapy note cannot quite find its place, sounding dissonant.
What’s special about this climbing rose is that there are no walls, no gates, no wires - the blossoms cling nowhere, they float. Like a painting without a canvas.
There is only the choir of roses with the soap, which misses the right note, and the musical accompaniment is absent. There is no background. No other little flowers, no green, no wood. Nevertheless, the scent radiates powerfully, lasting a long time.
This fragrance leaves me somewhat confused with its seemingly intentional superficiality, with its missing structure.
For me, it is exactly that: a stiff mask, a facade."
A Song for the Rose,06/25/2019,TruuMax,M,75,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,With the Guitar in the Rose Field,"And there I sat...

I sat in a field full of strong red roses... And while my eyes perceive a strong purple of lavender on the horizon, I strum Wicked Game by Chris Isaak to myself... By the way, this song has been my favorite since I was a child.

The most beautiful things in life don't have to be complicated. Sometimes all it takes is a guitar made of good wood, a few roses, and something clean and soapy on the horizon to make our happiness perfect.

It lasts for 7 hours, but the sillage becomes rather subtle after a maximum of 3 hours. Although it was never overwhelmingly dominant. At most, it starts off with a 2-meter radius. After that, it’s about half a meter where you can really perceive the scent.

Moreover, the bottle is a true masterpiece."
Guilty Oud,01/05/2022,Topfpflanze3,M,64,,3,Reputation Re-established,"I never thought that the rose/ oud genre had still so much room for uniqueness. I tried dozens of oud scents and a lot of them are very close or even redundant. As a collector of discontinued scents I had it on my radar for a long time, however 90€ bucks seemed pretty steep for a almost certain redundant (so I thought) blind buy. The rising prices along with the somewhat unique sounding blackberry note convinced me to click the buy button. And boy was I surprised...
The opening has a blast of realistic and juicy/tart blackberry. Not dusty like in Jubilation XXV or metallic like in SMW, just realistic and authentic. After the first few minutes in merges with the slightly jammy rose and creates an aura of its own. The combination ts just so clever, it balances the sweet floral character of the rose perfectly. The oud is dark and woody but far away from any fecal directions.
It defeinetly shares similarities to its predecessor Intense Oud, which also used a similar dry and woody oud. In some way you could see it as a fruitier and more playful version of the intense Oud.
Longevity is decent but not a beast like the real Middle Eastern oud scents.
During the last years the Guilty line or even Gucci as a whole was one of the most uninspired brands out there, but gems like this save the reputation - well done, I sincerely applaud for such a release!"

Gucci is cranking out the scents now? Well, I loved Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Homme from early 2017 and I love Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme from just a few months ago. And of course, I absolutely adore Gucci Intense Oud from late 2015. But is this new Gucci Guilty Oud any good? From my research on this new Gucci release, I learned that Gucci Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Homme and Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme and made the new Oud from notes within the two previous releases.

Guilty Eau pour Homme,03/25/2024,Systemshaak,M,15,,2,Light and Bright,"For those of you who are fond of the good ol' Italian cologne profile of citrus/bergamot, florals/orange in the middle, and a little bit of incense-ish stuff in the basenotes, this is a nice, clean one of those. The drydown is less woody or incense-heavy than you'd think out of a patchouli base. There's some powder in here.

I loved my old Prada Infusion d'Homme, which has a lot of the same elements in a very different presentation - that scent really punched you in the face with neroli. Guilty Eau is way more mellowed out - for better or worse. Don't expect ridiculous sillage out of it, but the remaining scent throughout the day is pleasant and personal."
Guilty Eau pour Homme,10/03/2016,Leimbacher,M,2870,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,I thought our story was over...,"Gucci Guilty PH - a pretty disastrous line, even if you disregard the excellent, discontinued predecessors in the Gucci universe. I really thought the line would be discontinued soon & slowly phased out... bam, in my face, says Gucci! There really is a new flanker ""Eau"" in the store - I never expected that! I thought Gucci was going new ways... apparently, they conjured up the lighter version of their failed confession completely behind my back last year. Or at least on board the ferry, where I took a 2-hour ride from Tallinn to Helsinki today. Curiosity wins, it had to go on my skin, maybe the ""relationship break"" with Guilty did us good...?

Partially yes, because I like ""Eau"". It combines the classic, quite boring Guilty PH DNA with a citrusy iris, almost a bit piercing, synthetic, metallic & high-pitched. A yawn meets cool detachment. The longer I test it & wear the sample as a refreshment after showering, the more the impression of the best Guilty (for my personal taste) is solidified. Its iced out attitude, the creamy iris-orange blossom powder somewhere between ""Dior Homme Sport/Cologne/Eau"", ""Kenzo Power (Cologne)"" & the original, appeals to me. The sparkling, very youthful & hyper-modern orientation is sexy & will surely do well in summer. However, at 10 degrees in Helsinki (today's testing conditions), it struggles. In ""GG PH Eau"" (this name can only be abbreviated!), everything is bright, white, lemony, on ice & casually relaxed - even the patchouli, which at least gives the fragrance some foundation. A wonderful scent, far above its superfluous brothers. It deserves more attention & should be tested by you - I would be very interested in your opinion & whether it can also reduce your Guilty prejudices a bit.

Bottle: very cool in this lighter, matte silver. Fits.
Sillage & longevity: never real strengths of the male Guiltys - here even more subtle & only 3 hours, as is fitting for an Eau.

Conclusion: no wonder it flies under all radars - an extremely defensive powder-citrus. Somewhere between the original GGPH & Dior Homme Sport. I like it, but overall it seems to be another unfortunate point in the misunderstood Guilty history. I've never warmed up to them, with this undercover Eau being the closest... Synthetic done right!"
Envy Me 2,01/26/2012,Missk,F,1357,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,5,"Sweet, musky green accords","I had almost given up on finding a Gucci fragrance that suited me, until I stumbled upon this little gem. In my opinion, this is by far the best Gucci fragrance, but knowing my luck it is a limited edition and has since been discontinued.

I disliked the original Gucci Envy Me, however Envy Me 2 is much more subdued and fresher. The orange in the top notes is delightful when blended with the violet. I very rarely enjoy fresh, summery scents, however Envy Me 2 had me with the first spritz.

The scent is very unique and soft. It is green in a way, but not in a sharp or bitter sense.

The drydown is very pretty with the patchouli and vanilla being only very subtle, making for a pleasant casual feel. Envy Me 2 is clean without being too soapy or shampoo-like. It has an almost powdery quality and a slight hint of sweetness that gives this fragrance character. I find Envy Me 2 to be very uplifting, and certainly long-lasting on the skin.

For now this fragrance is still available online and in some select stores, so I urge those who wish to try it or buy it, to hurry."
Envy Me 2,01/24/2014,Palonera,F,467,,19,Envy? Not at all...!,"I know it, I know - I carry a big name.
One that most people associate with luxury, glitz and glamour, striking extravagance, and obvious wealth.
Sometimes, this makes me a bit uncomfortable, because actually, you know, I prefer it quieter, more unobtrusive; I like to stay in the background.
That’s not something my family appreciates; they passionately stand in the spotlight, at the center, enjoying attention and publicity - in that sense, I am certainly something like the black sheep, even though great-grandfather Guccio, the founder of our dynasty, said years ago that a little more modesty would do his descendants good, and I would most resemble him.
My aunts and cousins didn’t like hearing that at all; I haven’t been invited to some family celebrations since then.
But that’s fine, then I don’t have to dress up.
I feel most comfortable in jeans and white shirts or T-shirts, and in summer, I like to wear light dresses - that doesn’t quite go with the haute couture that my lovely relatives love to wrap themselves in.
I also prefer to go out into the countryside to my weekend house and wander through forests and meadows, lie in the grass and count the clouds, let my bare feet dangle in the stream, and watch the sheep grazing, instead of spending my nights at noisy parties.
In the company, you’ll find me more in the office than in the studio or behind the catwalk - it’s quieter there, and they say I have a knack for our suppliers and a head for numbers, which is quite accurate.
It’s a simple life compared to that of my siblings, but it’s what I like, what I’ve always wanted.
No great heights from which one can fall deeply, and no deep valleys; our father has already taken care of that.
Am I happy?
Absolutely, I wouldn’t want it any other way - and so, when I think about it, maybe I am just a little bit enviable after all..."
Envy Me 2,10/09/2010,Woelfin,F,243,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,Delicious for a Quick Break,"Yes, how should I begin?
Maybe with a question for you: Do you expect something special from a brand like Gucci? Something that stands out from other fragrances?

In my opinion, yes. But as I have come to know Gucci, I will be regularly disappointed anyway. So maybe I should finally stop waiting for a miracle.

""Envy me 2"". Yes. The bottle is really pretty.
As for the scent:
Imagine a cool autumn day, with everything that comes with it. Golden rays of sunshine, some flowers in the front gardens of the houses, in one or another garden there is a pond where the goldfish swim around. Leaves are falling to the ground...

Golden rays of sunshine:
Undoubtedly, the scent feels pleasantly soft and cozy due to the rose in the heart note, a little warm. Just like the golden rays of sunshine on an autumn afternoon.

The flowers in the front gardens:
Yes, the floral notes cannot be denied even if one wanted to. - I don’t want to. And unfortunately, the scent feels as familiar as the neighborhood I see when I look out the window.

The garden ponds:
In contrast to the warmth from the floral notes, something very special comes through. Something that makes the scent feel pleasantly fresh again. However, I suspect that I am just imagining this. Who knows...

Colorful leaves:
That’s what autumn is all about. Leaves, colored in various hues, from different trees, diverse and beautiful.
... Well, I must disappoint you. Versatility? Recognition test? Not a chance.

Yes, it is a nice scent that really smells floral and ""good."" The intensity and longevity are also on point. One drop and everything smells like it.
BUT if this scent is missing from a collection, then there is really no need to be ashamed of it."
Envy Me 2,10/03/2009,Schnuffi,F,212,,2,Childhood Scent,"The scent somehow reminds me a lot of chewing gum or the scented stickers from Barbie that I had as a child.
It awakens childhood memories in me. I only wear it in very specific moments."
Envy Me 2,01/19/2023,Aromacloud,F,45,,3,"Light, uncomplicated, girlish","Hmm, is it even worth writing a review for a fragrance that hasn't been produced for a while and is becoming increasingly hard to find?

Yes. It is still available, and I once loved it and still like it today.

Yes, it is a rather ordinary, almost inconspicuous, and surely quite interchangeable fragrance for many. But for me, it was my first choice in my late twenties when going out, partying, flirting, or having ""a nice evening."" I, back then a sporty and agile type with a penchant for not necessarily stylish but free, bold, somewhat quirky, and always comfortable outfits, which were characterized by two things: large handbags and short leather jackets. And it fit perfectly.

This fragrance is light, fresh, floral, exuding a charm that is not primarily stylish but still beautifully present. I smell pastel, lemon yellow (no, no lemon in the fragrance development), and a kind of lime green. It is cheerful and girlish. A bit flighty, but likable and totally uncomplicated.

Envy me 2 starts off with a violet note, artificial. Not bad, but artificial. A little rose, the almost white one with the pink, slightly frayed leaf edge, soon emerges, or rather many small bush roses perhaps. The floral note remains from beginning to end, the minimal sandalwood trace and a bit more patchouli towards the end give the fragrance increasing grounding; depth would be too much to ask for, rather a light warmth. It stays predominantly floral on me, slightly sweet, fresh, delicate green, and airy.

I still have a bit left that I occasionally like to wear. As a reminder of another decade, I find it not necessarily fitting for me today, but I still like it. And I keep it in loving memory.

Would I buy it if it were still available? Yes, I would, for my daughter."
The Heart of Leo,08/23/2025,Omnipotato,M,388,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Smooth woody fruity creation,"The low rating for this one is crazy. The Heart of Leo is a fantastic woody-spicy-fruity scent where the notes don't really capture the complexity. It reminds me of Armani Privé - Bleu Lazuli or Gajah Mada where it's this smooth unspecific sweet/sour fruity note atop a unisex/masculine leaning woody base. There are a bit of oriental notes, but it doesn't really take the resinous route as the notes suggest. I'd say it's more of a cedarwood/sandalwood and patchouli along with a smooth amber to bridge the gap between the fruity notes and the dry woods. There is also a bit of leather, I think it's a similar accord to The Voice of the Snake but way in the background.

Not really getting the complaints about the performance either. The sillage is subtle, sure, but that might be by design. Not every fragrance has to enter before you into a room. Pricing is expensive at retail, sure, but it's available at Jomashop currently for $185 which I think is a very decent price for a fragrance of this caliber."
The Heart of Leo,01/21/2025,AnaOnegina,F,6,,1,Leo ist wahrscheinlich doch kein leo,"Ich habe eine kontroverse Meinung zu diesem Parfum:
Einerseits hat der Parfum mit dem ersten Sprühstoß mein Herz erobert anderseits verstehe ich, dass für so eine schwache Leistung ist dieser Duft keine 350€ wert.
Die erste Noten sind von Johannisbeere und Leder, die ich echt einzigartig fand, das hat besonders, mit Charakter gerochen, aber dafür wiederum feminin. Die Komposition passt perfekt für die Dates und für einen Abend in einer Bar.
Ich habe mich erstmal in den Duft tatsächlich verliebt.
Aber S/H haben leider zutiefst enttäuscht. Der Duft blieb ohne Nachzusprüchen nicht länger als 3 Studen und wird am Ende ganz schwach. Alles andere, als eine Komposition die dem Image von „Leo“ unterstützen sollte.
Ich hätte gesagt, Parfüm ist maximal 150-180€ wert, für 350 kann man deutlich qualitativere Sachen holen. In dem Preissegment halten sich viele Parfüms bis 8-12 Stunden, wo man die am Ende noch ganz stark wahrnimmt."
The Heart of Leo,08/17/2024,Lauser93,M,1199,,4,A Fruity-Powdery Experience,"In the end, The Heart of Leo actually surprised me positively, as it has not been rated very well on Parfumo. I find the scent quite pleasant, though not spectacular. The longevity on my skin is around 10 hours with a rather mediocre sillage.

Since the complexity of the fragrance is limited, it makes little sense to talk about top, heart, or base notes. The scent is predominantly fruity, sweet, and very powdery with blackcurrants. Additionally, I detect a certain woodiness with a spicy-herbaceous aroma of woodruff. I cannot identify any incense or myrrh here.

For me, The Heart of Leo is quite good, feminine but still too expensive for what is offered here. I thank Kamyar for the decant."
The Heart of Leo,05/07/2024,Leohof,M,5,,1,Disillusioned - A name alone won't save it,"Update:

I had the opportunity to test the fragrance twice at the airport, and I must unfortunately say that my first sample was contaminated and diluted. The user who sold me the sample is no longer around... Nevertheless, the price for what you get is too high. It also doesn't come across as masculine.

The sharp smell at the beginning is absent. It starts with berries and then becomes very powdery. Unfortunately, up close. The incense is hard for me to grasp. Still, the first review was too harsh.

I've adjusted the review! The statement below still holds true :). Just without the hairspray smell.

------

Man, oh man… it could have been great, but it isn’t…
When the fragrance was announced, I was really hyped. This trio of notes appealed to me!!! At €345 for 100ml, I expected niche quality, which I think is justified at that price.

Unfortunately, in my eyes, a lower quality is delivered here than some drugstore scents. At least olfactorily, it’s a real disappointment for me! I will now try to describe what I perceive with goodwill.

Fragrance applied to a clean wrist with 2 good sprays. First, a sting in the nose. Then the blackcurrant comes out like a candy or a wild fruit tea… Then, relatively quickly, I only perceive the chemical smell of super glue and hairspray. With a lot of goodwill and imagination, I still smell something slightly leathery, but that’s just my imagination. Unfortunately, I don’t perceive incense and myrrh.

Now for the closing statement:

Could have been better - more quality, more amore… it didn’t smell like a lion, more like a chemistry set, eh!
A name doesn’t save the scent either. After a short time, Gucci is done, str...

For me, a flop; luckily, I only got a sample. Recommendation! Spend your money on another fragrance :)"
Guilty Eau,07/09/2023,DogiCoco,F,637,,1,Simple lilac,"I'll keep this short and sweet, as there is not that much to say about this scent.
Like the name suggests, this is a light and soft version of Guilty. To me, this smells mainly like lilac and warm white musk, unfortunately I don't get the fruity notes of strawberry and litchi. It's a little aquatic in the opening and dries down powdery with a hit of a dusty pollen vibe.

It's a nice scent for spring time, but quite weak and a little boring to me. Maybe it could work if you're looking for a really light, inoffensive, work-appropriate lilac. But honestly, the other Guilty flankers aren't that dark and heavy either, so I would rather get one of those.
This one is just okay to me, bordering on a weak like, but nothing to write home about."
Guilty Eau,08/14/2017,pudelbonzo,F,2405,HELPFUL REVIEW,13,Morning Air - Morning Scent,"On Thursday, the anniversary of the day my husband and I met will be celebrated for - I don’t know how many times.

I still need to find out the exact number, otherwise he gets offended.
He knows it perfectly well, of course.

I always have to check our marriage duration painstakingly in the wedding ring when asked, which he responds to with an annoyed eye roll.
I save myself by saying: It feels like just yesterday!

He knows that I am disorganized.
Nevertheless, I can expect a gift.
I sense morning air or rather morning scent.

I envision the pleasantly light yet expressive Guilty Eau as my gift wish.
I know he generally likes the Guilty fragrances, and only what doesn’t bother him is given as a gift.

It is delicately aquatic - but not thin, rather beautifully transparent.
A soft lychee wafts towards me, accompanied by anise.
We both like lilac, and it is pleasantly non-soapy.
The wild strawberries come straight from the forest.
I am so wild for your strawberry mouth - comes to my mind.
Musk gives a golden morning shimmer.

A bright, joyful scent - weightless like the butterflies that swirled around us - ahem - ""some"" years ago.
This tingling feeling can certainly be revived by Eau."
Guilty Love Edition MMXXI pour Homme,04/30/2022,Duftor,M,26,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Good Mood Fragrance,"A very well-crafted perfume in the Guilty line. I was intrigued by it because it is also called Love Edition. Upon application, I immediately notice - it is 1 to 1 Guilty as you know it from men's perfumes, it has that citrusy, bitter lavender note, and on top of that, this one is even a bit sweeter. Nice woody citrus, that’s all it needs.
The scent surprisingly lasts quite a while; you can smell it very lightly afterwards, but it is always nice to spray it on again.
This fragrance is available for men and women (pour Femme), but I would argue that Pour Homme actually leans more towards a unisex scent, as it appears elegantly fresh and is not very masculine.
As already mentioned, it definitely has something from the classic Guilty perfumes, and anyone who enjoys wearing those would not go wrong with this one."
Guilty Absolu de Parfum pour Femme,11/05/2025,Eriele,F,322,,1,Orientcracker,"The Gucci family has welcomed a new member, just in time for autumn/winter, when hopefully it will be cool again on the shelves. First of all, it should be said that this is an absolutely intense and overwhelming scent.

The opening with bitter almond is reminiscent of marzipan and slightly fruity. But then it gets serious. Spicy and herbaceous with patchouli and slightly floral with the roses, which smell a bit musty and autumnal. As if you were smelling a bouquet of roses that was placed on the cemetery for All Souls' Day in December. Morbid charm for those who like it that way. To me, the scent now smells a bit off.

But then it continues intensely. Coffee dominates heavily, but not freshly brewed; rather, it’s the scent that wafts into your car on the A1 in Bremen. When the wind comes from a well-known coffee roastery. This typical scent of the area now mixes with the morbid, slightly sour opening. A powerful blend that will surely find its admirers, especially since it also includes the currently trendy vanilla. But not the stuff from the baking aisle, rather a strong, room-filling vanilla supported by tonka.

For those who love intense oriental fragrances and want to make a statement with the motto ""Stand out at any cost,"" this scent is a good fit. For me, it’s a bit too much of everything and too disharmonious. I prefer subtler orientals in winter.

Now for the longevity. Today is Wednesday, and I wore the scent on Sunday. The scent is still present on my skin and surrounds me. And it was just a tiny drop. Fortunately, the musty notes are gone, and only patchouli with vanilla remains. But still, it feels too clingy for me."
Guilty Absolu de Parfum pour Femme,10/25/2025,Kerkyra74,F,669,,4,I absolutely like it,"Boozy plums, like port wine, but it also has a coffee note, more bitter through patchouli and rose than Black Opium le Parfum. When this port wine/amaretto note fades, the fragrance becomes creamier with tonka and then unfortunately also a bit uninteresting. It's a pity that the top note doesn't last longer. Definitely worth a test for fans of Black Opium le Parfum, Ghinza Datura, and Amore Cafe."
A Floral Verse,10/18/2025,paperdade,M,32,,1,Higher up Imperial Tea,"Think byKilian Imperial Tea, with the on and on incredible Alchemist's Garden cozy and warm smoke settle. Get bit green creamy milk, like that moment in Memoir Man in the opening, fourth day amply sprayed on arm, gets earthier, more and more woody like one wouldn't believe. More on the bitter side, balmy green, close tie with the Tea note, but Jasmine predominant, with the gentle musk to it all. Get the serene joyful, uplifter, an everyday pick, all purpose casual aand doesn't get loud if oversprayed. Personally don't get the spa sameness almost at all? Got it the first two times/days, in the imediate opening, lasted for 30 min tops, then next days barely got it anymore towards and in the drydown, so yeah, again: an Aura Tea scent, must try it out on own skin. Very pleased and surprised by the blind purchase, luving the line more and more"
Hortus Sanitatis,04/18/2021,Ngarcia,M,21,,2,The big brother of Gucci Guilty Absolute,"This perfume smells like a Gucci Guilty Absolute but without cypres and with something herbal instead.

Morillas sometimes doesn't declare the leather within the notes (Black Tie example) but if there isn't leather, there is some alchemy because to a earthy accord of vetiver and papyrus doesn't smell.

Linear, but pleasant, one more point of quality than Guilty Absolute, you may think that they are very similar until you have them hand by hand, the price is excessive, but it is still a full-bodied leather perfume worth trying."
Hortus Sanitatis,01/28/2025,ManuParfum,M,9,,1,Damp darkness,"Strange smell.

It comes out with the fresh smell of ginger and herbs and spices but quickly turns into something deeply earthy, like a vetiver or a very earthy patchouli. If the name wanted to convey the smell of a medicinal garden, it is quite well achieved, it would be a waterlogged garden (papyrus) with very damp soil. The sum of notes also leads me to think of a slightly camphoric or medicinal smoke."
Hortus Sanitatis,03/13/2020,Gschpusi,F,302,,0,Sometimes less is just right!,"Abstinence would be fine too. So, short and sweet:
Based on the fragrance notes, I couldn't resist. I like ginger - I consume it daily. I like wood and vetiver because they are light green and fresh. I like cedarwood because it also has a fresh and spicy scent.
All in all, I was looking forward to Hortus-Sanitatis.
But what a disappointment for my expectations *sigh*
Ginger is so inconspicuous, as if it has slipped under some fruits in the fruit bowl and is just rotting there. Vetiver is very dominant. I like it and it conveys the feeling of a recovery garden, wellness oasis, and health. Cedarwood... wtf?! Where did they dig that up? Sharp, captivating, pitch black, and cold. I almost thought of incense, but the bad kind. The only thing that could save this scent would be papyrus wood. Fresh, sparkling, and a touch sour. But there is too little of that to tone down the cedar.
Earthy yes, green, mossy like after a rain shower, but unfortunately again ""cold"".
Definitely too sharp and above all cold for me. It reminds me a bit of medicine. The price? Almost outrageous."
Hortus Sanitatis,04/04/2020,Rene72,M,37,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,The Herbal Book of 1491 - Masterfully Realized,"The Hortus Sanitatis is a book of herbal medicine that was printed in Mainz in 1491 (!). And this is astonishingly well captured in this fragrance. On one hand, the herbal notes do remind one of medicine. At the same time, there is a mustiness described below; I would rather say the smell of old walls, old linen. It is likely inspired by ancient papyrus, which absorbed these scents when the Hortus Sanitatis was in its time. This is how a book smells that has been stored and breathed for a long time, perhaps in a monastery where such herbs were cultivated and processed into tinctures in the 15th century.
The scent reminds me of a visit to the dungeon in Hamburg, where visitors walk through scenes of the dark history of the Hanseatic city. To be precise, the station that reminds me is dedicated to the theme of the plague. A monk in a linen robe in a laboratory with numerous tinctures describes to the visitor how much the Hanseatic city of Hamburg suffered from the plague. That sounds worse than it is. The scent does not stink like the plague!
One can only observe a very extreme exaggeration of this scent there.
I could swear that I could smell an animalic note. Both in the dungeon, where the scent of bodily fluids was mixed with the herbal tinctures. But also, the perfume Hortus Sanitatis contains something animalic for me in its later development. A certain smokiness also emerges. The scent transforms a lot; time and again, a different herbal note seems to come through. Although not listed in the fragrance pyramid, various herbs are present. I suspect sage, which in nature also possesses a certain animalic quality, can sometimes smell like stale urine, chamomile, thyme, rosemary, tarragon, and especially bay leaf. A monastery garden with herb beds, a laboratory where tinctures simmer and smoke over an open flame, and in the midst of it, a book of recipes and effects, the Hortus Sanitatis, which absorbs these scents.
I believe Morillas has masterfully realized the theme and created a wearable perfume from this challenge (because who wants to smell like an old musty book or a medieval plague station).
I do not want to deny that this perfume is demanding. But there is so much to smell, and it does not scream for compliments. It envelops the wearer with a mysterious aura."
Hortus Sanitatis,12/29/2020,Ischgelroi,M,289,,4,The Lorsch Medicine Book to spray on?,"I must say right away that I am actually not a fan of Alberto Morillas' creations; most of the time, they are too linear or boring for me. Hortus Sanitatis is an exception, this fragrance is truly unique and special. However, I am still surprised that something like this comes from Gucci, as the brand has mostly been represented in Douglas or Müller until now. Hortus Sanitatis is definitely not a perfume that will receive many compliments; rather, it may even provoke negative reactions, as it is 100% not a scent for the club or anything like that. Hortus Sanitatis really reminds me of traditional herbal medicine from the Middle Ages; I imagine being in a monastery in the year 800. The healing arts have just been invented, and the whole monastery smells of the monks' homemade medicine. I must honestly say, though, I cannot answer whether I will acquire a bottle of Hortus Sanitatis, as there is almost no opportunity to wear this scent."
Envy,07/02/2024,MrsGuerlain,F,548,,1,Quality,"I am the very lucky owner of this wonderful scent. When I spray it I think ‘quality’ at once. It never tops amazing me, because even though it is quite linear it still shifts between the notes. The fragrances balances between sour and green and woody/floral. The mix is simply great. When I wear this I feel clean and fresh all through the day - and I mean all day because Envy edp is long lasting. More than eight hours on my skin. Sillage is sociable.
The bottle is a monolith - dark glass. So beautiful!

I have tested fragrances (Tom Ford vert Bohème, Hermes monsieur Li) that are said to be similar to you, but none could compare - envy I miss you ..."
Envy,04/19/2010,Kalix,F,87,,11,The big beautiful sister with a quirky character,"In search of a bright floral, softly green scent, I stumbled upon the Gucci Envy line years ago, equipped with a friend's recommendation to definitely try Envy Me by Gucci.

So I started with the small playful sisters of Envy Eau de Parfum, which I found nice, but they were a bit too ""silly"" in a positive sense for me. Can a floral scent not also be elegant and seductive, mature? It can! Especially when the ""musk ox takes it by the horns"" and it is called Envy Eau de Parfum.

As a vanilla addict, I quickly tend to distance myself from a fragrance if at least a hint of vanilla is not used. But now I had found Envy EDP by Gucci, and the vanilla hadn't even been a misstep during its creation. The bottle - pitch black, very elegant - caught my eye immediately.

Consistently, only flowers were used in the heart. There they merge and acquire a slightly lemony note. The iris, jasmine, and powdery magnolia show the hyacinth where its place is, beneath them. By the way, I have the feeling that the woods were indeed used in the top note - rather unusual.

With the warming musk note in the base, the floral slightly lemony core remains seductively on the skin, truly for an eternity. The longevity is superb, without being intrusive. This extravagant quirky scent is wearable for any occasion. My preferred seasons are more spring/summer. In winter, however, please do bring on the beloved vanilla bomb!"
Flora Emerald Gardenia,07/07/2025,Layaliii,F,72,,2,Watermelons in a Lotus Garden,"I love this scent. I received it as a gift 5 years ago and it is still in my collection today. I am so sad that this fragrance is no longer available for purchase
That's why I don't dare to use too much of it, which is silly because it is very weak and you actually have to overspray
I am still looking for an alternative that is preferably a bit cheaper
To me, it smells like pear, watermelon, and lotus

Flora Emerald Gardenia,11/27/2020,pudelbonzo,F,2405,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Off to the Tropics!,"I love the color green - not without reason did I marry a green-skirted person.

And so my eyes were also drawn to the beautiful green bottle - which doesn’t promise too much, because ""green"" is the theme in this Gucci collection.

But it’s not our home garden green; instead, long vines dangle before my eyes, with cute little monkeys swinging on them - accompanied by exotic animal sounds.
A toucan flutters by and the colorful parrots tell me something in a foreign language.

No question - I have landed in the tropics.

But there is no steamy heat there - rather a pure cool air.
This is likely due to the flowing aquatic fruits - like pear and watermelon - topped with fresh lemon.
No dark green, sweat-inducing jungle feeling - instead, a gentle breeze blows here.
The exotic flowers appear enchanting - but soft.
Sandalwood embraces you and the cedar has a slightly smoky effect.

A peaceful atmosphere where one likes to linger.

In the jungle, the quiet jungle - the lion sleeps tonight ..."

Mmmm... such a sweet and fruity explosion

Eau de Gucci Concentrée,08/14/2024,SwabGames,M,86,,1,Fragrance for beginners,"Applying this fragrance to your hand, you can hear the sweet aroma of ylang-ylang and in the distance a mandarin candy. A very cool combination, somewhere playful and cute. Jasmine, lily of the valley and lilac open in the middle. A very pleasant floral scent, very reminiscent of a summer day when all the flowers begin to smell. As a result, it smells of both moss and wood. It feels like you walked into an old wooden abandoned house covered in moss."
Eau de Gucci Concentrée,04/12/2015,Turandot,F,839,,38,One doesn't always have to be reasonable,"It is, of course, a stroke of luck to find a fragrance from 1982 for 45,-- online. It is, of course, unreasonable to order it, as the likelihood that it has not aged gracefully is quite high. Well, sometimes I am unreasonable, and sometimes I just get lucky.

There is nothing to criticize about my splash bottle, and the previous owners probably did not know what a fine fragrance they had. The packaging was still original, but the cellophane was already brittle, yellowed, and shattered like glass. The perfume itself is perfectly fine. Not even the top note shows a hint of fatigue. Since I do not plan to open a fragrance museum and wait until Eau de Gucci Concentree is completely gone, I have decanted the fragrance into a spray bottle, as otherwise, I would simply wear it too infrequently. But now I do so with growing enthusiasm.

On the day of the order, I had not yet looked into the pyramid and actually expected to receive a pure fresh chypre, as I had never encountered it in my professional environment before. The ""Eau de.."" fragrances from that time are usually unisex, suitable for everyday wear, and occasionally interchangeable. Therefore, I was all the more surprised and delighted that the perfume turned out to be light and summer-appropriate, yet expressive and a floral scent without sweetness and with a rather even rugged progression. Even though no oak moss is listed here, I am not sure if a tiny bit of it was not used after all.

Lilac, jasmine, and violet sound cutely romantic, but I cannot really pin down any of the notes, and the bitter citrus opening leaves no doubt that Eau de Gucci Concentree can be worn unisex, provided the potential wearer is not fixated on oriental, oud, amber, and similar rather heavy fragrance notes. Vetiver and sandalwood keep each other in check in the base, so the fragrance cannot be sorted into one corner or another.

I refrain from falling back into the lament about perfume culture, which is no longer what it used to be. Nevertheless, I enjoy conjuring up the aura of past times with a few spritzes of Eau de Gucci Concentree.

Some may find it pointless or unreasonable to write a comment about a perfume that is hardly available anymore, but - see title - a comment does not necessarily have to drive the sales figures of current perfumes, but simply expand our fragrance horizon. I still enjoy unearthing buried treasures."
Flora by Gucci 1966,12/12/2020,Interdit,F,58,,1,Queen Rose,"Definitely not unisex, this fragrance screams feminine in all its glory!

A rose is a rose, and boys, this is a Queen rose - not a King.
Pure, enchanting sophistication, the hint of dusty Patchouli perfectly balanced on soft, juicy, pinky petals. No pepper, but a veil of musk to envelope in such suave, angelic embrace. It murmurs of that nonchalant sassiness typical of women confident about their place in the world, and consequently, unafraid of their sexual appeal, a charm aquired with each experience.
I don't see a man pulling this off, or a girl. This is a shapely, mature, happy woman in my mind. Smiling to herself, she slowly walks downtown, content and carefree, unaware of others' attention. For she's an indomitable spirit, and time can't change that.
It's a rose, a Queen among Ladies, and she doesn't care.

Such a pity that sillage is not as intense, and longevity only a dream. This would have been my perfect rose."
Flora by Gucci 1966,10/22/2020,Connie,F,333,,5,Heavenly... This is how I believe angels smell...,"If I had to choose a single fragrance as the absolute number 1 of the most beautiful scents ever, it would be Gucci Flora 1966... It simply doesn't get more feminine and sensual than this.. A cozy, creamy scent that stays relatively close to the skin..

An indescribable fragrance.. I love bergamot scents but here the bergamot is simply out of this world.. Soft, creamy and a bit powdery.. The other notes, like bourbon pepper, peony, musk, and a hint of patchouli dance subtly in the background and make this scent incredibly beautiful for me...

Unfortunately, the sillage is quite weak on my skin.. Longevity is average... The bottle is deep black, incredibly elegant and beautiful..."
Flora by Gucci 1966,05/23/2015,MariellaMmmh,F,215,,3,Undark Grace in a Bag,"Anyone expecting a darkly nuanced scent here will be disappointed. Once you press the sprayer, you are enveloped in a huge load of radiant flowers. At first, you smell a light citrus freshness paired with a hint of vanilla spiciness. The roses mentioned in the fragrance pyramid are immediately present - and they don’t leave. Dominating the scent from start to finish is the peony. In my opinion, the rose garden is accompanied by other floral undertones, but they are very much in the background and hardly noticeable. I'm not entirely sure what it is. Under torture, I would probably guess lily of the valley, but hopefully, that won't happen to me.
The scent development unfolds very slowly - gradually you notice that the fragrance has reached the base: The floral notes still remain, but they no longer radiate as they did at first; instead, they become duller, softer; the scent is at this point only very close to the skin. What I find very pleasant is that the base, despite a woody undertone, comes across as quite fresh. Personally, I don’t like, well, let’s be honest, I HATE it when a floral-fresh scent is suddenly overwhelmed by a tree with a click. Here, everything goes hand in hand, it feels very harmonious.

Overall, this Flora variant is rather understated. Unlike the original Flora, which I find very sweet and striking, it exudes a graceful charm characterized by understatement. Subtle notes that mostly stay close to the skin envelop the wearer in a ""just showered"" cloud, sometimes appearing a bit cool, but never distant.

At every stage of the scent development, I like the fragrance. An absolute Mari candidate. I really enjoy rose scents - Chloé is one of the fragrances I wear the most. Rosy, fresh, slightly spicy, soft, like just showered - ah! Based on the fragrance pyramid displayed here, I would have guessed this direction as well. However, Gracy Flora reminds me more of the Stella line from Ms. McCartney. I had several Stellas and would buy them again anytime. Nevertheless, I didn’t feel comfortable with FloraGrace. Despite its subtle and elegant character, it annoyed me over time so much that I got headaches from it.
I gifted it to my mom. I really like it on her. (But keep the skin chemistry discussions away from me!) I enjoy it when she wears it and relish from afar the wafting cloud she emits as she glides past me.

Despite the happy ending, it should be mentioned that I don't think the scent is as good as the price suggests. I can't see any difference in quality compared to other Gucci fragrances. Whether Gucci wanted to launch a more exclusive scent similar to Chanel's ""Les Exclusifs"" line or Armani's Armani Privè fragrances, I don't know. If so: missed the mark. It could be better. For a fragrance in this price category, I expected something more; perhaps my expectations were too high. Maybe the reference to Grace, the beautiful and dearly lost Monegasque, is enough to justify the price. If you can't go to Monaco to wrap yourself in the wealth and beauty of the South of France, you can wrap yourself in this scent. It's still cheaper...

I have once again been reminded that a well-sounding and promising fragrance pyramid resembling other perfumes that one enjoys wearing does not automatically mean that this applies to every scent. One more reason not to make blind purchases anymore.
Whether this fragrance is something for you or not, you will have to find out for yourself. Apparently, it is still available, despite being a limited edition. And well, the Flora-patterned little bag is quite cute..."
L'Arte di Gucci,09/11/2025,MrsGuerlain,F,548,,1,Eye candy,"This is ‘an old woman’s perfume’… if you ask my partner. He does not like aldehydes. And yes, I understand the comparison with Montana’s Parfum de Peau. L’Arte di Gucci EdT and Parfum de Peau have so much in common, when it comes to being late eighties/early nineties fragrances with all the power and ado there is to it. They share jasmine, rose and amber but they also share the leathery/spicy/floral accords. Rich and soapy, long lasting and loud - that is my kind of fragrance (when I am alone).
My nose is simply not skilled enough to make out the many nuances in this wonder, but I can appreciate it, and I can admire the gorgeous bottle. Actually, here is the Arte in L’Arte: the bottle.
I have the one with black top decorated with delicate golden details. I adore the asymmetrical bottle with the most deliciously looking golden juice. I assume that extremely interesting pictures can be and have been taken of this masterpiece. Just look at the photos taken by Parfumo members - this bootle is eye candy, just waiting to be gazed upon. I look forward to the day when I get my hands on the EdP. Then I shall start taking pictures of the two together. They are a handsome couple. And I am looking forward to see how much stronger the EdP can be, because the EdT is, well, really strong.
L’Arte di Gucci EdT offers a journey back in time to my late teens and early twenties. A powerful potion in a marvelous vessel.

L'Arte di Gucci,11/12/2021,Morpheus1,M,72,HELPFUL REVIEW,10,A Chypre for Non-Chypre Fans / Gucci's Discontinued Masterpiece,"Once again, this is a fragrance where the name could not have been chosen more aptly.

L'Arte di Gucci, a shy, delicate Chypre mythical creature of modern perfumery from Gucci, that hides away. Not many know it or get to see it.

Its prices are astronomical, and this is not only due to its rarity but also its quality.

A Chypre that breaks conventions and follows its own, modern path.

It impresses with a sparkling, bright aldehydic lightness for a Chypre.
Additionally, it is underscored with floral fruity elements.
Subtle green leathery nuances can also be perceived as it develops.

Somewhat lighter than the EdP, but still expressive.
An elegant fragrance that is also very well suited for more festive occasions or evening events.

The Rembrandt or Picasso among Gucci's fragrances.

I searched for this fragrance for a very long time and had it on my wish list.

Yesterday, it finally happened.
Found the treasure as a 50ml splash.
The joy was immense.

At some point, I also need to get the EdP in the large bottle (even rarer), of which I am lucky to already own 3 minis.

Inquiries among parfumo users have always been denied; no one gives up the black EdP bottle once they have it.

Thus, the search continues for new treasures and masterpieces in the fragrance universe."
Love at your Darkest,10/24/2023,Shemsmeller,M,206,,1,The mistake of Sauvage edt generic,"tested following a purchase through a sample. This fragrance is really perfect for fall and preparing the transition from summer to winter.

what struck me in this perfume was the presence of an anise smell, it reminds me a little of PDM's Pegasus while being very different. It also reminds me of this slightly aniseed smell of Sauvage Dior in edt but the generic version which in my opinion was a complete failure compared to the original perfume.

nevertheless the discovery of this scent was a pleasant novelty for me. It’s really a perfume that I recommend for all ages, I find it more masculine.

the sillage is honest without being incredible, for longevity count between 5 and 7 hours so it lasts for a day's work.

the price is high, not very accessible but with it you will really have the impression of feeling differently from others."
Love at your Darkest,06/17/2022,Fegefeuer,M,9,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,27,Gucci's Absolution,"Whoever names Gucci's fragrances may be a true poet, but the copywriters trample him underfoot. Like an overanalyzed poem in sixth-grade German class, the author has been silenced, and you can't convince me otherwise.

I Loved You At Your Darkest is not only a magnificent album by the Polish death metal band Behemoth, but also a phrase that stems from the Bible. Now, despite numerous quotes on embroidered pillows, the phrase does not actually appear in the holy scripture, but it summarizes Romans 5:8. A dark passage about the death of Jesus Christ, who did not die for humanity because it is worthy, but because it sins. Thus, humanity was at its lowest point and was nevertheless showered with love. The incarnate absolution, if one believes in such a thing. The sacrifice for the unworthy.

It would be a wonderful sacred analogy for the fragrance. The ceremonial incense, the blasphemous pepper, and the wooden cross. My German teacher would be proud of how much meaning I could extract from my nose. Whether the cross was made of cedar is another question. But what does Gucci write on their website? Love seems to shine through the darkness, like a falcon cutting through the sky? Someone really tried hard to invent something profound for the name of the perfume, and I am not a fan. Thank God the scent is better than the missed opportunity for impressive storytelling.

After receiving my sample, I sprayed heretical amounts on my left forearm. Seeing a whole milliliter missing hurt like nails through hands and feet. When I pressed my oversized Silesian nose against my skin, the pepper first revealed itself. Unfortunately, it is by no means as authentic as I know it from ""Armani Privé - Bois d'Encens | Giorgio Armani."" The pepper is very shy and mild, showing rather the minty facets it can have when freshly ground and is blunt. The incense quickly joins with its ethereal smoke, as if it followed a shining star to the manger. So light and cool that it fits every season and strongly reminds me of ""Series 3: Incense - Kyoto | Comme des Garçons."" The pepper gives everything a certain depth but remains in the background.
A fleeting sweet side appears briefly, presenting a fleeting floral accord before it suddenly turns into soap, fabric softener, and freshly washed laundry, which I never expected. The perfume seemingly does not know what it wants to be, constantly changing its shape, yet keeps my nose intrigued on the skin. An exciting olfactory cinema, and that was just the first hour!
The actual expectation of the fragrance pyramid only reveals itself with the passage of time. The pepper becomes noticeably sharper, the cedarwood finally shows itself, and out of nowhere comes burnt butter, but probably only because I associate pepper so much with food. Every time I inhale this scent, I smell something new, but it remains consistently smoky-spicy.

If I had to describe it visually, it would be a small stone chapel in the Italian mountains with wooden benches. The door is open, the cold memory of incense lingers in the air. The pastor has hung laundry outside and is grinding black pepper in a mortar because he is making Cacio e Pepe for himself and a few villagers later. Sorry, that's all I can write at the moment.

The fragrance can ideally be worn to confession because it is very close to the skin and, with a bit of luck and God's blessing, would only fill the claustrophobia-inducing confessional. After 5 hours, it is no longer really perceptible, but that should cover a fruitful year of sins until the priest sends us home with forgiveness. Thus, the price of the beautiful bottle is a slap in the face, but I turn the other cheek. Love at Your Darkest is a stunning composition, but will be deemed unworthy for the general public due to its longevity and sillage. I love it nonetheless, because I am so kind."
Bloom Gocce di Fiori,05/26/2025,Martinique,M,9,,2,Not complicated,"Gocce di Fiori isn’t too complicated of a fragrance. Actually, it’s pretty darn similar to the original Gucci Bloom, while being a fresh and sheer version of the formulation.

The main difference in terms of the composition, is that the jasmine feels more prevalent here, and there is a honeysuckle note lightly floating around in the mix.

It’s like a stripped down version of Bloom, but one that will serve its purposes as a lighter wear for the spring and summer months.

Upon the first spray of Gocce di Fiori, I pick up a good deal of the jasmine, but blended with the honeysuckle and Rangoon creeper.

However, as it dries down this one becomes more of a jasmine and tuberose fragrance. I still pick up the other two notes, but they are just slight impressions of how they were during the opening act."
Gucci Museo - Forever Now,03/03/2014,Escada1970,F,18,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,8,Tradition obliges - forever,"It's quite annoying not to be able to get a sample of the scent worldwide; if I were cheeky, I would dismiss it as somewhat arrogant.

According to international reviews, I can expect a masculine vetiver scent during testing, not a Sycomore launch like Chanel, but I’ll let myself be surprised.

In the opening, there are traditional citrus notes, nothing piercing, rather soft and reserved - already here, the impression of being ultra-classic begins. A bit soapy and old-fashioned, we approach the next note, which is dominated by lavender. In my perception, I see scenarios of a Mediterranean landscape before me.
Morning mood, the lavender doesn't want to scent yet because there's too little sun, roses also refuse their flood of senses. So let's wait and see if this restrained morning mood wants to finally give way in the scent.
That restraint... this olfactory restrained morning mood runs through the scent, unfortunately! No note really wants to come forward, everything is so reserved that one is tempted to apply three times to get that hoped-for kick.

I bury myself in my left hand... where is the leather and where is my beloved iris? I can't find them. Already after 15 minutes, vetiver appears, very distinguished and noble. I can only imagine my iris and my leather... let me get my sketch pad :-(

Throughout, vetiver truly dominates, well done no question. Unfortunately, I know only better vetiver scents, and this one does not impress at all.

I find the concept of Gucci Museo a bit too boring. It’s probably just me; I expected a bit more design, Italian joie de vivre - Dolce Vita, but that’s not the case, and I’ll just take note of that.

The addition of Museo should have warned me... there are modern and classic ones, here we encounter an ultra-classic museum. The works are booked for 10 years, no deviation from the exhibition planned, fact!!

Longevity is very good; despite its reserved aura, the scent lasts over 7 hours. The sillage is not really strong and surely won’t negatively stand out to anyone.

Overall impression, short and sweet: too classically composed and completely lacking in statement and ambition. Tradition or not, more could have been made from the notes. This scent would have benefited from a few edges.
For an Italian classic scent, it lacks a variety of fougère notes, this overlay of herbs and fine hesperidic notes, this Cologne style.
So unfortunately, it’s a cool, morning walk in the garden that doesn’t go beyond the restraint.
If I want to wander nostalgically in the garden, then certainly with the best scent ever... Sous le Vent :-)"
Rush Summer,06/23/2013,Flavorite,F,241,,1,How About a Hawaiian Punch?,"This fruity fresh floral smells exactly like the bright red artificially flavored fruit punch 'Hawaiian Punch', somewhat similar to Red Fruit Punch Kool-Aid. It is not bad, in its ability to transport me back to the summer of 1977, the backyard, kids and lots of high fructose corn-syrup drinks in the sunshine. It is saved from being totally unwearable by the fact that it is quite sheer and not overly cloying. I couldn't detect the woodiness or level of muskiness that gave the original Rush its naughty reputation as a 'party girl scent'. This is a warm weather frozen white rum punch with juicy non-descript red berries projecting a fruity-tooty youthful splash, strictly for poolside parties and be prepared to be attacked by ants and bees, for sure. While I enjoyed the sniffing experience, I knew almost immediately that I, personally, didn't want to smell like a kid's beverage drink. I also suspect that there is something identical to this available for a fraction of the price in the Demeter Fragrance Library's Tropical Drink Scent section."
Rosa Incandescente,01/12/2024,Jayroyde,M,10,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Freshly Washed Sorcinelli,"Morning forest air. Fresh resinousness. Somewhere in the distance, a few wild roses are blooming. Before you, the last remnants of the campfire from the night before glow. You take a dip in the nearby forest lake. On the shore, you squeeze yourself some orange juice and garnish it with rosemary. You let your thoughts wander and watch the clouds drift by.

This might be my favorite Sorcinelli because it places the classic incense quality in a completely new context: There is nothing sacred or historically heavy anymore-a forest-fresh lightness surrounds everything and you simply feel good. For me, there is not a single disruptive note here. The musk even gives it a subtle creamy powderiness.

Fluffy, light, soft, soothing, yet still alluring-a Sorcinelli for every day. I am completely thrilled."
Guilty Stud Limited Edition,05/03/2025,Akira1005,F,221,,2,The swiftest chop. Anyone else would have missed it,"Yes, I like all notes of them.
Conclusion: They disappear quickly, so you can't love or hate them.
I'll explain it. It's like sucking delicious lemonade through a 10m straw. The limit of the straw is 10m, and you can definitely smell it, but after about 10 seconds, it smells like an hour has passed since the last scent disappeared. No matter how you look at it, I think this scent is too gentle. The scent is a nice white flower scent, but the scent fades quickly. It feels like sprinkling alcohol on concrete in the hot sun and it evaporates in an instant. I don't recommend it. Perfumes with natural fragrances are difficult. There is a jasmine scent similar to LUST from LUSH, but it may be the same scent because it is a natural fragrance."
Guilty Stud Limited Edition,07/11/2017,StellaDiverF,F,213,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Affordable sweet orange blossom twist of Mugler Alien,"The opening of Néroli & Petit Grain Printanier is all about sweet mandarine and orange blossom, and the deep, intense, bitter green petitgrain, which together make an intriguing pairing of indolic bittersweet. Surprisingly, about 20 minutes in, the fragrance starts to show a strong jasmine, which makes the whole smells distinctively similar to Mugler Alien layered over the caramelised mandarine undertone of orange blossom.

This Alien impression eventually fades after about 1 hour, and Neroli & Petit Grain Printanier returns to a fluffy orange blossom skin scent until the end. The sillage is moderate to soft, and the longevity is around 5 hours on my skin.

While neroli and petitgrain might lead one to expect a cologne type of fresh, transparent fragrances, Néroli & Petit Grain Printanier actually retains quite some of the natural indolic and sweet aspects of the orange blossom, but is still very approachable and nowhere near as being syrupy or cotton candy-like. I would recommend it as budget-friendly sweet orange blossom or an orange flower twist of Mugler Alien."
Guilty Stud Limited Edition,10/04/2018,Meggi,M,1018,,27,A Hint of Grown-Up-ness,"The orangey part comes across rather tame. This is not a summer fresh scent; rather, a creamy, white-flower, plant-green, tender aura soon emerges as the true focus, framed by a candy-like, zesty citrus note. As the name addition of the fragrance aptly suggests, it is less summery and more spring-like. The bushiness of the petit grains shows only in hints, yet still represents a charming touch.

I find this overall feminine, in a young-fresh-flirty and very charming way. The pungent aspect of jasmine is sufficient to distinguish the scent from actual skin cream and to emphasize a perfumed quality, but it is not overpowering.

The vanilla remains very subdued. Even by noon, the floral cream is finely tart, and up until the eighth hour, there is always a reliable hint of green present.

Conclusion: A cream scent in the best sense. Unobtrusive and providing a good natural fragrance feeling, yet not flimsy or arbitrary. Perhaps even suitable for girls of that age who are gradually taking their mothers' cosmetic choices seriously. The present candidate offers the possibility of gifting a chemical-free, subtle, and not least beautiful scent that still allows the young ones to feel a certain hint of grown-up-ness.

Everyone else will simply feel comfortable with it.

I thank Bellemorte for the sample."
Guilty Stud Limited Edition,03/28/2018,Naimie54,M,115,HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Fruity and Spring-like,"Neroli & Petit Grain Printanier is a fragrance that starts off very fresh with a light green undertone.

Neroli quickly becomes very prominent and is supported by a woody note. It truly smells like freshly crushed stems.

A few minutes later, the scent turns fruity, with the fruitiness being very concentrated and intense. The neroli scent has nearly disappeared.

After about an hour, Neroli & Petit Grain Printanier reaches the conclusion of its development with a citrus note.

Neroli & Petit Grain Printanier is a lovely spring fragrance that fortunately has nothing to do with 4711 Echt Kölnisch Wasser. It feels very natural. The sillage is good at first but quickly draws back to body closeness. The longevity is very good for a natural fragrance, lasting seven hours."
