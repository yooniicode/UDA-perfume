Narcisse,06/22/2023,DogiCoco,F,637,,2,Rhubarb-blackberry lemonade in the green grass,"A delightful fruity green. Even though it's not listed in the notes, this smells so much of rhubarb. The blackberry is also noticeable, but rhubarb even more so. Both are fresh and tart and only slightly sweetened. The fruitiness feels sparkling and almost thirst-quenching. Imagine drinking a homemade berry lemonade on a meadow in the woods and you're close to Herbae. Despite the name, the greenness in this doesn't feel too herbal, it's rather leafy and a little grassy. I'm not sure what nettles really smell like, I'm afraid to sniff them, so I can't say if that note is really there... But I can say that this is a beautiful summer scent with a slight hint of creamy sweetness in the base.

If you want to compare it to other popular fruity scents, this is not as ethereal and sophisticated as a Hermes, but not as sugary as an Escada. It's just uplifting and summery. Strong like, maybe bordering on a love."
Narcisse,10/18/2024,Mikuru,F,10,,1,"Sour and light, too sour and too light","Very light and with nonexistent projection, it immediately presents its green notes ,the a certain kind of sourness and acidity that is definitely fresh, almost citrusy, perhaps given by the nettle (almost similar to a lime). My throat certainly felt like I swallowed a slice of lime. Towards the end it warms up and ironically lets out some ambrette (presumably in the top, I did have to wait twenty minutes or so to perceive it). Sweet fruit undetectable by my nose."
Narcisse,06/07/2022,Blondefcb123,F,8,,23,The Garden of My Grandparents,"Grandpa was always my childhood hero.
We visited my grandparents very often, and he had a beautiful large garden.
In the summer, the flowers bloomed, the lawn smelled fresh after mowing, and the herbs released a wonderful scent. I often stayed in the garden for hours until the sun went down.
Years passed, and unfortunately, Grandma became seriously ill and had to be placed in a nursing home. Grandpa was still fit, so I went shopping with him to distract him. We browsed at L'Occitane, and I sprayed Herbae. Grandpa looked at me: It smells like our garden! You have to buy this scent!
Said and done. I bought this wonderful fragrance. Every time I visited Grandpa, I wore it, and he always got a spritz of it too.
The scent is simply wonderful to me, smelling of herbs, sunshine, and flowers. It smells like Provence on a spring day. The sweet grass comes through beautifully, and the fruits are a must. I even think I perceive raspberries every time.
Time went by, and Grandpa also became a nursing case. During my visits to the nursing home, I sprayed the fragrance, and we reminisced about old times.
Grandpa reached a beautiful age and passed away.
I often think back to our wonderful time together.
Recently, I visited my dear grandparents again at the cemetery. A warm summer breeze blew through my dress-there it was again, Grandpa's garden.
Grandpa is just somewhere else, still present for me. He will always remain in my heart.
How I wish I could be carefree in the garden again, enjoying the summer.
But no one can take my memories away from me, nor the scent.
This fragrance touches me deeply, even though it is actually not my usual scent profile.
If you're looking for a beautiful summer fragrance, you are in the right place here.
Anyone dreaming of summer in Provence, perhaps in a convertible :-) will not be disappointed.
It's great that it is still available to buy at L'Occitane."
Narcisse,06/29/2021,Gingeralena,F,40,HELPFUL REVIEW,8,"If it's not in there, what's on the label","With a name like Herbae, I think of something herbal, very green without much else. All of this is not ""Herbae | L'Occitane en Provence.""
The opening is very fruity; I can already perceive the blackberry alongside the listed bergamot. But not just the fruits, rather the whole bush including the leaves. This makes the scent not sweet, but rather lightly green - fitting for the color of the bottle.
I can also sniff out the sage, which complements the slightly green character very well.
The wild rose takes a back seat.
Sweet grass also joins in, while the musk fluff can only be detected if you sniff very closely.
The scent remains soft, light, and pleasant; it will never be off-putting. It doesn't stand out significantly either (especially since the sillage is quite restrained), but sometimes you don't want that at all, rather just a scent for feeling good.
And that is absolutely ""Herbae | L'Occitane en Provence"" for me.
A lovely everyday companion for the office or leisure time; for a big evening appearance, something more substantial would be in order."
Narcisse,04/17/2025,flordelune,F,1,,3,Spring Air,"Smells to me like riding a bike, freshly showered, with my hair down. Sun on my skin, a breeze of fresh wind, and orange lemonade. Buds are blooming, birds are chirping, and in the air, there’s a sense of a new beginning.

I don’t know how L‘Occitane managed to bottle this scent… I wish the world would smell like this in spring."
Chloé Rose Tangerine,11/10/2025,taroscented,F,39,,0,thin but cozy,"It's a lighter version of By the Fireplace with a bit of Velvet Haze, a softer and fluffier interpretation, clearing the smoke. I smell cloves, but that isn't listed in the notes, probably to distance itself from By the Fireplace.

I have some friends anosmic to Commodity Paper- (iso e super?) and those same friends can't smell this at all either.

I really love this. I have BtF, but sometimes I don't want to smell like smoke, but I do want to smell like chestnut and cacao and spices. I just wish it was a tiny bit stronger and more long lasting!"
"Love, Chloé Eau Florale",05/21/2025,Smirky,M,483,,4,Fruit and more fruit,"Goat opens with a very fruity scent which I attribute to the osmanthus. There is also a sweet milky effect under the fruit. If you've ever had goat milk, it's quite tart; the sweet milk did not bring a goat to mind but more like cow's milk with sugar. The fruity scent hung around for quite some time and gradually morphing to bring in something similar but dryer - probably the cloves and oud. Yes, there was something animalic hiding in the background - what the cumin, leather, costus, fur? - but it was pretty mild. I just couldn't shake the fruity accord and the animalic accord seemed pretty mild. Overall disappointing.

Longevity for me was quite good - got about 10 hours out of Goat. I'm surprised to see the generally lower longevity rating. Projection was moderate."
"Love, Chloé Eau Florale",04/12/2025,Enginqueer,M,8,,1,An ode to the wild hillside.,"This is the most untamed frag ive tried, I've intentionally avoided animalics because its not a profile that appeals to me but was interested enough in the brand and want to keep an open mind.

Goat is so unapologetic that I have to respect it. Although unpleasant, this does not come off as edgy or for the purpose of shock value. It is just faithfully encapsulating the essence of what a goat calls home. As if we (humans) are not the target audience for this fragrance, so that's why I find it off-putting.

True to the name, this smells like a goat. I expected it to be inspired by a goat but this goes all in at the opening. It smells like fur and the mushroom/truffle and milk accord really remind me of sheep droppings, with its earthy and sour lactonic quality.

As it dries, it mellows out, gets a little less dirty and gets a bit more cozy? It reminds me of hiking with the image of the mountain streams as the sun beating down. It's thick and humid, there are green wild florals underneath the leathery notes but they are faint.
The path you walk is not an established trail, like you'd find when going to a national park, it's wild and you are in the goats territory. This smells like their domain and you are merely visiting.

To conclude I think this is fascinating, I love how vividly this makes me think of the wild hillsides and mountains.
A scent for goats, as much as one inspired by them."
"Love, Chloé Eau Florale",01/13/2023,Violett,F,63,,25,Keen on Goat,"I was really looking forward to this bottle. It brought me just as much joy during testing as watching its cheeky, greedy namesakes.
However, ""Goat"" has much more in common with goats and kids than just its name. Certainly not their typical stable and pen smell.
And that's a good thing.

Because the odor wafting around those little horned creatures in petting zoos and the like smells quite strongly of their excretions. To put it bluntly: Where kids frolic in close quarters, it stinks.
Thus, the common billy goat understandably has a certain image problem among fragrance lovers right from the start. Sex sells, as they say. Perhaps ""Goat"" would be a bit more popular if it were named something like ""Dirty Love""?
When it comes to animal scents, I'm theoretically open to a lot, but tend to be a bit of a softie. For example, I had to pass on the coarse animalic notes of the often-hyped yet polarizing ""The Lover's Tale | Francesca Bianchi."" My stomach rebelled so much right after spraying that I had to wash it off with a lot of soap. After that, at least a decent leather scent remained. In ""The Lover's Tale | Francesca Bianchi,"" olfactorily, everything the stable has to offer is initially present. Even the cheese factory next door gets to tell the nose all about the aging process of an Appenzeller.
Then there are those perfumes where you get ""powdered animal"" served. Something like:
Customer: ""I would like a portion of dirty sweat stinker, extra hot, rrrrroooaaaaarrrr.""
Perfumer: ""Certainly. Would you like one of the really bad ones?""
Customer: ""No, no, I'd prefer one of the sweet ones with the powder coating (in a bunny costume)...""
Such olfactory experiences remind me of the good old days at the French royal court when washing was frowned upon. People, just like their wigs, in which generations of fleas probably found a home, where lice dynasties thrived, solved various hygiene and stench problems in rather questionable ways with layer upon layer of powder.
I'll skip the examples for now. But honestly: I'd rather have the Bianchi.
Now to Goat, which belongs neither to the ""hardcore animal faction"" nor to the ""powder stinkers.""
To my nose, it's a harmless little fellow, just as it should be.
Most would probably not even guess in a blind test that Goat is supposed to smell like a goat...
Because there is no olfactory photorealism here; instead, you get a funny, colorful Picasso goat presented to your nose. It comes rumbling along on a (odorless) wheeled contraption, kicking up quite a bit of dark dust. The scent of dark (patch soil) with a similarly dark, slightly smoky leather note first wafts into my nose. Look at that, the little billy goat is wearing a biker jacket. And it has brought something along:
The scent of violet and osmanthus combines for me into a tipsy blackberry-peach-apricot mixture. So, so: Three different liqueurs in tow...
That's beautifully refined and fits well together.
At this point, fans of hardcore animal scents are already out - way too sweet with the fruity stuff...
The sweetness increases as the scent develops, and I must say: A tad less would have been more here. The background brightens up, and the dark dust gradually settles to the ground. In the background, you can now smell a warm, golden-brown mélange of hay, light earthy tones, wood, a bit of oud sharpness, and spices. And there's also a slight scent of fur or wool detectable. The listed mushrooms? I can only say that if they're there, they are keeping a low profile. Perhaps a few small champignons or chanterelles behind the haystack. The cheese mentioned by some, I absolutely cannot perceive. And that's saying something, as my nose usually loves to focus on edibles... Well, cheese is a scent impression that I generally don't miss in perfume.
Ultimately, Goat goes through the frequently sniffed scent development. It becomes sweeter, softer. In the end, only a bit of fruit and warmth remains.
The ""family test"" was positive. My husband says ""Good,"" which for a Palatinate person is almost ecstasy! My daughter loves the furry creature as well but thinks it smells like a riding school.
(They surprise me time and again... They won't let me pass on the ""Bottega Veneta (Eau de Parfum) | Bottega Veneta,"" those niche snobs)
The Polish brand ""Wolf Brothers"" is fun to test. Each fragrance is dedicated to an animal, and the creative visions of the makers have been implemented by professional perfumers from Grasse. You can smell that too. They are all well-made, original - and yet wearable.
Well, what can I say? It could probably be fun for not just me to have a professional perfumer realize one or another scent vision.... You don't treat yourself to anything else...
...Except of course for one or another funny niche fragrance! Here’s another thank you to the wonderfully quirky participants of my sharing. I hope you have as much fun with the little billy goat as I do."
Chloé,10/25/2024,ALCHABNO78,M,32,,1,fresh and sophisticated,"Massimo by Christian Provenzano is a sophisticated and captivating fragrance that embodies the essence of elegance and refinement. It opens with fresh, invigorating citrus notes, which gradually give way to a heart of aromatic spices and herbs, creating a warm and inviting scent profile. The base notes are rich and complex, featuring deep woody accords and subtle hints of leather, giving the fragrance a masculine and timeless appeal. Massimo is perfect for those who appreciate a well-balanced scent that exudes confidence and charm, suitable for both day and evening wear."
Chloé,09/14/2025,Fabian100,M,6,,1,This fragrance brings compliments!,"I have rarely received more compliments for a fragrance. Perhaps it’s precisely because it is different. The scent notes are all very natural and subtle, yet the overall composition is very intentional and strong in presence. To me, it smells like a spa day, sauna infusion, and a winding down of the day. I consider it one of the fragrances for late summer and autumn."
Chloé,12/18/2024,Fabianwzl,M,2,,0,Pepper that you won't smell in the kitchen,"Well, I guess it's time for my first review :)

Let's go through it chronologically and start with the packaging.
Here, one has to ask the question, what more could be improved?
Starting from the packaging to the embedding of the bottle and the cap of the sprayer.

The only allowed complaint at a high level would be that Massimo doesn't offer a real difference compared to other fragrances from the brand Christian Provenzano.
Alright, now to the most important part:

At the beginning, the bergamot makes its presence known, but in my opinion, the pepper is definitely in the spotlight here. Both at the opening and during the drydown.
I'm not entirely sure about the H/S.
On clothes and with close ""sniffing,"" the scent is definitely noticeable all day, but for someone who wants to draw the attention of the entire room, it's definitely the wrong choice.

Personally, I prefer to wear the fragrance in combination with a clothing style of at least business casual.
In general, it's definitely a great office scent that you can hardly go wrong with and still smells unique.
Oh yes, price/performance...

Fortunately, I was able to secure Massimo with a 20% discount on Black Friday, but if we consider the regular price of 289,- for 100ml, that's quite a statement.

Definitely not a blind buy."
Nomade,05/05/2018,pudelbonzo,F,2405,,19,Stable Scent,"My husband insists that one never really gets rid of their ""stable scent.""

He means this in a social sense - and he may be right.
My mother put it more bluntly: You can't turn a chamber pot into a soup pot.

I enjoy carrying the stable scent with me in two ways.
On one hand, the aforementioned imprint, and on the other hand, the familiar scent of the horse stable that always accompanied me.

That soothing scent, when my husband started the clattering oat mill, was a delight for me.
The stables were permeated with the scent of oats, rounded off by the note of hay.
And the horses stretched their necks in anticipation of their meal.
And then afterwards their satisfied munching.

I also loved wandering through our oat fields, where the blue blossoms of cornflowers stood out.
The good soil exuded earthiness - and in the air lingered the nutty scent of hazel bushes.
A piece of home.

Oat & Cornflower is a natural, nature-connected fragrance that not only reminds one of the English fields but also of the fields and meadows in the beautiful Sauerland.

Why wander far away - see, the good lies so close."
Nomade,05/15/2018,loewenherz,M,916,,18,Casual Delicious Breakfast Flaky,"The underlying principle of Jo Malone's English Fields series is actually quite clearly anchored in its name: English fields. So, a green or at least botanical theme: each featuring a flower and mostly - in four out of five cases: wheat, barley, rye, and here indeed oats - a type of grain. This heralds summery scents - like a cheerful country outing through English hill landscapes with a well-filled picnic basket.

Green Wheat & Meadowsweet, the first (and most beautiful) of the five limited edition scents I have commented on, still fulfills this expectation: a quietly cheerful summer fragrance full of wonderfully fresh June greens - uncomplicated, effortless. Honey & Crocus, which I described a few days ago, already diverges - as a scent of warm, buttered honey rolls, while still allowing its botanical name part - the crocus - to be recognized.

With Oat & Cornflower, there is hardly anything to be found of its floral component - the cornflower. Instead, there is much more of its (processed) grainy aspect. Oat & Cornflower is the scent of breakfast flakes, leaning more towards Frosties or Smacks in terms of sweetness than Toppas. It also reminds one of oatmeal cookies - the American version, the size of beer coasters and still soft on the inside. Or of warm cake. Butter cookies. Its medium strength is quite suitable for summer.

Conclusion: this cookie note is a bit one-dimensional. Where, for example, Serge Lutens' Jeux de Peau, which many also call a cookie scent, adds a noticeably organic, almost animalistic component that makes it interesting and experienceable beyond the grainy sweetness, Oat & Cornflower exclusively focuses on cereals (which sometimes have more calories than chocolate). For lovers of gourmands, it is a feast for the senses. But there is hardly a trace of English fields."
Nomade,03/11/2018,DonJuanDeCat,M,2046,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,9,A Scent Like a Spread,"And here we go again with the new Jo Malone fragrances. The English Fields scents are fragrances that include, among other things, grain notes. But don't worry, anyone thinking that you might smell like bread with these is mistaken :D

Although the grain notes in the fragrances are certainly noticeable (even if not particularly strong), they do not smell like bread or porridge or anything else you typically make from grains (... yes,... beer is also made from various grains, you thought of that immediately, didn't you?... :D). The fragrances are, of course, more perfumey, but the grain gives them a special, unusual note.

I find that all five of the fragrances are quite lovely and should at least be checked out once. Now comes Oat & Cornflower, one of the slightly heavier and creamier scents from this line.

The Scent:
I don't know how cornflowers smell, but the scent starts off quite creamy, sweet, and floral for me. Then it becomes a bit nutty; I find the hazelnut is quite noticeable and reminds me, especially together with the sweet, creamy notes, of chocolate spreads like Nutella, well, at least a little.
The creaminess remains, and you can perceive a bit of oat, although not very strongly, and the scent generally smells good, but also a bit heavy, at least for a summer fragrance; it might come off as a bit intense for some.
In the base, the scent remains creamy and sweet with what I perceive as indeterminate floral notes. You can still smell the hazelnuts for a while before they fade away. I'm a bit unsure about the vetiver; it seems to be very weak, although some could detect this note better than I could, which means that vetiver is likely quite noticeable. And as Zitrönchen mentioned in her comment, there’s also a feeling that a light coconut note might appear.
I think Oat & Cornflower is a successful scent as well.

The Sillage and Longevity:
The sillage is really good; you leave a nice, larger scent cloud and are therefore quite noticeable.
The longevity is even extremely good. Sprayed on just before evening, around 5 PM, I could still smell the scent well on my skin the next morning after lunch.

The Bottle:
The rectangular bottle is slender and tall. It has a pale blue pastel look and looks nice. A special feature is the lower third of the bottle, which is rocky. Or rather, it has a rocky, grainy ""wallpaper"" that looks good and feels nice. A very beautiful bottle.

Yes, I also really liked this scent from the English Fields line, but unfortunately, I find it a bit too feminine for me to wear as a man. Most of the scents in this line (unfortunately) come off as a bit too feminine, but for you ladies, they represent successful fragrances that you should check out.

Oat & Cornflower has turned out creamy and sweet, smelling of oat and hazelnut, and initially, especially because of the hazelnut, it even seems a bit like a nutty-chocolate spread, so it really smells delicious, even if it comes off a bit heavier than the other fragrances. Of course, I would advise against using it as a Nutella substitute, even if your Nutella is all gone and you really want to snack on such a spread. Because no matter how delicious a scent smells, it never tastes like it smells, um... I'm not speaking from experience here... :D
But you probably know that; on the other hand, I also know that you are all crazy addicts, capable of anything, so you never know,... :DD

The scent is wearable in spring, but you might want to be careful not to over-apply, as it can come off as heavier, especially since it lasts quite a long time. By the way, this makes it very suitable for going out.

So, as I said, check out this scent when you have the chance; maybe you'll like it too!"
Nomade,03/05/2018,Zitrönchen,F,12,HELPFUL REVIEW,5,From Picking Flowers to Baking Cookies,"First of all, I like them all, the new and limited Jo Malones from the English Fields collection, but this one unfortunately comes in last for me. This may be mainly because it is incredibly intense for a Jo Malone fragrance.

The Bottle
Typical for Jo Malone fragrances in a limited edition, all English Fields scents come in the classic Jo Malone design with a twist. This time, the glass of the bottle is painted in pastel colors and glazed in a structured and contrasting color in the lower third. This creates a texture reminiscent of stone and porcelain, as if Jo Malone had teamed up with Villeroy & Boch. It is elegant and chic and fits wonderfully in the hand. The cap is made of plastic this time and is in the same color as the upper two-thirds of the bottle. The caps fit a bit tighter than usual, so the fragrance usually opens with a satisfying ""pop"" sound. As beautiful as the bottles are, they do have a drawback and an advantage at the same time. On one hand, the fragrance is somewhat protected from light, but even when held against a light source, the fill level can only be guessed. Furthermore, the transition of colors is not cleanly executed on all bottles, and some have a slight color shadow in the transition. Those who care about this should take a close look at the bottles before purchasing.

The Fragrance
Wow, this is a strong little potion for an EdC. At first, a rather heavy and floral note hits you with a slightly powdery undertone. This is apparently the cornflower, though I don’t remember its scent being so heavy and overwhelming. It’s almost as if you’ve just picked a large bouquet of flowers and are now burying your nose right in, and then the fragrance takes its time. It takes a relatively long time for the development to begin, as if you’ve leisurely set off on your walk home with the bouquet. Once there, freshly baked cookies are cooling on a plate and filling the house with their scent. Because after some time has passed, oats and hazelnut finally emerge, providing a creamy cookie scent. Nevertheless, the cornflower remains very present for a long time, vying for attention. The vetiver is only subtly noticeable, as if it doesn’t want to be noticed, but this also keeps the fragrance from going completely off the rails and becoming too sweet. In the end, a creamy, slightly sweet scent emerges, as if coconut or vanilla were included. Even after 8 hours, I can still clearly perceive the fragrance on myself.

Conclusion
This fragrance is something for cooler spring days when you long for the blooming of flowers, or for autumn when you’re not quite ready to let go of summer. It is surprisingly intense and long-lasting, and one should already enjoy heavier fragrances, as it clearly leans towards the gourmand direction. Those who like light scents like Wild Bluebell are in the wrong place here. However, those looking for a spring-like and lighter alternative to Black Opium with a cookie note that you don’t smell on every corner might find joy in this fragrance."
Nomade,01/19/2024,Arrosa,F,48,,9,Incredible...,"... beautiful!

I am happy and sad at the same time, because with Oat & Cornflower I have found my new great love and my signature scent. It could be so wonderful if the fragrance weren't a limited edition from 2018.

Now, let's talk about the scent:
Cornflower or anything floral is not really perceivable here. Rather, the composition of hazelnut and oat is more distinguishable.
While there is indeed a slight green note in the fragrance, it is fundamentally warm, soft, perhaps even a little lactonic and vanillic.

For me, it is a feel-good scent. One that hugs me. One that makes me feel alive. And one that reminds me of nature and the beauty of life.

And yes, when broken down, one could say it also evokes thoughts of a nut porridge. It is definitely a gourmand, although not a classic one. So there’s no need to worry about smelling like oatmeal :)"
Love Story Eau Sensuelle,05/17/2025,Cawdor,M,22,,1,"Dry, fuity incense","Fruity, primarily raspberry, incense blast that fades to an amber-sandalwood-slightly earthy, slightly medicinal finish.

Interestingly, for a perfume that features fruit notes, there's no cloying sweetness here, and it's dry as a bone. This astringency is the core characteristic of the perfume. Incense is very prominent in the opening but turns more subtle during the drydown, emerging in wafts throughout the day.

I wasn't hugely impressed the first time I wore this, but it has grown on me, primarily because it is so spare, so aloof, and even though the constituent notes are far from unique, the way they are presented gives this a distinct character of its own.

This doesn't suggest anything cosmic to me, or actually conjure up any immediate mental images or emotional associations. It's a pretty cerebral creation, and I like this a lot more than I initially thought. Long lasting, intermittently powerful, worth investigating."
Magnolia Alba,05/17/2024,Catchmynose,M,67,,3,The Gummy Bear Alternative,"Touché… The name evokes a nasty pressure in my stomach. Is it something about the scent? No!! I wasn’t outsmarted during fencing or a discussion, and I’m not sitting here - after a direct hit (Touché) - sulking in the corner.
What makes me feel queasy is the thought of a boy band of the same name that wreaked havoc in the early 2000s. Not only did the ""pop titan"" himself produce this musical disaster… but these ""musicians"" are more aptly described as a ""quirk of nature."" Just take a look at the pictures on Google…. or listen to one of their ""songs.""
Due to this association, I obviously don’t agree with the naming. Whether the people at LPDO have ever heard of this group is questionable. However, what this group definitely would have known is a little fragrance from Tiziana Terenzi.
Kirkè EXTRAIT DE PARFUM surely served as a godparent for this creation. But that doesn’t make the scent any worse…. and some even claim that TOUCHÉ is the better Kirke; but I won’t go that far…
The opening is sweet-fruity. A colorful tropical cocktail with all sorts of goodies from the fruit department. I can perceive berries and peach… the rest of the ingredients, however, vanish in a fragrant cloud of sugary vacation vibes. Touché is not a freshie, as it performs too sticky for me. Already in the top note, I notice the biggest difference from Kirke, which continues to linger for a long 8 hours until the finale. Most call it ""synthetic""… I call it ""positively piercing."" OK… Kirke already experiences something like ""hate"" and is often labeled as ""chemical club"" or ""hairspray scent."" Now I could say: ""Just look up the word synthetic on Wikipedia… then you’ll find something about 'Touché' too""… but I won’t say that…. And why not? Because I like ""the thing."" Do you know those plastic twist-and-drink bottles? As a child, I loved that stuff. On every school trip or even on a trip to Hagenbeck, those sugary fruit juices with a delightful formaldehyde aftertaste were always there! And that’s exactly what TOUCHE reminds me of; and that’s POSITIVE! The sillage is also good and gives the surroundings the childish impression of a visit to the Bäderland-Hamburg. I don’t feel this connection with Kirke.
Price: Here the equation applies: 10x Touché = 1x Kirke; and you can certainly notice the extreme price difference as the TT hit feels softer and more mature (WHAT!!!! …the Kirke bashers will now exclaim… “That’s just not possible”).
Conclusion: An inexpensive alternative from Italy with a gummy bear flair. Not for everyone… Still: I LIKE!"
Nuit d'Oranger,06/05/2017,Serafina,F,479,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Speculoos or Caramel Cookie?,"So what is it? This perfume has elements of both, yet it is not a typical gourmand that makes you smell like you've spent the last hours baking cookies in the kitchen (although I do enjoy such scents!). Other notes still play a significant role, flowers that I cannot identify as individual notes, and base notes that transform “Star of the Season Elixir” into a spicy-warm, sweet, yet simultaneously elegant perfume.
I completely agree with Angua that the pyramid of “Star of the Seasons” fits better, and the one for the Elixir apparently only shows the additional notes. My “fear opponent” cumin fortunately only makes a brief appearance and in a rather friendly manner. It has ruined many beautiful scents for me in the past, as it usually comes off as sweaty on my skin - thankfully not here.
Even with the small sample, I immediately fell in love with this scent. And by chance, there was also a current sharing going on. However, the decant will only be used during the pre-Christmas season - ultimately, it is indeed a perfume that I find extremely suitable for this time of year due to the spices and sweetness."
Orchidée de Minuit,06/08/2015,Caliope,F,28,HELPFUL REVIEW,3,oh no...,"...it's not that bad after all! This scent has a distinctly berry-like quality to it, reminiscent of Armani's City Glam, somewhat herbal and perhaps a bit of an acquired taste for some noses. In the case of Sex and the City, however, there’s also a gourmand touch of caramel that starts off sugary and then spreads deliciously and slightly creamy, especially in the base. And a dose of almost overripe oranges/tangerines. I have nothing against herbal notes and I prefer the berry aspect much more than the orange one, but the combination of both isn’t really my thing, especially when both elements are so strongly present. I can't perceive ambroxan, and the woods could definitely stand out more for my taste, which would give the scent more edges and character. As it is, it remains quite agreeable.
Sex and the City is not a milestone in the art of perfumery, but it can easily compete with all the Katzenbergers, Playboys, Essences, and whatever else is available in the drugstore, and it makes for a nice companion on moderately warm days."
Orchidée de Minuit,09/09/2014,NadsSpatz,F,596,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,2,Sour-Fruity instead of Sensual-Sexy,"~ Inspiration ~
I received the perfume in a swap. I know the series ""Sex and the City,"" but I was previously unaware of the perfume.

~ Bottle ~
The square shape with rounded edges is in transparent khaki. The name is printed in gold lettering on the front.

~ Scent ~
Sour-fruity.
Upon spraying, it is initially quite zesty with blood oranges, mandarins, passion fruit, and berries. After a few minutes, floral accords emerge in the form of gardenias, orange blossoms, and jasmine. With sandalwood, musk, amber, and a gentle caramel note, it finishes somewhat warm and woody.

~ Longevity ~
Unfortunately, it only lasts about 2-3 hours on my skin (a bit longer on clothing and hair). You can confidently spray it on.

~ Occasion ~
A 0815 everyday scent that can be worn anytime and anywhere.

~ Conclusion ~
Not so bad at all - I just expected a different scent direction based on the name. Additionally, it is a bit too synthetic and sour for me."
Orchidée de Minuit,08/04/2014,Seerose,F,775,,0,Slow-Motion Quickie,"If anyone expects me to elaborate on the topic of sex: no way! I certainly won’t reveal anything about myself! I will never do that, even with the most sensual fragrances.
This scent is conveniently found in the ""Sample on Tour"" travel package, and I randomly fished it out of the collection because the label was so faint that I had to use a magnifying glass and LED light to decipher the name. So I quickly applied it, called it up, and before the scent evaporates again, I’ll describe it quickly.
""Sex sells"" - that is the unmistakable intention behind this perfume name.
Because such an inexpensive little bottle can be afforded by any teenager, allowing them to gain recognition in their peer group, and perhaps provoke a few prudish adults.
But otherwise, this is a perfectly normal boring cheap scent. Harmless!
""SatC"" starts fruity, but not too sweet, quite zesty. Not even with a ""red berry note"" does it provoke me.
Flowers, if they are even perceptible, are muddled by synthetic sandalwood. Unfortunately, there are no animalistic, carrion-like O-flowers or even jasmine clusters that evoke any associations or feelings of desire, of any kind, e.g., the desire to get worked up over such stinky odors. Not happening! No chance.
Gardenia? Pah! You have to knit that yourself if you want to have at least a visual idea of it - or something like that.
For a little while, ""SatC"" is somewhat sharp and spicy, but before it could become interesting, it has already evaporated again. Ambroxan, which contributes to the longevity of fragrances, is already present, though not too strong. There are also fleeting moments with delicious caramel notes. It disappears faster than I can type. And I can type quickly.
Then, in the imagined dull wide city escapes, there remains a stale smell of relatively sour synthetic gummy candy, which, thanks to Ambroxan, will hardly be removable in the shower, according to my experience.
And with that, everything has been said about ""Sex and the City."""
Cedrus Intense,06/21/2015,Sorceress,F,216,,1,"Sweetly Floral, Perfectly Mixed Fruit","This is a well-mixed blend of jammy fruits that are richly blended to give a vintage feel to a perfume that's really not that old. If you didn't know the name or year of this perfume you would swear you were smelling a vintage perfume from decades ago. It's full-bodied, thick and lays on a bed of deep woods.
It's a sticky floral, almost narcotic with its sweetness. Decadence is sensual, old-school and more sophisticated than one would expect for its price. Some might call this a stuffy type of perfume, and that's ok. It's just not their style. It's not for everyone. That's what makes perfumes fun for all of us.
Decadence is long-lasting and strong, better-suited for nights. If you're looking for a strong perfume that brings you back to vintages, this might be one that's affordable. It's like walking down a lush garden path, inhaling every bouquet you can, with an outdoor kitchen not far away.
My bottle and box are marked ""Parfums International"" and look like the Prince Matchabelli bottle, so I'm actually not sure which one I own. I can post my review in both sections until someone can advise."
Cedrus Intense,04/10/2017,Minigolf,F,2512,,4,Dreamy Chypre by Matchabelli - Art,"I already know two fragrances from the ""Scent Prince"" (and I have them too):
""Wind Song"", a spicy-floral carnation scent, and...
""Cachet"", a thick, heavy 80s oakmoss Chypre ""board"".
And now a third, wonderful fragrance:
""Decadence"", also an 80s Chypre, but one of the spicy-floral kind.
With great longevity and equally impressive sillage.
The scent starts off quite harmlessly with citrus, peach, and a bit of ""leaf green"". Just as if it couldn't ""cloud the waters"" and drifts along completely insignificantly.
BUT THAT IS DECEPTIVE!!!
The little rascal (I have a mini) soon unexpectedly lets a floral garden bloom that truly has depth.
Garden carnations, very spicy, mingle with lily of the valley, where leaves and stems have been included in the distillation.
Roses, still armed with thorns on their branches, battle with ylang-ylang and jasmine for dominance, while iris, dark purple, sprinkles its powder over the squabblers and calls for harmony.
Which eventually does come....
Only much later in the foreground, but long before already latent and subtly present:
Woods, ""earth"", and moss. The ""foundation"" that makes a Chypre. Wonderful sandalwood contributes its own unique touch. Sweet and bitter at the same time, it could be a standalone perfume and enhances the EdP even further.
It's a shame that this ""prince's jewel"" is now almost impossible to find.
Quite different from ""Cachet"" and ""Wind Song"", but with the typical ""Matchabelli"" signature.
WUUUNNNSCHLIIISTEEEE!!!!"
Immortelle,03/24/2024,Gourmandgrl,F,307,,3,Somehow captures real rain,"So this does smell a LOT like ""pre-storm"": thick in the air, right before it rains, those first drops on the pavement before it pours.

But it also smells like a very aquatic men's cologne that I'd smelled before, and finally put my finger on: Polo Black EAU DE TOILETTE . It's nowhere near as masculine or musky - this a lighter aquatic, more unisex... but it's similar.

It smells quite fresh, maybe has the slightest hint of a cucumber melon in it. Disappears quickly, but what do you expect for the price/with it being Demeter? Overall, enjoyable novelty - it's the closest perfume I've found that mirrors actual rain."
Immortelle,06/14/2025,JumNum,N/A,7,,1,Garden scent,This fragrance smells like wet garden earth after a rainy day. It reminds me of the way i smell after planting new pants. After it dries i get a bit of a deodorant smell but it is always still pleasant to smell. I put this on when i do yoga to feel like im outside or on a rainy day where i want to feel more connected to nature.
Immortelle,01/03/2019,StellaDiverF,F,213,,2,Synthetic Petrichor,"The initial blast of Thunderstorm is a strong ozone scent. Though it has a shadow of the smell before a thunderstorm, it's actually too strong to be realistic at the beginning. The scent then gradually mellows into a mixture of green grass with drops and dirts, muds dipping in water, as if the rain has already finished. This aroma of after-rain slowly fades away during about the 5-hour wear. Althought it's not a conventional perfume, I find it pretty wearable and refreshing for a hot summer day. A very interesting olfactory experience to try."
Immortelle,02/09/2024,Eliasebm,M,1,,1,Almost threw up,"This might sound like an exaggeration but I almost puked when I smelled it. Even a family member gagged. It literally smells like mold. I just hoped it would smell like wet concrete or like a rainy summer day. Total waste of money, what a disappointment.Well, probably gonna throw it out or prank someone with it.

Now I'm just trying to fill out the review since it has to be 300 characters.."
Immortelle,01/22/2025,bbeeaann,N/A,5,,1,Floral Rain?,"I may be the odd one out in saying this fragrance is a bit too floral/powdery to remind me of a thunderstorm. I was expecting more ozonic and petrichor notes, but got something that opens sweet with a hint of earth. It is much more ""thunderstorm-y"" on the dry down, but the light floral notes never really go away.

I don't think this fragrance works well with my skin chemistry as I end up with a scent that smells more like a bouquet left out in the rain. Not bad to layer with but not long-lasting enough to get anything interesting out of.

Could potentially brighten darker-smelling earth scents!"
Immortelle,09/20/2015,Mamski,F,12,,15,Dead Flowerwater,"The small bottles of the Demeter Fragrance Library are lined up in three rows with their backs to me, and I boldly pull one out and dab it on my wrist. I want to do a blind test and find out if I can match the scents to their names. A murky, dark green cloud of scent wafts into my nose, and I don't yet know what to associate the smell with, but it feels familiar. It smells..."
Immortelle,02/27/2017,Franciska,F,46,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,3,Nettles in the Earth,"Ages ago, I had the opportunity to test the Demeter fragrances, but back then I didn't manage to write comments on all of them. Now that I've come across my unpublished notes or started comments, I don't want to withhold this from you.

Thunderstorm is one of the scents that I can imagine less. Therefore, I was all the more curious about how the storm smells. Generously applied to my arm and ""hmm... is this supposed to be stormy?"" If I hadn't known which of the Demeters I was testing, I would have thought this must be Beetroot. The scent has a somewhat green-bitter quality to it, and over time it reminds me a bit of nettles. The longer I smell it, a damp earthy note emerges that leaves a moist impression. Perhaps this is meant to represent a (nettle) patch after the rain/storm. Over time, the scent changes very little, only becoming a bit more subdued. Overall, I have the feeling that ""Thunderstorm"" is one of the lighter fragrances from Demeter. Despite the larger amount I applied to my arm, I find myself repeatedly bringing my nose close to smell anything. The longevity is mediocre.
In conclusion: I can only agree with my predecessors that ""Thunderstorm"" does not quite deliver what it promises. Regarding the question that arises with some Demeters, ""wearable or not?"" I can say that this one is indeed wearable on the skin; it is neither absolutely disgusting nor too abstract. However, personally, it is also too unremarkable for me and, above all, too little perceivable over time."

Gray is not boring.
Gray is colorful.
Gray is multifaceted."
Immortelle,07/06/2015,DonJuanDeCat,M,2046,,5,Not in the Eye of the Storm,"Well, my title is chosen a bit more dramatically than the fragrance is. This scent is supposed to imitate the atmosphere of how the air feels just before a thunderstorm. The good news is that the fragrance doesn’t smell bad; in fact, it smells quite pleasant. There isn't really any truly bad news. Who would have thought?!

The scent:
At first, I smell something slightly musty, something damp. Yes, it is fresh, slightly patchouli-vetiver-like, and has a hint of freshly cut grass and earth. After that, the impression is created as if one were standing next to a compost heap. It doesn't smell bad; it has a note that somewhat reminds me of Un Jardin sur le Toit by Hermès, which I find quite nice. But are these also the fragrant harbingers of rain? Well, it could very well be. Nevertheless, it smells more like fresh and damp nature, as if you are outside in the garden or in the woods. Perhaps also of damp earth and leaves.

The longevity is, as always, about two to four hours and is okay for such a fragrance.
The sillage is average; you can smell it well for a while. Moreover, it is not piercing and not overly intrusive.

I still don’t like the bottle. The bottle itself is adequate and just okay, but the sticker is too cheap. An image of thunderclouds or something would have been much more interesting.

Thunderstorm is a pretty good fragrance. Just the fact that it reminds me a bit of Un Jardin sur le Toit gives this scent extra points, as that doesn’t smell bad. The compost/nature-like notes smell pleasant, the fragrance is not overwhelming and could even be worn short-term. However, I still find that the scent doesn’t really remind me of a thunderstorm.
Nevertheless, I give it 75%, but unfortunately, I can only state it as 70%."
Immortelle,02/03/2025,Minigolf,F,2512,HELPFUL REVIEW,6,"Summer Thunderstorm! - Wind, not a Storm...","Here I have one of the sometimes slightly strange scents from ""Demeter Fragrance"" in front of and under my nose. The ""strange"" thing about this ""Thunderstorm"" is that it is a refreshing summer thunderstorm with a bit of brisk wind instead of a storm.
You can almost smell the rain in the humid air as dark clouds approach.
The sun is still shining, but the first thick drops are already falling. Result: A rainbow!
When it really starts with a heavy downpour, the air cools down immediately, becoming pleasantly fresh. All the grasses, trees, bushes, and perennials exhale a herbaceous-green, slightly earthy scent. The asphalt on paths and roads seems to be steaming. This can also be quite distinctly sniffed. For me, the EDC lasts much longer than indicated above, and the ""sillage"" is quite decent. I can't claim that it's one of my favorite scents, but it certainly smells better than often rated here. Only a slightly ""sharp"" undertone, which I can't describe more precisely, is a bit bothersome. Similar to fresh radish..
Otherwise, it's well wearable, especially in humid summer weather."
Immortelle,12/20/2013,Seerose,F,775,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,0,Good Compost,"With thunderstorm scent, I expect a smell of the hoped-for rain or a cooling down. The air is heavy, crackling. The flowers and plants smell more intense when it hasn’t been too dry beforehand. The lightning briefly creates an ozone smell when the storm is not too far away.
But ""Thunderstorm"" smells to me like good, well-made compost. Sprinkled on top are the already wilting flowers and the remnants of vegetable plants that are beginning to decompose. Among these plant remnants are also the very wilted-smelling short blades of grass from a mowed lawn. These green plants still exude a bit of the green but also coumarin, sweet and intrusive like woodruff tea. There are aquatic hints, but I'm not so sure about that.
Maybe a thunderstorm in another part of the world is meant?
""Thunderstorm"" is then also an oppressive smell. I have the urgent desire to close the compost bin again or to wash my wrist.
Neither is this a perfume nor a scent for scenting any rooms or containers. ""Thunderstorm"" is simply an attempt to imitate a scent that is supposed to smell like a thunderstorm. Unfortunately, I find that the attempt has failed. If ""Fragrance Library"" were not in the name, which suggests that the company ""Demeter"" wants to create a library of scents, I would simply note once again that name and smell do not match."
Immortelle,03/09/2010,Andi136,M,242,,6,Yuck!,"When I read the description of Thunderstorm, I was totally excited and curious about the scent.
I imagined a clean, aquatic fragrance, just like it smells before a summer thunderstorm. That heavy, yet clean air that you could cut through. You know what I mean.
So, I ordered it without smelling it first. 15 euros isn’t too much.
When I finally held the bottle in my hands and sniffed it, it almost fell out of my hand. Yuck! What is that supposed to be? A joke?
Thunderstorm smells incredibly earthy, a bit like potting soil. I don’t know what that has to do with a thunderstorm.
I can’t pick out any fragrance notes, I just don’t know.
I’m sorry, but if you wear this scent, you either smell like a gardener or like a potted plant.
For me, this is a classic case of missing the theme."
Immortelle,10/26/2010,Woelfin,F,243,,3,"Thunderstorm, huh?","Association 1:
Dry forest floor. I am lying on that very forest floor. Leaves. Earth. Stone. The feeling when a stone crumbles in your hand and the dusty, small particles slip through your fingers ...

Association 2:
A green greenhouse with a variety of different plants. Again, there is earth here. Fresh potting soil. My fingers brush against the leaves of the plants as I pass by. An irrigation system keeps the shrubs moist and the humidity relatively high.

Association 3:
A bench and a large tree. Sparse, stony ground. The grass of the wide meadows and fields is not green... but withered. It turns gray. Ravens land in the fields and call for their companions. The sun sets. Thick, gray clouds gather and the wind picks up. And now ... now it could actually start to thunder. And I sit there, on the bench, watching how good the impending rain will be for the wilting plants.

But since I am not suicidal and won’t stay on this bench during a thunderstorm, I prefer to observe the whole thing from a bit further away and must say:

This is an unusual scent. I do think that the theme here is just a tiny bit off, but if you approach it a little like I do and just associate a bit, you can definitely get on the right track.

I would even like to rate this scent remarkably well, with the note that this is not a (daily) wearable fragrance (no, really people! Better leave it!), but it is perfect for leaning back and dreaming."
Immortelle,10/07/2014,Somebody,F,227,,0,The murderer is (not) always the gardener,"I found a sample of Thunderstorm as a bonus in a swap package, and because the name intrigued me so much, I sprayed a dose of it on my arm without any prior research.
I couldn't help but exclaim ""THUNDERstorm!"" which already justifies the Thunder.

Like a whirlwind, images flashed through my mind in a matter of seconds:

- Forest floor with decaying leaves
- Damp moss under shady trees
- Sun-warmed stones on which the first raindrops fall
- A slightly brackish puddle full of algae
- Dense jungle, where one hacks a path with a machete
- Exuding plant sap from freshly cut thick stems

The chaos soon settles down, leaving behind the scent of juicy green, cut grass. Almost a bit bamboo-like; yes, I think I recognize certain parallels to Bambou by Yves Rocher.

These impressions fascinate me. I could easily imagine this fragrance as a backdrop to reading material like Simon Beckett or Kathy Reichs, which would certainly add a whole new dimension to certain descriptions.
Or as a complement to books/movies like ""Jungle Child"" or ""Gorillas in the Mist"".
I’ll have to search the shelf for suitable material…

But first, a big thank you to the generous donor for this equally fantastic and truly wearable scent!"
Immortelle,04/12/2010,DonVanVliet,M,287,,3,Another Earthy Scent from Demeter,"I believe Demeter has a knack for earthy scents. This is yet another one. Alongside the truly watery-earthy notes, I also perceive a few green elements, somewhat like cucumber or houseplants."

Cedrus Limited Edition,05/17/2024,Catchmynose,M,67,,3,The Gummy Bear Alternative,"Touché… The name evokes a nasty pressure in my stomach. Is it something about the scent? No!! I wasn’t outsmarted during fencing or a discussion, and I’m not sitting here - after a direct hit (Touché) - sulking in the corner.
What makes me feel queasy is the thought of a boy band of the same name that wreaked havoc in the early 2000s. Not only did the ""pop titan"" himself produce this musical disaster… but these ""musicians"" are more aptly described as a ""quirk of nature."" Just take a look at the pictures on Google…. or listen to one of their ""songs.""
Due to this association, I obviously don’t agree with the naming. Whether the people at LPDO have ever heard of this group is questionable. However, what this group definitely would have known is a little fragrance from Tiziana Terenzi.
Kirkè EXTRAIT DE PARFUM surely served as a godparent for this creation. But that doesn’t make the scent any worse…. and some even claim that TOUCHÉ is the better Kirke; but I won’t go that far…

I can perceive berries and peach… the rest of the ingredients, however, vanish in a fragrant cloud of sugary vacation vibes. Touché is not a freshie, as it performs too sticky for me. Already in the top note, I notice the biggest difference from Kirke, which continues to linger for a long 8 hours until the finale. Most call it ""synthetic""… I call it ""positively piercing."" OK… Kirke already experiences something like ""hate"" and is often labeled as ""chemical club"" or ""hairspray scent."" Now I could say: ""Just look up the word synthetic on Wikipedia… then you’ll find something about 'Touché' too""… but I won’t say that…. And why not? Because I like ""the thing."" Do you know those plastic twist-and-drink bottles? As a child, I loved that stuff. On every school trip or even on a trip to Hagenbeck, those sugary fruit juices with a delightful formaldehyde aftertaste were always there! And that’s exactly what TOUCHE reminds me of; and that’s POSITIVE! The sillage is also good and gives the surroundings the childish impression of a visit to the Bäderland-Hamburg. I don’t feel this connection with Kirke.
Price: Here the equation applies: 10x Touché = 1x Kirke; and you can certainly notice the extreme price difference as the TT hit feels softer and more mature (WHAT!!!! …the Kirke bashers will now exclaim… “That’s just not possible”).
Conclusion: An inexpensive alternative from Italy with a gummy bear flair. Not for everyone… Still: I LIKE!"
Chloe,02/28/2015,Tar,F,261,,3,Piece of a beautiful soul,"Masterpiece from my favourite perfumer – that is ESSENCES INSENSÉES.

Icing sugar peach lilac – the first breath, as your olfactory would be bombarded with shining, happy notes. If you take a deeper breath, it is easy to detect some biting spice, most probably the pepper (what else could be?). The fragrance is strong, confidently fresh, and 100% natural. The best face of niche – written here just to annoy GothicHeart :D

On the ground that I do not know all of the notes for sure, my nose makes easily mistakes, e.g. I feel chamomille. The scent of health. Bravo! This flower withers so fast... Dry and dead chamomille - The scent of sadness and too early farewell from life. If that was the intention, then bravo. If not, then: why the hell do I have to feel such grief at this stage???
...Especially after and before the beautiful springtime of head and base?

Till the end of heart ESSENCES INSENSÉES is the same with different body chemistries. The scent revives on lucky skin, and shows petals floating on clean water. Another drydown path is paved with herbs (mate?), is a bit sour, and shows in the last few hours a pretty, feminine and a bit boring mimosa. Where is the beeswax? In the head. Where is the vanille? In the head. Where is the violet? Mimosa kidnapped her to accompany her in the base.

As you can see, this fragrance involves me emotically very fast and deep, it is wonderful, and I can not keep myself away from the feelings that it makes arise. ESSENCES INSENSÉES is enough possessive to engage my thoughts for hours, nonetheless it is easy to wear. I like it. I love it. I hopelessly want to grab the volatile fineness of it."
Chloe,11/15/2016,Gentilhomme,M,120,,6,Nonsensical Essences,"Translating the name 1:1 from French raises the question of why?

Why are fragrances referred to as nonsensical essences... Has the manufacturer already supposedly enough sensible essences on the market and wants to market their formulations that have been languishing in storage under a slightly misleading name? No idea.

In any case, all 3 fragrances launched under this name so far are anything but nonsensical; each one is something special with a specific target audience. In 2014, mimosas were highlighted, in 2015 jasmine, and this year the rose has been put in a special light. The two fragrances from 2015 and 2016 are successful, but not to my taste.

The first formula from 2014 is different. However, one must have a certain preference for the quirky, tingling mimosa scent that runs like a red thread throughout the entire fragrance progression.

The fragrance starts green and slightly metallic; the violet blooms here only very briefly, as it does in nature, most of the time the small violet spring messengers are gone after a sunny day. The pink pepper also listed in the top note may be somewhere present, but is hardly noticeable.

The mimosa is already present in the top note and intensifies in the heart note. Anyone who has ever stood under a blooming mimosa tree in spring by the Mediterranean will immediately have this image in their mind.
The mimosa scent personally always reminds me a bit of blooming linden trees, which is why I would like to compare the fragrance a bit with Tilleul by D'Orsay. The beeswax note in the base further emphasizes this association. Farnesiana by Caron also caters to the same fragrance direction.

For me, the fragrance is the most successful of the ""Nonsensical Essences""; it is subtle and not overwhelming, yet it has good longevity and a pleasant sillage. Essences Insensées 2014 is unisex, which I cannot attribute to the other two fragrances from 2015 and 2016, as they are more suited for women.

Anyone who likes green floral scents, especially mimosas, should definitely test this fragrance; I am not sure, but I believe it is no longer being produced, as it is very rarely found."
Chloe,07/06/2015,Skjomi,F,51,VERY HELPFUL REVIEW,10,Here comes the Sun,"To start on a positive note, this fragrance smells like summer. Just like in the last few days, very very hot, many people at the outdoor pool lying on the grass and using plenty of sunscreen.

It initially starts very green, like freshly cut grass, the lawn in the morning, still dewy and freshly mowed. I seem to miss the violet and pepper.

But after just a few minutes, the sun rises mercilessly hot, and something sweet joins in, gaining more and more dominance, very sweet-almondy, almost like baking aroma, while being powdery vanilla-like. Spicy not in the classical sense, rather radiating the spicy sweetness of acacia honey. Here I really wondered why I perceive no flowers at all, and did some research. Heliotropin, which is used in perfumery, is described as powdery, vanilla-like, and almond-like; it is said to have a relaxing and comforting effect. That describes it very well, as it is the scent profile that absolutely defines and dominates this fragrance for me. Heliotrope also means: turning towards the sun. I don't know how mimosa smells, but the scent essence from it is derived from a type of acacia, which is said to have honey-like facets. I am a little reconciled with my nose again.

And then...? Unfortunately, nothing more comes. Grass and marzipan continue hand in hand in the height of summer and eventually make themselves comfortable on a blanket. There they stay, turned towards the sun and very relaxed.

I hope more comments will come, as I cannot assess the longevity; as you all know, fragrances that you don't like are very hard to wash off, so I find it quite long-lasting... Anyone who loves sweet gourmand fragrances, vanilla crescents, and especially marzipan should definitely come and sniff this! It is not my scent at all; I am not a heliotrope lover, and the aroma seems a bit overdosed-artificial to me.
I will trade the remaining sample for a second comment! :-)"
